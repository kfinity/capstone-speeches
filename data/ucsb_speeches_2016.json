Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. I am really delighted to be here on the first winter day of this season. [laughter]\nTo be here in this beautiful city and church that has been the site of a lot of occasions. And especially to be introduced by Brenda, who, as she said, I first met in a town hall in Dover all those months ago.\u00a0\nAnd you know, when you call on people in town halls, as you'll see in a minute, you have no idea what they're going to say or what they are going to ask. And when I called on her, she basically said I have a husband with early onset Alzheimer's, I have a mother with Alzheimer's. I'm taking care of them. What are you going to do about Alzheimer's?\nAnd it really caused me to think hard about the kind of president I want to be. Obviously, I want to be a president who gets the economy moving for everybody and get incomes rising and more good paying jobs. And I want to be a president that keeps us safe and secure, and takes on the threat and dangers that we face.\nBut I also want to be a president who works for families, like Brenda's. Who understands that the problems we keep you up at night are ones that we also have to take seriously. So, it means the world to me to have her support in this campaign.\nAnd as I've said to her and to others who have raised issues with me during the course of my time here in New Hampshire, I will do everything I can to try and find answers. You know, in Alzheimer's, as she said, we have got five million people currently suffering. The projection is for many millions more.\nIt is the sixth leading cause of death in America. But unlike the other causes in the top ten, there is no real path to prevention or effective treatment, or a cure, as there is with other diseases that take so many lives.\nSo, my proposal is that we tackle all three of those. What can we do to try and prevent it? What can we do to try to more effectively treat it? And what would it take to invest in finding a cure? And after talking to experts, the leading experts in our country\u2014not just in Alzheimer's, but in other neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's, the overwhelming response was, if we invested just $2 billion more a year, we would make tremendous progress.\nAnd we would have a real shot at understanding more about this disease and trying to cure it. And the heavens support what we are going to do on behalf of Alzheimer's, and the patients, the families and the caregivers. [applause]\nSo, I want to thank my friend Terry Narelli , who I see here, for her great service and leadership over so many years, and for her friendship. And I want to just make a few other quick acknowledgments. And then we will move on to be ready for the questions.\nThe mayor. I want to thank the mayor. Where is Mayor Lister? I saw him earlier. He's here somewhere. There he is. There he is. Thank you so much, Mayor. Wonderful to see you, thank you for your support. And to the South Church, thank you for letting us be here today. [applause]\nAnd to the overflow, which I stopped by to see on my way here. It was packed. We thank you for your patience. They have got a big screen, they are having a good time watching. And we are delighted they are here as well.\nAs Brenda said, on January 20, 2017, someone will raise a hand and take the oath of office, and become our 45th president. That person will, after being sworn in, and the celebrations that go with an inauguration, go into the White House, go into the oval office, and face the challenges that await.\nThis will be a consequential election in so many ways. Because we have work to do. I'm excited about the work. I'm confident and optimistic about the work we can do together. [applause]\nBut I need all of you to be part of this campaign, to be part of the first in the nation primary, because in many ways, you are the first\u2014or depending on how you define it, the last line of defense.\nThe decision that New Hampshire makes is so important. And I've had a great time traveling across the state, meeting, by now, thousands and thousands of people. Having a chance to set forth my ideas and answer questions on whatever might be on someone's mind.\nAnd I know that we are going to make the right decision\u2014not because my name will be on the ballot, but because all of us know what the stakes are, and how high they happen to be.\nSo I'm excited and very much looking forward to the sprint towards the primary and to have a chance to hear even more for more folks here in the granite state about what is on your mind, about the big economic challenges, the security issues, and all those problems they keep you up at night.\nI have learned a lot listening to folks here in New Hampshire. I learned a lot about the struggles, the opportunities, the disappointments. As you know, I have had two full town hall meetings just on the issue of substance abuse. When I made a list of what I was going to talk about in this campaign, it wasn't on that list.\nBut on my first trip here to New Hampshire in Keene, that was what was raised with me. And then on visit after visit, I was given mass cards showing the pictures of beautiful young people no longer with us because of overdoses. I met those in recovery, who thankfully, were able to get help when they needed it. I met grandmothers like myself, raising children because their children couldn't, lost to opioid addiction, heroin addiction. So that's why taking the big issue to me.\nI will never stop leading with the values that I was raised with about who we are as Americans, what we're capable of doing. I will never stop listening, learning about what's on people's minds. I think you actually learn more when you listen. And I will never stop trying to work with you to solve problems.\nThat's the America that I was raised in, that's the America that I think we all cherish and that's the America that I'm going to do everything I can as your president to make sure it's stronger and better and fairer for everybody going forward. [applause]\nSo let me now turn to all of you and if you raise your hand, I think we have some microphones somewhere that we will try to get to you and give you a chance. This young\u2014this woman right there. Yes, right there. Yes. Please stand up. Great.\nQUESTION: Hi. Hi. This is such an honor. You look stunning and I've always wanted to talk with you. [applause]\nI have been on your bandwagon since you were first lady. We are nine days apart, but I know why you look so much better, because you're younger. [laughter]\nBut it's a dream come true to have this interaction. As a cancer survivor, three years ago and going through surgery, chemo, radiation, and having a job I loved, I was let go from my job in the private sector. However, I did come to redo myself as a justice of the peace in Massachusetts and I work now with elderly through Brookline Council on aging.\nAnd I have seen people up close and personal that are delights, as well as being able to hear them. And one of the issues I have heard lately is the hearing is a problem and that they cannot afford to buy hearing aids because they are thousands of dollars. As a senior myself now, the affordable health care for getting the supplements to Medicare is an issue as well, because if you're not\u2014if you're too far above $100, $200 above the guidelines for Medicaid or mass health, then you cannot\u2014you have to pay full prices to supplements, but the seniors are saying they need help in hearing.\nCLINTON: Have any of you heard this before, that seniors who need help with hearing can't afford to get the hearing aids because the hearing aids are so expensive? This is something that... [applause]\nI think a lot of people thought we would figure out a way to solve in the Affordable Care Act, but we haven't yet, and it's something that I take really seriously because if you can't hear well, very often, people kind of withdrawal and they become more isolated, and in fact, some of the recent research shows that, you know, that can be a trigger for other kinds of conditions and diseases.\nSo I don't think hearing aids when you can't hear are a luxury, I think they're a necessity. And I'm going to do everything I can... [applause]\n... to move\u2014to move them from what would be the elective list to a supported list so that people who have financial problems will be able to get help to afford them because you're 100 percent right.\nIt's a growing concern, in part because we have a lot more people living longer and part because we have a lot more people losing their hearing earlier. Some people say it's because of loud music that some of us remember listening to, but for whatever reason it might be, there are a lot of issues around it. So I'm going to do what I can to make sure we make hearing aids financially available on a sliding scale so more people who need them can actually get them. [applause]\nYeah, this gentleman right there. Yeah, right there in the yellow tie. Here comes the microphone.\nQUESTION: Good afternoon. My name is Mr. Rogers. I happen to be in your neighborhood. [laughter]\nI have a message for you; I'm from Liberia. Liberia, we elected the first female president in the continent of Africa. You already talked about... [applause]\n... your hand is raised up to take that oath. I'm here on behalf of the Republic of Liberia, from Johnson-Sirleaf the president of Liberia, to say hi to you.\nSince 5 o'clock this morning\u2014I don't know where I was going\u2014I have to find my way here. But do me one favor. I want to take a picture with you and send it to her that I was here as I promised. [laughter]\nIf you don't mind please. If you don't mind.\nCLINTON: We will do that when we finish. Don't let me forget, and I have a feeling you won't. [laughter]\nBut the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who has been elected twice\u2014as you rightly say, the first woman president anywhere on the continent of Africa\u2014has been... [applause]\n... has been an extraordinary leader. I mean, she inherited an economy and a government that was bankrupt. They had had this terrible long civil war that had just destroyed so much of the productive capacity in addition to taking so many lives and leaving so many maimed and injured people behind, and a lot of Liberians left Liberia because of the lack of safety.\nShe has been, I think, incredibly focused on trying to improve the government, improve the economy. Then she was dealt the terrible blow of Ebola and all that it meant to her country. And I want to tell you just a quick story because it's good to remember how important it is to keep trying to work with people even if you have serious disagreements with them.\nI went to visit President Sirleaf when I was secretary of State and got a big briefing from all of her top officials about what was happening in her government and what they were trying to accomplish, and then I was supposed to go speak to the parliament, their Congress. And she took me aside and she said I want you to go and speak about how hard democracy is, how hard we must work together, how we have to move past the past and then said to me some of the very people who are now in the parliament were people who were very much involved in the civil war and some of the terrible things that happened there.\nThe leaders went to war crimes tribunal, but others for whom there wasn't evidence or they played minor roles were actually elected. Well, you can imagine. So I go to the parliament and I speak about democracy and all the rest of it and take some pictures and do some visits afterwards, and I thought boy, we think we have it hard, here she is trying to work with a Congress that includes people who were mortal enemies with one another against her, against others, and she's working so hard to make this democracy what it should be against tremendous odds.\nSo when we complain about our problems here in this country, we need to put them into some perspective and we need to figure out how we're going to work together even with people we disagree with... [applause]\n... going into the future. So thank you. We'll take a picture, I promise. OK, we've got this young lady in the red. Yeah. And then I'll go further back to...\nQUESTION: Thank you so much for being here and taking my question.\nI am the mother of a 16-year-old boy who is smart and beautiful, but he also really struggles with mental illness and he's currently in an in-patient program right now. And I think my family, I think anyone would agree that my family has incredibly great health insurance. And I know that mental health parity is the law. But we still have to fight for every single admission, every single bit of treatment that we have asked for him\u2014that the experts, his doctors who know him well all agree that this is what he needs to get better. And the health insurance company constantly tries to whittle it down and only provide the minimum amount.\nAnd, you know, as a parent with a sick child, I only have so much energy to fight this fight and something just really needs to be done.\nCLINTON: How many of you know somebody with mental health problems? [applause]\nHow many of you know how difficult it is to get the medical care you need to help somebody with mental health problems?\nWhat\u2014what you're describing is exactly the case. We passed a law\u2014I remember voting for it back in the day\u2014and then there was another law passed and it was incorporated in the Affordable Care Act, for what they call parity for mental health. In other words, if you have a physical illness, whatever it might be, you're supposed to get treated for it. If you have a mental health illness, you need to get treated for that, too.\nNumber one, we need finally to remove the stigma from mental health, because... [applause]\n... too often I hear from parents who say, \"I no longer even tell people that my son has schizophrenia; my daughter is bipolar; my child has got, you know, chronic depression, because I feel like I'm judged.\" No. We're learning more about how the brain operates. That's one of the things we want to do. That's part of what my goal is for Alzheimer's research. We have to understand the brain. We have to unlock its secrets. I really applaud President Obama for the investment in the brain project that his administration has made.\nSo we need to remove the stigma and we need to enforce the law so you get the quality and the number of treatments you need, whether it's out-patient or in-patient. And I'm going to work with the mental health community, which has laid out an agenda about how we get this right once and for all, because it's not fair. It's not fair to the person suffering and it's certainly not fair to the families who are trying to cope with that suffering and get the medical care that is needed.\nSo I'll do everything I can to make it somewhat easier for you and your son going forward. [applause]\nYes, this young man right here.\nQUESTION: When you become president... [crosstalk]\nQUESTION: When you become president, what is your plan to connect mental health problems and guns to make sure that me, my brothers and my friends are safe from violence at school?\nCLINTON: Oh, wow. [applause]\nI'm going to do everything I can do. And I'm never going to stop trying. Because right now, we lose 90 people a day to gun violence\u2014homicides, suicides and tragic avoidable accidents. That's 33,000 people a year. I think we need to pass the laws that I have been advocating for. We need comprehensive background checks. We need to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. [applause]\nAnd we need to make sure that the information that is needed to make the judgment about whether someone is qualified to buy a gun is in the record. And very often, we don't have real-time information because we also have to close what's called the Charleston loophole, where the killer in Charleston went to buy a gun. He filled out the form. Under the loophole, he could come back and get it after three business days. The information that he wasn't eligible because he had a felony conviction didn't come through until after he went\u2014used that gun and murdered nine people in a church like this in Charleston.\nSo we have work to do. And the mental health piece of this is especially troubling, because you don't want to unfairly stigmatize people, but you want to protect the community, so you've got to have information. The killer at Virginia Tech, you might remember, had been committed. But that information was not in the records.\nWe need to prohibit people who are drastic abusers with restraining orders against them from getting guns. And we certainly should get the Congress to prohibit anyone who is on the no-fly list, the would-be terrorists, from buying guns in America. And... [applause]\nCLINTON: ... and we need to repeal the immunity from liability that was given to gun makers and sellers by the Congress... [applause]\n... so that we can do as good a job as possible trying to prevent people who shouldn't have guns in the first place from getting them. And I know we can do this in a constitutionally consistent way.\nSo I'm going to reach out. I'll work with anybody, but I will also continue to advocate for this, because we are in a whole different era, where these mass shootings, these 33,000 people killed every year, has become a rebuke to us, that we can't figure\u2014figure out how to deal with this. And I, personally, am asking gun owners to support these changes. Because right now, what I just outlined\u2014comprehensive background checks and the like\u2014is supported by 92 percent of Americans and 85 percent of gun owners. But the gun lobby lives off of fear and misinformation and is willing to say and do whatever it takes... [applause]\nCLINTON: And it is really time for gun owners to form a different organization that will do more on gun safety, do more on gun responsibility, and stand up for the safety of our children and our communities. [applause]\nCLINTON: OK. This gentleman with the cap on has been standing up. So why\u2014why don't you ask the next question, sir?\nQUESTION: Thank you so much, Hillary. First and foremost, I want to say that I love you. [laughter]\nAnd I really mean it.\nAnd so\u2014my name is James Mackey , I'm a community organizer for a non-profit organization called Teen Empowerment. And what we do is we hire young people to talk about issues, and we create initiatives around those issues to build relationships with young people in the community.\nAnd so, I work in Boston, Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, all the\u2014all the... [applause]\n... thank you. All the communities that are underserved. And so my question to you is, is that\u2014so we just lost one of our youth organizers, two days ago, from a tragic accident. And there are 5.6 million young people around our nation who are 16 to 24, who are disconnected from school as well as from work.\nAnd when they are not in school or at work, what are they doing? And\u2014and plus, they're in underserved communities. And so my question to you is, what is your stance on supporting young people who really need opportunity, and more resources out there for better education, as well as better employment? And what will you do as president to help support those 5.6 million young people around the nation who it is affecting? Yeah. [applause]\nCLINTON: Thank you. Thank you. And first of all, thank you for being an organizer and reaching out to young people. That is so important. And... [applause]\n... I hope you heard what he said, because think about this number: 5.6 million young people between 16 and 24, who are neither in school nor at work. That is a recipe for unemployment, for incarceration, for all kinds of behavior that has bad consequences for themselves and for their families.\nAnd it's something I care deeply about, because if you look at where we are, underserved communities have had a resurgence of poverty. Inner-cities, old suburbs, small towns and rural areas, Native American reservations, coal country, this is across America where we have disconnected young people from a path to a productive life.\nAnd I think we've got to figure out how we rebuild that. So I am absolutely committed and I am going to say quickly three things. I want to support programs like what you described you do, because we've got to get people in the communities\u2014it's literally a one on one project in many cases.\nWhat is it that can be done for John or Mary or whomever? So we need to support nonprofit groups, advocacy groups, organizing groups, faith communities to do this work. But secondly, we have to take a hard look. And one of the ideas that I have been thinking about is we take a hard look at communities where you have very persistent poverty, poor education outcomes, other kinds of indicators of problems.\nAnd we really have to figure out what works. People have tried a whole bunch of different things, and a lot of it doesn't work. Throwing money at it doesn't necessarily work. Building relationships is the work that has to be done. How do we do that?\nI don't think the answer lies in Washington, although as president, I can be a convener, a coordinator, a catalyst. I think we have to do this in communities. And I want to provide support and resources, where possible, to give more people a chance to do that relationship building.\nWe are going to need more GED programs very we need more community college programs. We are going to need more apprenticeship programs. We're going to need more pathways out. And we are going to have to also take a hard look at the living conditions and the schooling conditions that a lot of these kids face.\nI used to have what I would call the Chelsea test, when I would go into the school. And as the first lady in Arkansas, the first lady in the United States or the Senator in New York, I would walk into a school and I would spend some time, I would look around. I would look at the physical facilities, I'd talk to the staff area and I would say, would I want my daughter to go to the school?\nA lot of times the answer was yes, absolutely. A lot of time the answer was no. Some of the conditions, the physical conditions in these schools was deplorable. And then you have to look at the housing that a lot of people are living in. A lot of this housing is really substandard but in dangerous ways. and I will just end with this.\nLead paint poisoning effects many, many children in the northeast, the mid-atlantic, and the midwest, where we had a lot of old housing. Where we have old pipes on water supplies. Lead poisoning is an academic and behavioral deficits inducement. People end up being worse off. And we are not doing enough to notice it, to deal with it, to eradicate it.\nSo there's a lot I think we have to take a hard look at. And I will do that. But it will be in partnership with young people like you and the groups you recognize and represent. Thank you. [applause]\nCLINTON: I see a hand way back there. Yes, yes. Black and white, yes. Right there. Yes.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. It is an honor. I'm from Alabama and I know it is important for candidates to focus on undecided voters in swing states. But for liberals and conservatives states, we sometimes feel left out of the fray.\nAnd I would hope that the Democratic Party and your campaign will go into those conservative states and really push and give us hope and encouragement that your platforms will be heard there. And I ask you, please don't leave us to the Republicans. [laughter] [applause]\nCLINTON: Well, I have been down to Alabama twice already in this campaign. And I will do my best to help rebuild the Democratic Party in places where it hasn't been particularly successful in recent years. Because I think there is a lot we can recommend. I really do.\nI think that our view about what we need to do to get the economy going again, and fix all the problems that we see with the Affordable Care Act, and get early childhood education\u2014you know, there is a very inconvenient fact that my Republican friends hate when I mention. But it is true. Our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House. [applause]\nAnd that is true in Alabama, just like it's true anywhere. And we are going to make that case, do the very best we can to kind of get people to recognize that we are all in this together. And getting the economy to work better, getting our government to be more effective and productive in producing results, building on the progress that President Obama made it\u2014remember, he inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Recession.\nAnd then he had to make sure it didn't fall into a Great Depression. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure that did not happen. [applause]\nSo, we are going to make that case. We are going to make that case throughout the country. I hope, effectively. At least, I'm counting on that. Yes, the man in the blue vest. Yeah, yeah.\nQUESTION: This is an honor. I'm a retired teacher from Massachusetts. I've never been involved in any political aspects. I've\u2014we are about the same age, actually, Hillary. So, it's only\u2014I respect one woman in my life, which is my wife.\nYou are the No. 2 woman I respect more than any woman on this planet. I have watched you since your\u2014you know, your early political days. We are both grandparents of very young grandchildren. I'm a little bit nervous here.\nBut I just wanted to tell you that there is one thing that has\u2014in the minds of most people\u2014we have doubt. We have doubt about so many things that we've hoped for, and we've seen evolve.\nYou eliminate doubt for someone like me. You eliminate doubt. I have\u2014your knowledge and your grasp of what's happening, and what you've been through, and what you see\u2014and things that you know that we don't know are what make me feel confident that you were going to be the next president. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you. There is a little hand right there, that little girl right there. I like having all of these young people here.\nQUESTION: Hi. Hi, I'm Ella. I think that there is a lot of people who don't have enough money for college, and schools and that kind of stuff. So, how can we help that?\nCLINTON: It's a very good question, Ella. [applause]\nThat is a great question. How many people have student debt, or ever had student debt? Guess that's nearly everybody here, practically. Look, I think there are two things, two big things we have to do. First, I want to make college debt-free, so that you don't have to borrow money for tuition to go to a four-year public college or university. [applause]\nAnd it will work, because what we are going to do is to focus on it being a compact between the federal government and state governments, and institutions. Because I do think that colleges and universities have to take a really hard look at what they are spending money on. [applause] So, that they make sure what they are spending on is related to helping prepare a student for life, for profession or career. I think states have dis-invested in higher education. A lot of the money that states use to put into colleges and universities has gone into everything from prisons to roads, you name it.\nSo, we got to figure out how the state does more of its fair share. I think that in order for it to be debt free, families above a certain income level will have to continue to fund college. I think that's only fair. And I want students to work 10 hours a week. Because I want students to know they are working for their education. And that it's something they really value. [applause]\nAnd I want to do more on national service so more students get big discounts because they will have done national service. Military service, civilian service. [applause]\nAnd we've got a good G.I. bill now coming after 9\/11\u2014a new G.I. bill for the new generation of vets, but I want to make sure they don't get ripped off because sometimes that veteran education money is going to institutions that don't really serve them well. So we have some work to do to make sure that it is done right.\nAnd then I want to help you pay down your debt by refinancing your debt. Just like you can refinance a mortgage or a car payment, you ought to be able to refinance your college debt. [applause]\nAnd it really is quite disturbing to me that we have had, as everybody knows in the last several years, because of the great recession, mostly\u2014we've had really low interest rates. And yet, when I ask students what interest rate they are paying on their debt, lots of them are paying six, seven, eight, nine, 10 percent. Some of it private, some of it to the government. And I do not believe the federal government should be making a profit off of lending money to students to be able to go get a college education. [applause]\nSo we're going to\u2014we're going to make a lot of changes, Ella. So certainly by the time you get there, but hopefully sooner, we will have a lot of good changes that you'll be able to take advantage of.\nYes. There's a lady right here and maybe\u2014let's see. Here comes the microphone. Right there.\nQUESTION: Thank you for coming to Portsmouth. I was very disappointed in the last debate that the international agreement on climate that was agreed upon in Paris was not even mentioned. So could you comment on that and tell us as president, what you would do?\nCLINTON: Yes. I happen to think the... [applause]\nThe Paris agreement was a historic achievement and I give a lot of credit to President Obama's leadership because if the United States had not led, it would not have happened, and I know how hard it was, because President Obama and I went to the big international climate meeting in Copenhagen in 2009. And literally, we could not even get a meeting with the Chinese, the Indians, the South Africans and the Brazilians.\nLed by the Chinese, who did not want to have a meeting with us where they might make a commitment to actually doing anything. And so we had to chase them around this big convention center in Copenhagen, and we finally found them. Chinese guards were preventing the entry in and the president is a lot taller than I am, and so he just kind of pushed through in the hands went up so I ducked under and we got in the room. [laughter]\nAnd then, you know, the president says, \"We've been looking all over for you.\" We pulled up chairs and we sat down and we said, \"You know, look, we have to begin this process.\" And their argument was the typical argument. \"We didn't cause the problem. It was the developed countries.\" We said, \"Look, that's fine, but you are now the biggest emitters and you are going to have to help solve the problems,\" and they began to agree to do some internal accounting and public reporting.\nFast forward from '09, we had a series of climate meetings in Cancun and Durban, and we made progress. So the agreement coming out of Paris does, for the first time, include every nation, regardless of level of development or need or threat from climate change.\nAnd now, we have to enforce it. So as president, I would do everything I can, using every tool that I had to hold other nations accountable, including our own, about what we need to do both to try desperately to move more quickly away from fossil fuels towards clean, renewable energy, to try to at least put a cap on temperature rise and emissions and try the best we can at the same time to do more on resilience and adaptation to try and help countries and parts of countries that are particularly at risk.\nPortsmouth is the seacoast city. You all\u2014I know the mayor and everybody, you're working hard on resilience and you're really taking a hard look, but you need a partner in Washington and in the Congress, as well as the president. There are a lot of places in our country\u2014Alaska has already been hit hard. They've had to relocate some villages from the coastline. I know that Miami is really facing some big challenges.\nSo we've got to get serious about this because it's happening. We are seeing the results of this drastic increase in temperature that human activity has not just contributed to, but caused. So, it's time for us to... [applause]\n... deal with the problem, but I believe it's also a great opportunity. And this is what I have a hard time understanding from my Republican counterparts. You know, they all are into denial and when asked about climate change typically will say well I don't know, I'm not a scientist. You know, the answer to that is go talk to one... [laughter]\n... and listen to what the scientists tell you, and... [applause]\n... so from my perspective, we have economic opportunities here that we're leaving on the table. We can do so much more, putting people to work in wind, in solar, in advanced biofuels. We can make a difference in the economy with new, good-paying jobs. And I will say this. You know, when I'm not in New Hampshire, I'm often in Iowa. Iowa now produces one-third of its electricity from renewables, predominantly wind.\nSeven thousand people now work in the wind industry. They are now assembling turbines in old, abandoned factories, they are educating young people in the community colleges to actually work on these turbines. So they have gone the whole supply chain, and good for them. Every state should be doing the same. Every state has that same economic potential here... [applause]\n... and when we\u2014when we let politics, really politics that are under the thumb of the fossil fuel industry\u2014and in particular, the Koch Brothers\u2014decide the future of our country, shame on us. We're better than that, we're smarter than that, and we all\u2014Republican, Democrat, Independent, whatever\u2014we all need to say we are taking on this challenge and we're going to make jobs and incomes rise because of it. That to me is the right approach for us to be taking. [applause]\nOh my goodness. So many hands, so little time. Well, you're standing right there. Why don't we go with that lady right there. Yeah.\nQUESTION: Hi, thank you. I've spent a lot of time teaching art in women's prisons, and the majority of the women I've worked with are from minority, low-income families and the majority of them are in their second, third, fourth visits to prison, and they say it's easier to just live in that cycle than try to break out of it. How would you approach helping end that cycle? [applause]\nCLINTON: First of all, thank you for working in our prisons. You know, we are still in the midst of the holiday season, and for those of us who celebrate Christmas, it's good to remember that we are called upon to care for the homeless and the stranger and the prisoner, the refugee.\nThose are important reminders at a time when there's so much political dispute about all of this, and I think we have incarcerated too many people. We have 5 percent of the world's population... [applause]\n... but 25 percent of the prison population, and we actually have one-third of women who are imprisoned anywhere in the world imprisoned in the Untied States. So we have to begin in a thoughtful way to deal with the effects of incarceration.\nObviously, from my perspective, we need to take a hard look at the low-level, non-violent offenses for which people end up incarcerated. We have to take a hard look at our bail system because we have too many people in jail and prison who haven't even been tried yet. We don't know if they're guilty of anything other than poverty because they can't meet the bail that has been set for them. And we need to do a careful analysis of who can and should be released from prison while we try to deal with people who don't pose a threat to the community, particularly the numbers of people with low-level drug offenses who need treatment, not imprisonment. And so we've got to look at all of this and... [applause]\n... yet, I don't think that's enough, and it goes back to the gentleman's question over there in the hat. The issue is, OK, if we're going to divert people from prison, what are the things we're going to do?\nWell, I'm a big believer in drug courts, I think drug courts are a much better option than imprisoning people. They should be given recovery, they should be held accountable. I believe that there are more programs that are cheaper and better.\nAnd I want to just quickly tell you about a program I visited in Reno, Nevada. And it was a program originally started for alcoholics\u2014people that were found on the street and were picked up, taken to jail. A month later, they'd be on the street again, taken to jail, or maybe they'd end up being put into an ambulance, taken to the emergency room, maybe admitted. A month or two later, back on the street.\nSo, a really great partnership between the county sheriff's office and Catholic charities said, \"there's gotta be a better way. First of all, it's really expensive to jail and imprison people.\" So they built a facility that had small bedrooms, that had work to be done, that offered this option to people they were picking up, saying, \"you can either go back to jail, back to\u2014you know, the life you've had, or you can try this.\"\nAnd they got enough people to try it. They tested them three times a day to make sure they weren't cheating. And the sheriff said to me\u2014he said, \"you know\u2014want to know the best thing about this?\" He said, \"because I can\u2014I can justify this anywhere.\"\nHe said the first year, the sheriff's office and the hospital and the jail saved $4 million, because they were no longer putting people in high, intensive places like jails and emergency rooms.\nNow they're moving on to drug addiction, because we've got to think differently about how to help people overcome the problems that they confront. And I just don't think jail is a place for people with substance abuse or mental health problems. And therefore, we need different approaches... [applause]\n... that will be actually better and cheaper. So let's\u2014let's try to figure out how we're gonna do that, too.\nThis young man.\nQUESTION: Hi. I have a dad that works for people with developmental disabilities. And I have an uncle with autism. And I was wondering, what are some of the ways that you can help people with disabilities and people with special needs that need help?\nCLINTON: Great question. You know, thanks. [applause]\nThank you dad for us, too, OK? Is your dad here? Thanks, Dad.\nYeah. People with disabilities\u2014you know, I was very proud that the United States became the first nation in the world to open schools to people with disabilities. And it was the\u2014I worked on that, when I was with the Children's Defense Fund. And we went door to door, asking people, \"do you have a school-age child who's not in school?\"\nAnd we found a blind kids and kids in wheelchairs and kids with behavioral problems, and then gave all that data to the Congress, and the Congress acted, and schools were opened. And then the\u2014the Americans With Disabilities Act was passed, another great accomplishment. A bipartisan accomplishment that really made a huge difference. [applause]\nSo now we have to do more to make sure that we provide supportive housing, that we support families. The biggest concern people talk to me about when they have children with disabilities, and particularly with autism, is what happens when they are no longer there to take care of their children, and how will that work out.\nI'm actually rolling out a plan about autism in about a week, where I talk about all the different things... [applause]\n... that we need to do to try to support families and people who are diagnosed as on the autism-spectrum disorders.\nHow many of you know somebody with autism? Wow. Wow. Well, you know, the latest data from the Centers on Disease Control is that -you know, 1 out of 68 children have some feature that would place them on the autism spectrum.\nSo that's something we need to deal with. So we're\u2014we'll be addressing that. But I guess my bottom line would be we\u2014we, as communities, need to support families and need to support people with disabilities so that they can go as far as their talent, their hard work, their skills will take them.\nAnd I think there are a lot of opportunities that we're just learning about that we can apply, and that I will talk about when I roll this out.\nI've just been told this is my last question. And so\u2014oh, my goodness. This is totally\u2014I should not have said that. This is totally, totally unfair. Oh my gosh. I\u2014I ...\nQUESTION: Here! Here! [laughter]\nCLINTON: You\u2014OK. So you've got promoters right here. This young man, right there? OK. You got a whole team here that is\u2014is giving you a chance. Go ahead. Because I really do love to call on kids, because that's what this election is actually all about, is their future. [applause]\nQUESTION: My name is Relic Riley. I'm from Massachusetts, and my mother over there is complaining that she does not get much more money than my father. My mother is an... [laughter] [applause]\nMy mother is an engineer. I meant teacher. My father's the engineer. And I\u2014I think that my mother is working more harder than my... [laughter] [applause]\nI don't know my grammar. I just don't know my grammar.\nI think my mother isn't working much harder\u2014is working more harder than my father, and she deserves to have more money. [laughter]\nLike, get more money than my father. [laughter]\nBecause she's taking care of children, and\u2014I just don't think it's fair.\nCLINTON: That is really so sweet. [applause]\nCLINTON: I\u2014you have a great future as an advocate, and\u2014look, I\u2014I do think equal pay for equal work is still a problem. And I think the Paycheck Fairness Act, which I supported every year it came up when I was in the Senate, is really important to try to open up the\u2014the pay arena to more transparency.\nBecause right now, if you are doing a job, and you ask how much somebody else makes, you can be fired or retaliated against. And how are we ever gonna know that we get fair pay for\u2014you know, not just women, although that's the biggest discrepancy, but particularly people who are in\u2014you know, positions where it's hard to ask for more, because of their\u2014you know, their working conditions.\nI had a young man here in New Hampshire tell me the reason he was supporting me is because I was in favor of equal pay. And when I asked him why, he said because he got his first grown-up adult job when he was 17, and he went to work in the same store where his mother had worked\u2014that's how he got the job\u2014and, his first pay period, brought his paycheck home, he showed his mother, and he watched her face fall.\nAnd he asked her why, and she said, \"you're making more now than I am making after four years on the same job.\" And I said to him\u2014I said, so what was the reason? I mean, how\u2014how did this add up?\nHe said, \"you know, I tried to find out,\" and he said, \"basically the manager said, 'well, we like to identify young men who can go far in the company, and so we want to give you the incentive to stay and maybe get into one of our training programs.'\"\nAnd I really\u2014this young man was very touching. He said, \"but they never asked my mom, and she's much more organized than I am.\" [laughter]\nSo I think that we still have problems, and if you deny those problems, you are denying the fastest way to increase incomes in America. And that is to make sure women are paid what they deserve in the job that they do. [applause]\nThank you all, very much. Thank you. [applause]\n","1":"\nThank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.\nI'm delighted to be here at this great university, one of the premier public institutions of higher education in our entire country. Yes, indeed. Just, you know, one of those statements of fact that deserves a response.\nI want to thank my longtime friend, Vice President Mondale, for his kind words. His support in this campaign means a great deal to me personally, because I admire so much his service to our country. He is a great Minnesotan and a great American, and we're so privileged to have him with us today.\nI also want to acknowledge a few of the other elected officials who are here. I am, of course absolutely delighted to be joined by former colleagues and friends, your senators, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, who are quite the dynamic duo for your state. And I am grateful to them for everything they're doing and for their help and support of my campaign.\nI also want to thank Tina Smith, your lieutenant governor, and Steve Simon, your secretary of state.\nAnd I understand that Betsy Hodges is here, Mayor of Minneapolis.\nAnd I also want to acknowledge the dean of the Humphries School, Eric Schwartz. Eric was my top advisor on refugee issues at the State Department. I also had the great privilege of working with him when he was on the National Security Council during my husband's administration. You know, he brings a mix of expertise and empathy that has been conspicuously missing from much of our public debate.\nAnd I am grateful he is here today, but I'm also a little jealous that all of you here at the university get to have the benefit of his experience.\nYou know, over the past several months, I have listened to the problems that keep American families up at night. Now, most people don't expect life to be easy, but they do want more security, a good-paying job that lets you afford a middle class lifestyle, health care you can count on, a little bit put away for your retirement.\nBeing secure also means being safe, safe at home, at school, at work. And today, I want to talk about how we keep our country safe from a threat that's on everyone's minds, the threat of terrorism.\nBut I want to begin by saying, we cannot give in to fear. We can't let it stop us from doing what is right and necessary to make us safe, and doing it in way that is consistent with our values.\nWe cannot let fear push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe. Americans are going to have to act with both courage and clarity.\nNow, as we all know, on December 2nd, two shooters killed 14 people at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California.\nSadly, in America in 2015, turning on the news and hearing about a mass shooting is not unusual. But this one turned out to be different, because these killers were a husband and wife inspired by ISIS.\nAmericans have experienced terrorism before. On 9\/11, we learned that terrorists in Afghanistan could strike our homeland. From Fort Hood to Chattanooga to the Boston Marathon, we saw people radicalized here carrying out deadly attacks.\nBut San Bernardino felt different. Maybe it was the timing, coming so soon after Paris. Maybe it was how random it seemed, a terrorist attack in a suburban office park, not a high-profile target or symbol of American power. It made us all feel it could have been anywhere, at any time.\nThe phrase \"active shooter\" should not be one we have to teach our children. But it is.\nAnd now we are all grappling with what all this means for our future, for our safety, our sense of well-being, and our trust and connections with our neighbors. We want to be open-hearted, and we want to celebrate America's diversity, not fear it.\nAnd while we know the overwhelming majority of people here and around the world hate ISIS and love peace, we do have to be prepared for more terrorists plotting attacks.\nJust yesterday, a man in Maryland was charged with receiving thousands of dollars from ISIS for use in planning an attack. And here in Minnesota, authorities have charged ten men with conspiring to provide material support to ISIS.\nBut in the Twin Cities, you have also seen firsthand how communities come together to resist radicalization: local imams condemning terrorist violence, local artists and activists pushing back against terrorist propaganda.\nI just met with a group of community leaders who told me about some of the work and the challenges that they are dealing with.\nAs the first Somali-American police sergeant in Minnesota, and probably in the country, said recently, \"Safety is a shared responsibility, so we have to work together.\"\nThe threat we face is daunting. But America has overcome big challenges many times before. Throughout our history, we've stared into the face of evil and refused to blink. We beat Fascism, won the Cold War, brought Osama bin Laden to justice.\nSo no one should ever underestimate the determination of the American people. And I am confident we will once again choose resolve over fear. And we will defeat these new enemies, just as we've defeated those who've threatened us in the past.\nBecause it is not enough to contain ISIS, we must defeat ISIS, break its momentum and then its back. And not just ISIS, but the broader radical jihadist movement that also includes al Qaeda and offshoots like al Shabaab in Somalia.\nNow, waging and winning this fight will require serious leadership. But unfortunately, our political debate has been anything but serious.\nWe can't afford another major ground war in the Middle East. That's exactly what ISIS wants from us. Shallow slogans don't add up to a strategy. Promising to carpet bomb until the desert glows doesn't make you sound strong, it makes you sound like you're in over your head. Bluster and bigotry are not credentials for becoming Commander-in-Chief.\nAnd it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations, including the top official at the Treasury Department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing.\nEvery day that's wasted on partisan gridlock could put Americans in danger. So, yes, we need a serious discussion. And that's why in a speech last month before the Council on Foreign Relations I laid out a three-part plan to defeat ISIS and the broader extremist movement.\nOne, defeat ISIS in the Middle East by smashing its stronghold, hitting its fighters, leaders, and infrastructure from the air, and intensifying support for local forces who can pursue them on the ground.\nSecond, defeat them around the world by dismantling the global network of terror that supplies radical jihadists with money, arms, propaganda, and fighters.\nAnd third, defeat them here at home by foiling plots, disrupting radicalization, and hardening our defenses.\nNow, these three lines of effort reinforce one another. So we need to pursue all of them at once, using every pillar of American power.\nIt will require skillful diplomacy to continue Secretary Kerry's efforts to encourage political reconciliation in Iraq and political transition in Syria, enabling more Sunni Arabs and Kurdish fighters to take on ISIS on both sides of the border, and to get our Arab and Turkish partners to actually step up and do their part.\nIt will require more U.S. and allied airpower, and a broader target set for strikes by planes and drones, with proper safeguards.\nIt will require Special Operations units to advise and train local forces and conduct key counterterrorism missions.\nWhat it will not require is tens of thousands of American combat troops. That is not the right action for us to take in this situation.\nSo there is a lot to do, and today, I want to focus on the third part of my plan, how we defend our country and prevent radicalization here at home.\nWe need a comprehensive strategy to counter each step in the process that can lead to an attack like the one in San Bernardino.\nFirst, we have to shut down ISIS recruitment in the United States, especially online.\nSecond, stop would-be jihadists from getting training overseas, and stop foreign terrorists from coming here.\nThird, discover and disrupt plots before they can be carried out.\nFourth, support law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to attacks.\nAnd fifth, empower our Muslim-American communities, who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization.\nThis is a 360-degree strategy to keep America safe, and I want to walk through each of the elements, from recruitment to training to planning to execution.\nFirst, shutting down recruitment. We have to stop jihadists from radicalizing new recruits in-person and through social media, chat rooms, and what's called the \"Dark Web.\"\nTo do that, we need stronger relationships between Washington, Silicon Valley, and all of our great tech companies and entrepreneurs. American innovation is a powerful force, and we have to put it to work defeating ISIS.\nThat starts with understanding where and how recruitment happens. Our security professionals need to more effectively track and analyze ISIS's social media posts and map jihadist networks, and they need help from the tech community.\nCompanies should redouble their efforts to maintain and enforce their own service agreements and other necessary policies to police their networks, identifying extremist content and removing it.\nNow, many are already doing this, and sharing those best practices more widely is important.\nAt the State Department, I started an interagency center to combat violent jihadist messages, to have a better way to communicate on behalf of our values, and to give young people drawn to those messages an alternative narrative.\nWe recruited specialists fluent in Arabic, Urdu, and Somali to wage online battles with extremists to counter their propaganda.\nNow, those efforts have not kept pace with the threat, so we need to step up our game, in partnership with the private sector and credible moderate voices outside government.\nBut that's just some of what we have to do. Experts from the FBI, the intelligence community, Homeland Security, DOD, the State Department, and the technology industry should work together to develop a unified national strategy to defeat ISIS in cyberspace, using all of our capabilities to deny jihadists virtual territory, just as we work to deny them actual territory.\nAnd at the same time, we also have to do more to address the challenge of radicalization, whatever form it takes.\nIt's imperative that the Saudis, the Qataris, the Kuwaitis and others stop their citizens from supporting radical schools, madrassas and mosques around the world, once and for all, and that should be the top priority in all of our discussions with these countries.\nNow, second, we have to prevent ISIS recruits from training abroad, and prevent foreign jihadists from coming here.\nMost urgent is stemming the flow of fighters from Europe and America to Iraq and Syria, and then back home again.\nThe United States and our allies need to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip, and then share information with each other in real time.\nRight now, European nations don't always alert each other when they turn away a suspected extremist at the border or when a passport is stolen. They have to dramatically improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism cooperation. And we're ready to help them do that.\nWe also need to take down the network of enablers who help jihadists finance and facilitate their travel, forge documents, and evade detection. And the United States and our allies should commit to revoke the passports and visas of jihadists who have gone to join ISIS or other groups, and bring the full force of law against them.\nAs I've said before, the United States has to take a close look at our visa programs. And I am glad the administration and Congress are stepping up scrutiny in the wake of San Bernardino. And that should include scrutinizing applicants' social media postings. We also should dispatch more Homeland Security agents to high-risk countries to better investigate visa applicants.\nFor many years, America has waived visa requirements for travelers from countries with reliable security procedures, including key allies in Europe and Asia. That makes sense. But we also have to be smart. Except for limited exceptions like diplomats and aid workers, anyone who has traveled in the past five years to a country facing serious problems with terrorism and foreign fighters should have to go through a full visa investigation, no matter where they're from.\nWe also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals. Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it's a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months.\nBut Congress needs to provide enough resources to ensure we have sufficient personnel deployed to run the most thorough possible process.\nAnd just as important, we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations.\nTurning away orphans, applying a religious test that discriminates against Muslims, slamming the door on every single Syrian refugee; that is not who we are. We are better than that.\nIt would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones. \u00a0So after rigorous screening, we should welcome families fleeing Syria just as the Twin Cities and this state have welcomed previous generations of refugees, exiles, and immigrants.\nOf course, the key is to prevent terrorists also from exploiting our compassion and endangering our security. But we can do this. And I think we must.\nThird, we have to discover and disrupt jihadist plots before they can be carried out. This is going to take better intelligence collection, analysis, and sharing. I've proposed an \"intelligence surge\" against ISIS that includes more operations officers and linguists, enhancing our technical surveillance of overseas targets, intercepting terrorist communications, flying more reconnaissance missions to track terrorists' movements, and developing even closer partnerships with other intelligence services.\nPresident Obama recently signed the USA Freedom Act, which was passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress. It protects civil liberties while maintaining capabilities that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to keep us safe. However, the new law is now under attack from presidential candidates on the left and right. Some would strip away crucial counterterrorism tools, even with appropriate judicial and congressional oversight. Others seem eager to go back to discredited practices of the past.\nI don't think we can afford to let either view prevail. Now, encryption of mobile devices and communications does present a particularly tough problem with important implications for security and civil liberties. Law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals warn that impenetrable encryption may make it harder for them to investigate plots and prevent future attacks. On the other hand, there are very legitimate worries about privacy, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit.\nI know there's no magic fix to this dilemma that will satisfy all these concerns. But we can't just throw up our hands. The tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to keep us safe from terrorists.\u00a0 And even as we make sure law enforcement officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks, it's essential that we also make sure jihadists don't get the tools they need to carry out attacks.\nIt defies common sense that Republicans in Congress refuse to make it harder for potential terrorists to buy guns. If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun, period.\u00a0 And we should insist on comprehensive background checks and close loopholes that allow potential terrorists to buy weapons online or at gun shows. And I think it's time to restore the ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines.\nI know this will drive some of our Republican friends a little crazy. You'll probably hear it tonight. They will say that guns are a totally separate issue, nothing to do with terrorism. Well, I have news for them, terrorists use guns to kill Americans. And I think we should make it a lot harder for them from to do that ever again.\nAnd there's a question, a question they should be asked: Why don't the Republican candidates want to do that? \u00a0\u00a0You see, I have this old fashioned idea that we elect a President in part, in large part, to keep us safe, from terrorists, from gun violence, from whatever threatens our families and communities. And I'm not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that's not the right path for us to go down.\nNow, the fourth element in my strategy is supporting law enforcement officers who risk their lives to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.\nIn San Bernardino, city, county, state, and federal authorities acted with speed and courage to prevent even more loss of life. Like Detective Jorge Lozano, a 15-year police veteran, who assured terrified civilians, \"I'll take a bullet before you do.\" There is no limit to the gratitude we owe to law enforcement professionals like that Detective Lozano who run toward danger to try to save lives. And not just in the immediate wake of an attack. Our police, firefighters, and emergency responders will keep putting their lives on the line long after the cameras move on.\nIt's disgraceful that Congress has thus far failed to keep faith with first responders suffering from the lasting health effects of 9\/11. Many of them were men and women I was so proud to represent as a Senator from New York. The Zadroga 9\/11 Health Act never should have been allowed to lapse. It looks like Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may have finally dropped his opposition. And I hope the American people will hold him to that. And we will continue to honor the service and sacrifice of those who responded to the worst terrorist attack in our history.\nWe have to make sure that local law enforcement has the resources and training they need to keep us safe. And they should be more closely synced up with national counterterrorism experts, including with better use of \"fusion centers\" that serve as clearinghouses for intelligence and coordination.\nAnd we need to strengthen our defenses and our resilience wherever we're vulnerable, whether it's \"soft targets\" like shopping malls or higher-profile targets like airports, railways, or power plants. We have to build on the progress of the Obama Administration in locking down loose nuclear materials, and other WMD, so they never fall into the hands of terrorists who seek them actively around the world.\nSo we should be providing the Department of Homeland Security with the resources it needs to stay one step ahead, not trying to privatize key functions, like TSA, as some Republicans have proposed.\nAnd it's important for us to recognize that when we talk about law enforcement, we have made progress in being sure that our federal authorities share information with our state and local authorities, but that was an issue I tackled after 9\/11, and we have to stay really vigilant so that information is in the hands where it needs to be.\nFinally, the fifth element in the strategy is empowering Muslim-American communities who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization. There are millions of peace-loving Muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in our country. These Americans may be our first, last, and best defense against home grown radicalization and terrorism. They are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it's too late, intervene to help set a young person straight. They are the best positioned to block anything going forward.\nThat's why law enforcement has worked so hard since 9\/11 to build up trust and strong relationships within Muslim-American communities. \u00a0Here in the Twin Cities, you have an innovative partnership that brings together parents, teachers, imams, and others in the Somali-American community with law enforcement, non-profits, local businesses, mental health professionals and others to intervene with young people who are at risk.\nIt's called the Building Community Resilience Pilot Program, and it deserves increased support. It has not gotten the financial resources that it needs to do everything the people involved in it know they can do. And we've got to do a better job of supporting it.\nNow I know that like many places across the country, there's more work to do to increase trust between communities and law enforcement. Just last month, I know here a young African American man was fatally shot by a police officer. And I understand an investigation is underway. Whatever the outcome, tragedies like this raise hard questions about racial justice in America and put at risk efforts to build the community relationships that help keep us safe from crime and from terrorism.\nWhen people see that respect and trust are two-way streets, they're more likely to work hand-in-hand with law enforcement. One of the mothers of the 10 men recently charged with conspiring with terrorists said, \"We have to stop the denial,\" she told other parents that. \"We have to talk to our kids and work with the FBI.\" That's a message we need to hear from leaders within Muslim-American communities across our country.\nBut we also want to highlight the successes in Muslim American communities, and there are so many of them. I just met with the first Somali-American council member of the City Council here. And he was proudly telling me how much change Somali immigrants, now Muslim-Americans have made in parts of the city and neighborhoods that had been pretty much hollowed out. Let's look at the successes.\nIf we're going to full integrate everyone into America, then we need to be seeing all their contributions, too. And that is one of the many reasons why we must all stand up against offensive, inflammatory, hateful, anti-Muslim rhetoric. You know, not only do these comments cut against everything we stand for as Americans, they are also dangerous.\nAs the Director of the FBI told Congress recently, anything that erodes trust with Muslim-Americans makes the job of law enforcement more difficult. We need every community invested in this fight, not alienated and sitting on the sidelines.\nOne of the community leaders I met with told me that a lot of the children in the community are now afraid to go to school. They're not only afraid of being perceived as a threat, they are afraid of being threatened because of who they are. This is such a open-hearted and generous community, I hope there will be even more efforts perhaps under the aegis of the university and certainly Governor Dayton and others, to bring people together to reassure members of the community, particularly children and teenagers that they are welcome, invited and valued here in this city and state.\nNow Donald Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States has rightly sparked outrage across our country and around the world. Even some of the other Republican candidates are saying he's gone too far. But the truth is, many of those same candidates have also said disgraceful things about Muslims. And this kind of divisive rhetoric actually plays into the hands of terrorists. It alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in the fight against ISIS.\nYou know, you hear a lot of talk from some of the other candidates about coalitions. Everyone seems to want one. But there's not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to build a coalition and make it work. I know how hard this is because I've done it. And I can tell you, insulting potential allies doesn't make it any easier.\nAnd demonizing Muslims also feeds a narrative that jihadists use to recruit new followers around the world, that the United States is at war with Islam. As both the Pentagon and the FBI have said in the past week, we cannot in any way lend credence to that twisted idea. This is not a clash of civilizations. It's a clash between civilization and barbarism and that's how it must be seen and fought.\nSome will tell you that our open society is a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism. I disagree. I believe our tolerance and diversity are at the core of our strength. At a Naturalization ceremony for new citizens today in Washington, President Obama noted the tension throughout our history between welcoming or rejecting the stranger. It is, he said, about the meaning of America, what kind of country do we want to be? And it's about the capacity of each generation to honor the creed as old as our founding, E Pluribus Unum. Out of many we are one.\nPresident Obama is right, and it matters. It's no coincidence that American Muslims have long been better integrated and less susceptible to radicalization than Muslims in less welcoming countries. \u00a0We can't give in to demagogues who play on our basest instincts. We must instead rely on the principles written into our American DNA. Freedom. Equality. Opportunity.\nAmerica is strongest when all our people believe they have a stake in our country and our future, no matter where they're from, what they look like, how they worship, or who they love. \u00a0Our country was founded by people fleeing religious persecution. As George Washington put it, the United States gives \"to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\" So to all our Muslim-American brothers and sisters, this is your country too. And I am proud to be your fellow American.\nAnd I want to remind us, particularly our Republican friends, that George W. Bush was right. Six days after 9\/11 he went to a Muslim community center and here's what he said, those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take their anger don't represent the best of America, they represent the worst of human kind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.\nSo if you want to see the best of America, you need look no further than Army Captain Humayun Khan. He was born in the United Arab Emirates. He moved to Maryland as a small child, and later graduated from the University of Virginia, before enlisting in the U.S. Army.\nIn June 2004, he was serving in Iraq. One day, while his infantry unit was guarding the gates of their base, a suspicious vehicle appeared. Captain Khan told his troops to get back, but he went forward. He took ten steps toward the car before it exploded. Captain Khan was killed, but his unit was saved by his courageous acts. Captain Khan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He was just 27 years old.\n\"We still wonder what made him take those 10 steps,\" Khan's father said in a recent interview.\n\"Maybe that's the point,\" he went on, \"where all the values, all the service to country, all the things he learned in this country kicked in. It was those values that made him take those 10 steps. Those 10 steps told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country,\" his father finished.\nAs hard as this is, it's time to move from fear to resolve. It's time to stand up and say,\n\"We are Americans.\" We are the greatest nation on earth not in spite of the challenges we've faced, but because of them. \u00a0Americans will not buckle or break. \u00a0We will not turn on each other or turn on our principles. We will pursue our enemies with unyielding power and purpose. We will crush their would-be caliphate and counter radical jihadism wherever it takes root. \u00a0We're in it for the long haul. And we'll stand taller and stronger than they can possibly imagine.\nThat's what we do here. It's who we are. That's how we'll win, by looking at one another with respect, with concern, with commitment. That's the America that I know makes us all so proud to be a part of.\nThank you all very much.\n","2":"\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And we'll hear more on that from the president tonight. Let's get more on it now from Secretary Hillary Clinton, back on THIS WEEK for the first time this presidential campaign.\nAnd a reminder for everyone watching, I worked for President Clinton, made charitable contributions in the past to the Clinton Foundation.\nWelcome back.\nCLINTON: Thanks, George.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Is it time to declare war on ISIS?\nCLINTON: Look, we are definitely in conflict with ISIS and I think we need a new update of military authorization. The AUMF, which was passed after the attack on 9\/11, should be brought up to...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Why not declare war?\nCLINTON: Well, declare war is a very legal term, as you know so well. I think what we want to do is make sure we have every tool at our disposal to, number one, destroy there would-be caliphate in Syria and in Ra\u2014in Iraq.\nNumber two, do everything we can to dismantle this very effective virtual jihadist network that they are using on the Internet.\nAnd number three, do whatever is necessary to protect us here at home.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What are you concerned about in the declaration of war?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that the legal experts say that if we\u2014there are a lot who say that we already have the authority we need to go after ISIS or any international terrorist network, including al Qaeda and anybody else in the AUMF.\nI think it is important, though, for the Congress to vote on behalf of the American people and to make sure that we are updating it to take into account the new authorities that that risks.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You put\u2014you've also been reluctant to say we're fighting radical Islam. And I wonder why not.\nIsn't it a mistake not to say it plain, that the violence is being pushed by radical elements in that faith?\nCLINTON: Well, that's a different thing. Radical elements who use a dangerous and distorted view of Islam to promote their jihadist ambitions, I'm fine with that. I say it all the time and I go after Islamic, too.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So what's the problem with radical Islam?\nCLINTON: Well, the problem is that that sounds like we are declaring war against a religion. And that, to me, is, number one, wrong but...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Even though the qualifier radical is there?\nCLINTON: No, because, look, that\u2014you know enough about religion, you've studied it. And there are radicals, people who believe all kinds of things in every religion in the world.\nI don't want to do that because, number one, it doesn't do justice to the vast numbers of Muslims in our own country and around the world who are peaceful people.\nNumber two, it helps to create this clash of civilizations that is actually a recruiting tool for ISIS and other radical jihadists who use this as a way of saying we're in a war against the West. You must join us. If you are a Muslim, you must join us.\nNo. If you're a law-abiding, peace-loving Muslim, you need to be with us against those who are distorting Islam.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Can you say today that we're winning the fight against ISIS?\nCLINTON: I could say today that we have a new set of threats. You know, if\u2014if you go back and look where we were with al Qaeda in 9\/11, there's no doubt bin Laden and his lieutenants were planning to carry out additional attacks, if they possibly could. And they did in places like Madrid and London, etc.\nSo we have dealt with that threat. It doesn't go away. We haven't eliminated it, but we've dealt with it.\nNow, we have to turn our attention to the very sophisticated propagation of this new threat from ISIS.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So we're not winning that battle yet?\nCLINTON: Well, we're not winning but it's too soon to say that we are doing everything we need to do. And I've outlined very clearly\u2014\nSTEPHANOPOULOS:\u2014so if you\u2014\nCLINTON:\u2014we have to fight them in the air. We have to fight them on ground and we have to fight on the Internet. And we have to do everything we can with our friends and partners around the world to protect ourselves.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: If you were in the Oval Office tonight, would you be announcing a new strategy?\nCLINTON: Well, I think what\u2014that's what we'll hear from the president, an intensification of the existing strategy and I think there's some additional steps we have to take.\nIf you look at the story about this woman and maybe the man, too, who got radicalized, self-radicalized, we're going to need help from Facebook and from YouTube and from Twitter. They cannot permit the recruitment and the actual direction of attacks or the celebration of violence by this sophisticated Internet user.\nThey're going to have to help us take down these announcements and these appeals\u2014[crosstalk]\u2014they get up.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How about Apple? No more encryption?\nCLINTON: This is something I've said for a long time, George. I have to believe that the best minds in the private sector, in the public sector could come together to help us deal with this evolving threat. And you know, I know what the argument is from our friends in the industry. I respect that. Nobody wants to be feeling like their privacy is invaded.\nBut I also know what the argument is on the other side from law enforcement and security professionals. So, please, let's get together and try to figure out the best way forward.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Some of your potential rivals on the Republican side say we have to do more overseas as well. Ted Cruz says we have to carpet bomb ISIS.\nCLINTON: Well, that's an easy thing to say, you know. He's never had any responsibility for trying to figure out who the bad guys are and who innocent civilians are. Clearly we have to have a much more robust air campaign against ISIS targets, against the oil infrastructure, against their leadership. I think you'll hear that from the president. And part of what I have been arguing for, for quite some time now, is that we've got to do a better job of getting back the Sunnis on the ground, along with the Kurds, who can be the fighters who will actually take back territory with air cover and with targeted attacks on ISIS infrastructure. We still are going to have to have people fighting.\nNow I do not believe those should be American combat troops\u2014[crosstalk]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely not; is that an absolute\u2014\nCLINTON: Where I sit right now, I think it would make things worse not better; I do believe we have to up our special ops numbers. The 50 that have been authorized need to get there. And then we need to take stock of what else we need. I think the more than 3,000 Americans that we have on the ground in Iraq, who are advising, assisting and enabling the Iraqi military have to be given the flexibility and support they need.\nAnd I believe strongly we should perhaps ask some of our current and retired military officers, who dealt with the Sunni sheikhs in Anbar and elsewhere to once again reconstitute the fighting force that they put into the fight against Al Qaeda in Iraq.\nAnd that was one of my biggest complaints about Maliki, because what he did was to basically not only destroy the military because of his sectarianism but also he went after those Sunni leaders in Anbar and we know from reporting that some of them are supportive of ISIS, some of the former Ba'ath military officers under Saddam Hussein.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, some of your Republican rivals have also criticized you for focusing on gun control after the San Bernardino attacks. Marco Rubio points out that France has some of the strictest gun control in the world. That didn't stop the Paris attacks.\nCalifornia has some of the strictest gun control laws here. It didn't stop those attacks, either.\nSo what law would have stopped this?\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, what happened in San Bernardino was a terrorist act. Nobody is arguing with that. The law enforcement, FBI have come to that conclusion. And let's not forget, though, a week before we had an American assault on Planned Parenthood and some weeks before that we had an assault at a community college.\nSo I don't see these two as in anyway contradictory. We have to up our game against terrorists abroad and at home and we have to take account of the fact that our gun laws and the easy access to those guns by people who shouldn't get them, mentally ill people, fugitives, felons and the Congress continuing to refuse to prohibit people on the no-fly list from getting guns, which include a lot of domestic and international terrorists, these are two parts of the same approach that I'm taking to make us safe.\nAnd, yes, the NRA's position always is, you know, if you can't stop everything, why try to stop anything? That's not the way law works. I mean, we have laws that are going to govern our speed limits on roads, knowing some people are going to violate it or people are going to drive drunk. But we still have laws. We need to have comprehensive background checks. We need to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole, go after what's call the Charleston loophole and end the liability for gun sellers.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: On this no-fly list, the critics of that vote say that you know, you look back at this; it's indiscriminate and they go back 10 years and say 2,000 people on the watch list actually did buy guns; government hasn't found any of them committing a crime with a gun.\nCLINTON: Well, again, that's like proving the negative. We have a list; if you are on that list and you believe you should not be on that list, we have a process to actually raise your objections about being on that list.\nYou get on the list because there is some credible evidence you belong on the list. Now obviously, that\u2014\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Some mistakes sometimes.\nCLINTON:\u2014some mistakes, of course. That's why there's a process for people to be able to raise their concerns about being on the list and then to have a process that could even lead to a legal action to remove yourself from the list.\nBut I, for one, am a lot\u2014I took the shuttle from New York. I'm a lot happier having a list that keeps people off planes that there's any question about their intent or their potential behavior.\nSo I'm not\u2014I can't take anybody seriously who's going to begin to chip away at the no-fly list.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump and yesterday Jerry Falwell Jr. say the answer is for more good people to have guns. Mr. Falwell urged his students at Liberty University to actually arm themselves, get concealed carry permits.\nYour response?\nCLINTON: Well, he also went on\u2014and don't forget he said this, George. He said, that way, we can take out the Muslims.\nHe said that, OK?\nThis is the kind of deplorable, not only hateful response to a legitimate security issue but it is giving aid and comfort to ISIS and other radical jihadists.\nWith respect to the gun issue, it' s legal to buy guns in America if you are eligible to buy a gun, you can go buy a gun and hundreds of thousands of people apparently are in the aftermath of what happened in San Bernardino.\nI just want people to understand some of the threats we now face, whether it's the guy in Charleston, who should have never have been given a gun but the universal background check was not fast enough, didn't find the fact he was prohibited, went into the church and killed nine innocent people, we should be able to approach both of these with some sense of, you know, unity about how we prevent terrorist attacks and how we prevent the wrong people from getting a hold of guns.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We have to take a quick break. Stand by. Much more from Secretary Clinton later. Another live exclusive, one of the men by the taker on from a Florida governor, Jeb Bush.\n[commercial break]\n[begin video clip]\nJEB BUSH: I think you're looking at the next Republican nominee. And here's\u2014and here's what I promised to you, should I win this nomination I will take it to Hillary Clinton and I will whoop her.\n[end video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Jeb Bush there. Hillary Clinton here right now.\nAnd as he's hoping, he's going to come up live in just a little bit hoping to take you on in the general election if you get the nomination.\nI want to get into some of the issues that may come up in a general election. One of the things you're seeing Republicans really take aim at is your spending and investment programs.\nCLINTON: Right.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: On the show right here, proposed about $1 trillion...\nCLINTON: Over 10 years.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Over 10 years in spending proposals that a lot of questions on whether you can actually pay for it by focusing tax increases only on the top 3 percent. Here's a Washington Post editorial. They say there is simply no way that the federal government can meet its current fiscal commitments plus the increased demands of an aging population and provide the new forms of middle class relief and business tax relief Mrs. Clinton promises while tapping only the top 3 percent of earners. Your response?\nCLINTON: Well, I just respectfully disagree. And that's why I've laid out very specific plans about the kind of investments that I think Middle Class families particularly need that we have to have to, you know, grow our economy. And I've been very specific about how I will pay for each of those. And that is part of the, you know, underlying principle of presenting the...[crosstalk]\nBut I think it's a little bit amusing that the Republican National Committee would go after me, since all of their candidates and their party philosophy is massive spending cuts and massive tax decreases for those at the very top with no thought to how to pay for it or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national debt, you know.\nI do come from the Clinton school of economics. And when my husband ended, we had a balanced budget and a surplus. Then President Obama inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out.\nSo, we're standing. And now we've got to start moving into the future again. It is going to take good fiscal responsibility, that's what I'm promising. But I'm also promising that the wealthy are going to start paying more of their fair share and help to fund some of the investments that I'm paying for.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: They're also saying no tax increases at all anyone earning under $250,000. Is that a rock solid \"read my lips\" promise?\nCLINTON: Well, it certainly is my goal. And I've laid it out in this campaign. And it's something that President Obama promised. It's something my husband certainly tried to achieve, because I want Americans to know that I get it, that a lot of the losses that they experienced because of the great recession are still really pulling them down.\nYou know, $13 trillion in family wealth was destroyed by the great recession. People lost their homes, their 401(k)s and IRAs, their college funds. So, we've got to rebuild the middle class. If we expect to have broad based prosperity, that doesn't come from...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, it's your goal, but what if you can't get the revenue in other ways. What if the spending comes in more than it is. Will you then raise taxes?\nCLINTON: You know, George, I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. And I'm going to continue to stick with what I'm going to do. $100 billion a year in these new investments all paid for I think is a responsible approach to getting our economy creating good jobs again.\nYou know, I have an infrastructure plan that's on top of what the congress just passed.\nSo, I'm going to go out there and I'm going to defend what I'm doing. And I'm also really going to defend the Middle Class, because a lot of these proposals would have a very bad effect. Either it would raise taxes on the Middle Class or it would undermine the kind of growth and structure that we need for the Middle Class to take off again.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Another challenge you could face in this campaign, a majority of Americans question your honesty. Some GOP rivals and family members of the Benghazi victims are saying you lied to them in that hearing.\nThey point to emails that you sent the night of the attack, one to your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, saying\u2014I'm going to have to put my glasses on here to actually read this. \"We were silent...two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group.\" Another one to the Egyptian prime minister, \"we know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.\"\nBut the family members, as you know, say you told them it was by a filmmaker, you'd go after the filmmaker. Here's what they said.\n[begin video clip]\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She lied. She absolutely lied. Her daughter was able to be told differently that it was not the video, it was something else. Now if her daughter could be told, why can't I?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Either she was lying to the prime minister, or she was lying to me and to the American public. [end video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell them it was not the film? And what's your response?\nCLINTON: No.\nYou know, look I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions.\nNow, I can't\u2014I can't help it the people think there has to be something else there. I said very clearly there had been a terrorist group that had taken responsibility on Facebook between the time that I\u2014you know, when I talked to my daughter, that was the latest information. We were giving it credibility. And then we learned the next day it wasn't true. In fact, they retracted it.\nThis was a fast moving series of events in the fog of war. And I think most Americans understand.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How about more generally. Do you think there's something you can do to get a majority of Americans to believe you're trustworthy?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, obviously I don't like hearing that, George. But I think people who have worked with me, people who voted for me twice in New York, people who I've had a very long relationship with and working on their behalf are going to know what I do and when I say I will do it I will move everything I can to get it done.\nAnd I believe the American people who are looking for somebody who is a fighter, who will stand up there, just as I did, tell you what I will do, tell you I will do everything to make it happen. And I think my values have been consistent over the years. And the results that I've gotten are ones that I'm going to take to the American public.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Immigration going to be a big issue in this campaign?\nIn the past, you've said that undocumented immigrants would not be covered by your health care proposals. Here's an exchange we had in 2007.\n[begin video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Would illegal immigrants be covered under your plan?\nCLINTON: Illegal immigrants would not be covered. No. They would not be covered. I will continue to have a safety net, which I think is in the best traditions of our country and also for public health reasons absolutely necessary.\nBut we did not cover them in '93, '94 and my plan does not cover them now.\n[end video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Now you say that undocumented immigrants should be able to buy into the exchanges. So why the shift?\nCLINTON: Well, because number one the kind of plan that was passed in the Affordable Care Act gives you a market-based way of getting into the insurance market. So, if you can afford to buy a policy, you can. You don't get, however, any of the subsidies that American citizens get.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Martin O'Malley says they should. Why not?\nCLINTON: Well, I disagree with him. I think part of comprehensive immigration reform should be looking at all of these issues. But as things stand right now, under the Affordable Care Act, if you have the money and you are undocumented, you can buy into it, but without the subsidies. That's why it's important we continue to support community health centers, we continue to support our hospitals because those are often the places that undocumented people and poor people go.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And what's the reason for not going further?\nCLINTON: Because I don't think legally you can. I mean, that is not something that we can legally support. The law is very clear about that.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump. Last few days he's opened up\u2014you're laughing again.\nCLINTON: I'm sorry. I can't help it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He's opening up a new line of attack on you. Here it is.\nCLINTON: Oh, dear. A new one, huh?\n[begin video clip]\nTRUMP: She'll do a couple of minutes in Iowa, meaning a short period of time, and then she goes home and you don't see her for five, six days, she goes home, she goes to sleep. I'm telling you. She...[laughter]...she doesn't have the strength, she doesn't have the stamina.\n[end video clip]\nCLINTON: Oh, goodness gracious. [laughter] You know...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I guess you don't agree.\nCLINTON: Well, who can agree with anything he says that is, you know, subject to one second of fact checking?\nLook, if he gets the nomination, I will be more than happy to campaign against him.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Is he the one you want to run against?\nCLINTON: I don't really think about it that way. I don't have any influence over who they nominate over there and, in fact, he's not the only one saying things that are deeply distressing. A lot of the others are kind of Trump 2, you know?\nOh, whatever Trump says, maybe we won't go quite as far, but we'll get as close as we can.\nSo the Republicans, in their presidential nominating process, have a lot to answer for.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How do you explain why he's doing so well?\nCLINTON: I don't know, because he's a\u2014he's a reality TV star. I mean tens of millions of people have watched him for more than a decade on TV and he is part of the celebrity and he will stay whatever he wants to say and if he's held account, that\u2014it's not true, he just brushes it off and he goes on. And I think that, you know, there's a certain attractiveness to people that here's a guy who says exactly what he believes, untrue as it may be, inflammatory as it certainly is.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, you said you're getting better at learning from your critics. They tell you things that your friends won't.\nSo what have you learned from your critics in this campaign?\nCLINTON: You know, I've said for a long time, George, that I try\u2014I try to take criticism seriously but not personally. And by that I mean, look, if somebody says, hey, you know, you didn't do\u2014or she didn't do a good job answering this or, you know, I don't think that that, you know, adds up, whatever they might say, I will take that seriously.\nBut I really try not to take it personally and I think that's a big distinction that you have to begin to draw when you're in the public arena. You know, one of my favorite Americans, Eleanor Roosevelt, said for any woman in the public arena, you have to grow skin as thick as a rhinoceros and, you know, I try to put lotion on it, but I have...[laughter]...I've had to grow a lot of thick skin over the years.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks for joining us today.\nCLINTON: Thanks, George.\n","3":"\nROSE: She is a former first lady, a former senator from New York and a former United States secretary of state. Now Hillary Clinton is running for president. The Democratic frontrunner sat down with me for a wide-ranging conversation at the Hay Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. She talked about her plans to fight ISIS and remove Syria's Bashar al-Assad, the challenges of dealing with Russia, with China and with the problem of climate change and this\u2014the role of the United States in a rapidly changing world.\nFrom a balcony overlooking the White House, she told me how she hoped fix the dysfunction in Washington and what being president is all about.\nROSE: There is the seat of power in America, the White House\u2014Pennsylvania Avenue down the road. They seem to be in conflict. There seems to be gridlock. Can Hillary Clinton make a difference? Because Barack Obama thought he could.\nCLINTON: Right. Right.\nROSE: And he didn't.\nCLINTON: Well\u2014\nROSE: I know. It's not personal with him.\nCLINTON: Yes. Right no because\u2014\nROSE: Because it takes two to tango.\nCLINTON: He got a lot done, too, despite. Look\u2014\nROSE: How is he going to do it, though? People want to say to you, how can you stop this conflict?\nCLINTON: I'm going to get up every day and work at it.\nROSE: That's not enough.\nCLINTON: No, it is true.\nROSE: It's not enough.\nCLINTON: It starts with that\u2014Charlie.\nROSE: OK.\nCLINTON: It starts with that and it starts with once again, sort of nurturing relationships. You know, when I was first lady, when I was a senator and when I was secretary of state, I worked across the aisle all the time and sometimes there was only one thing that I could find to work with somebody on because everything else we were at odds over.\nROSE: So you say to those Republicans and you say to the new Speaker of the House\u2014\nCLINTON: Right.\nROSE:?\u2014Hillary Clinton will be somebody you can deal with?\nCLINTON: 100 percent.\nROSE: I'm prepared to reach out to you, I'll be down there.\nCLINTON: Yes. Right. And I will do anything to find common ground but I will also stand my ground. There are some things that are not good for the country. I will not give in on those, but there is a lot of room here to find that common ground and we have to do it.\nROSE: Yes. But you know a lot of people think the biggest problem for America is Washington. That's the problem. And that's partly reflected in some of the politics that we're seeing.\nCLINTON: Yes, that's true. But look at the way our founders set it up. They set up the separation of powers\u2014\nROSE: Three branches of government.\nCLINTON: And they made it really difficult to get things done, and some years it's really hard, and we're in one of these periods where we have a minority within the other party that doesn't believe in compromise, doesn't believe in reaching consensus\u2014\nROSE: But there you go attacking them. That's not the way to do it.\nCLINTON: No, no. No\u2014because part of what you have to do is make it clear to everyone else who is in that party that there is room for negotiation. And those who do not even believe in the legislative process because they think that they arrived with all the answers and there is nothing that they can learn, maybe there is some ground.\nI worked with Tom DeLay for heaven's sakes on reforming the adoption and foster care system because even though he and I were politically opposites, he cared a lot about foster kids and he and his wife had taken them in. I knew that. I cared about them. So we found that common ground.\nThat is just a 24\/7 effort and I will put whatever it takes into doing it.\nROSE: Waiting for the plane to come down from New York, a very nice lady said to me, where are you going? I said, I'm going to talk to Hillary Clinton. She said ask her this one question for me. What can I do to make a difference? That was what she said.\nCLINTON: That's a great question.\nROSE: And you must be finding that as you go.\nCLINTON: I do.\nROSE: I would think running for president, and you've done this before. As tough as it is, as sleepless as it is, you get a sense to touch base with the width and breadth of this country. And you get a sense from young to old, you know, how they aspire for a better life.\nCLINTON: Right. And, you know, there is something so intimate and personal about the encounters you have when you're running for office. I did when I was running for the Senate. I do now running for president. Sometimes just 30, 60 seconds people will look into your eyes and they'll say, \"I need help\", you know. \"My son is a drug addict and I'm taking care of his daughter, we have to have more help.'\nOr the young man I meet who says \"I'm taking care of my mother with Alzheimer's. I can't quit my job but I can't afford a caregiver so I take her to work.\" And I hear these intimate, personal stories. And it gives, you know, not only real texture to what I'm thinking about and what I'm proposing, but it makes it all real, you know, that there are real people out there doing the best they can.\nAnd what can she do? Well, maybe there is somebody she can help, you know. Maybe there is a child she can tutor. Maybe there's a project to raise funds to send kids to college. Maybe there is just something she can do to contribute to the life that will be better for somebody else.\nI say in my speeches, and I know it sometimes sounds a little corny, I say, you know, you don't expect the presidential candidate to say we need more love and kindness in America, but I'm saying it because I believe it. We've got to stop demonizing each other. We've got to stop with all of the anger and the terrible sense of alienation and division that is stalking our country.\nWe need to be kinder to one another. We need to put ourselves in each other's shoes and walk in them, if you can. So, yes, I mean being president is running the executive branch, doing foreign policy, working with the Congress, but it's also being a catalyst for people to feel that they can be their best selves and that we need them\u2014\nROSE: And we're in this together.\nCLINTON:?\u2014and that's what I want to do. We're in this together. Absolutely.\n[ROSE: This was the first major interview Secretary Clinton has granted since the terror attacks in Paris. We began our conversation with that tragedy and with her strategy to defeat the terror group ISIS.]\nROSE: Thank you for doing this. It's so great to see you.\nCLINTON: Great to see you. Thanks\u2014Charlie.\nROSE: This is the first conversation interview you've had since Paris. What's new? What did Paris change for all of us?\nCLINTON: I think it forced a conversation that is taking place not only in our country and in Europe but in many places across the world about what are the opportunities and the dangers in this very complex time that we're living in. and specifically with respect to ISIS I think it has really accelerated a discussion about thousand world is going to deal with not only ISIS\u2014how to deny it territory\u2014but also with the whole network radical Jihadism which has taken advantage of that arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia.\nAnd then I think finally how are we going to protect ourselves, our friends, our partners in a way that is in keeping with our openness, our values? And so I think it's really pushed all of these discussions that you have in the situation room, that you have in lots of places; but now it's pushed into the open and it's a matter of personal and political debate.\nROSE: OK. So with respect to the new urgency, what should the United States do and what would you recommend we do?\nCLINTON: Well, I gave a speech about this.\nROSE: You did it at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nCLINTON: Council on Foreign Relations because I think it's important that we look at it from a broader perspective. Number one, we have to deny them territory with a multi-pronged, multi-national effort, and the United States must lead that effort.\nROSE: What does that mean\u2014lead?\nCLINTON: Well, what it means is that we have to do the heavy lifting to get people to make the contributions that they have to make, whether it be aircraft to fly airstrikes against ISIS territory to go after leadership and economic infrastructure. Or putting together the troops on the ground, how we get more equipment and support to the Kurds who have been bearing the brunt of the fighting; how we do everything we can to get the Iraqis not only stand up their army but begin to work with the Sunni tribal leaders as was done successfully back in '07.\nROSE: And what incentive would you offer to the Sunni leaders to get them engaged on the ground so with the addition of American airstrikes you might wage an effective campaign both in Iraq and Syria?\nCLINTON: Well nothing beats what was tried last time which was cash. Let's not turn our nose up at it.\nROSE: That's General Petraeus.\nCLINTON: That's General Petraeus whom you recently talked with and was very straightforward and said, \"Look, we basically paid the tribal sheiks in Anbar\" and now we would probably continue that across the border into Syria to pull together a fighting force, and it works. And it worked, in part, because of revulsion against the predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, the treatment of everybody at their hands, but it also worked because they were promised that they would have the autonomy and authority to make a lot of decisions within Iraq on their own behalf.\nAnd unfortunately, Maliki and his views toward sectarianism slowly but surely undermined all of that. And now you've got the Sunni sheiks, the fighters on the sidelines or, even worse, some of them making common cause with ISIS.\nROSE:?\u2014which raises an interesting question. Did we lose influence with the Baghdad government because we didn't have any remaining troops there? Would that have made a difference in terms of the behavior so that the Sunnis would not be so turned off by Baghdad?\nCLINTON: Well, I certainly thought we should keep troops there. I advocated for that. The real problem was Maliki. He would not give us what's called a status of forces agreement that would provide the protections for American troops that we have to expect anywhere in the world.\nAnd despite our best efforts, despite trying to negotiate and bargain with him, other members of his government, even the parliament, we were not able to reach that agreement. And the prior administration, the Bush administration had set a date certain for us to withdraw.\nSo in the absence of an agreement with Maliki, we had to withdraw. Now, that is what he wanted. I mean he made all kinds of promises to the administration which he did not fulfill.\nROSE: Was the absence of American troops, did it help lead to the strengthening of ISIS?\nCLINTON: I wouldn't go that far. I think it was the collapse of the internal agreements. Our understanding was that we had help them build up a force that would respect Sunnis, that they would have a place in the Iraqi army, that there was going to be a national guard that would be created, that would, in effect, protect the Sunnis and give them some sense of, you know, autonomy, enabling them to protect themselves. And then, of course, the Kurds, with their ongoing arguments with Baghdad over oil distribution and autonomy.\nSo what Maliki did, and he was the driving force, was to begin to purge the army of Sunni officers, begin to take a hard line against the Kurds and their desire for more autonomy. And so, I really place the blame, such as it can be placed, at Maliki's feet.\nROSE: What should be the limits of our involvement?\nCLINTON: Well, I think we have to look at this from several different perspectives. Number one, if we are going to lead a multi-national coalition, we're going to still have to take the lead in the air. That is our highest and best use. And even with France picking up at airstrikes, we're still, you know, carrying out the vast majority of them.\nWe also need to get those Special Forces that the President has authorized into the arena as soon as possible because they will be able to tell us what more is needed. And, in particular, how do we have better targeting on the ground. We want to go after the ISIS leadership, we want to go after their economic infrastructure\u2014how do we really know what we're targeting?\nROSE: But General Petraeus, as you mentioned the interview, said to me that we should be embedding at the battalion level and not just Special Forces.\nCLINTON: Well, we don't really have\u2014I couldn't tell whether he was meaning the Iraqi army, if we ever get it stood up again. That's something we could look at. We have over 3,000 American troops in Iraq trying to do just that, working to essentially undo the damage that Maliki did to the army, try to return it to what it was when American troops left.\nAnd I think that, you know, their main missions are train, assist and enable and if, down the road, it appears that we do get them up and willing to take the fight to Mosul and Ramadi and the areas that have to be taken back from ISIS inside Iraq, then there will be a role for Americans to perhaps be a part of advising those army units.\nWe're a long way from that. We don't\u2014and from what I'm told\u2014even yet have confidence that we could put them back into the fight. And at the same time, let's not forget what we were talking about earlier. We need to be building up a Sunni force, and that will have to operate on a parallel track to the army.\nROSE: But many people say we have been talking about this for a while, how do we get the Sunnis involved. There is a new urgency now\u2014\nCLINTON: Right.\nROSE:?\u2014and a new emergency now.\nCLINTON: Right.\nROSE: I mean tell me how serious the threat of ISIS is and at what level do we decide we'll do anything we have to do to stop them?\nCLINTON: I think we have to have as our objective their defeat, so what is it you have to do to defeat them? And I think you have to fight them in the air, you have to fight them on the ground and you have to fight them in cyberspace. Now it seems to me there are people both currently serving and retired like General Petraeus who know a lot of the players. And we should be utilizing anyone who has that kind of personal contact because it's all relationship based.\nWe need people to go over there and look into the eyes of some of those tribal sheiks who will say you betrayed us, and we'll say, no, we didn't. When we left we had promises about continuing to pay the Sunni troops and continuing to have an integrated army. And we had promises. They were systematically broken.\nSo let's do this again right. You stood against al Qaeda in Iraq because you saw the damage they were doing to your way of life, to your people\u2014the oppressive, violent approach that they took. Now you're facing an even more barbaric enemy which has more money and now controls territory. We need to get back in the game and we need to help you do that.\nROSE: Do we need to make coalition with Russia to do this?\nCLINTON: Well, I think we need, first of all, to build a coalition of Europeans and Arab states. We have to work with\u2014\nROSE: Don't we have that now?\nCLINTON: Well, we have it, but I would say\u2014\nROSE: And don't we see more participation by the British in terms of proposals to their parliament and the French are clearly energized.\nCLINTON: Well, the French are energized. The Brits are still waiting to see whether they can be. We do have a number of our European allies who are flying sorties. The Arabs have kind of pulled back and we need to get them reengaged.\nBut with respect to Russia, I am not yet sure what exactly Putin's objectives are. We know that he has been bombing a lot of the opposition to Assad. We have to operate on two tracks at one time in a lot of what we're doing, as I just was saying in another regard.\nWhen it comes to Russia, they have to understand that we are going to go forward with our multi-national, multi-pronged approach. I still believe a no-fly zone is important to try to provide some safe haven on the ground, taking back the Syrian-Turkish border is going to require Turkish help. It's going to require the Russians to be at least respectful of our efforts.\nSo we need to be engaged. We are engaged on a military to military\u2014\nROSE: There is some communication between\u2014\nCLINTON: Absolutely.\nROSE:?\u2014the defense minister and the secretary of defense.\nCLINTON: Yes. And we have de-conflicted the airspace that we both are in, so we are not making the mistakes. But what they did invading whether intentionally or unintentionally Turkish airspace after having been warned repeatedly by the Turks\u2014\nROSE: So what do you think?\nCLINTON: Well, what I think is that they did.\nROSE: They invaded on purpose?\nCLINTON: Well, no, I don't know\u2014I said intentionally or unintentionally. But they were on notice to stay back. You know it's not\u2014you can make a mistake, but they got so close that a mistake was possible or they just didn't care.\nROSE: so why did they do that? What is Putin trying to say to the world?\nCLINTON: Yes, well, I think this probably was not something that came down from the Kremlin. You know, they want to go after those forces that are threatening Assad, some of whom are near the Turkish border. But by invading the airspace\u2014and this is not the first time that they came close to doing it. NATO has issued a warning, the Turks have issued warnings.\nIt showed a disregard for the perspective of others, most particularly the Turks, that it's troubling. Now, I think they have been pushed back, and I think that we'll be able to have a more realistic conversation with them, which I would urge.\nROSE: But isn't Putin's interest pretty clear? He wants to be relevant. He wants to be a player. He wants to be part of the decision-making that takes place about Syria and he wants to say to the world Russia is important in the Middle East again\u2014\nCLINTON: Right.\nROSE:?\u2014and he's accomplished that.\nCLINTON: Well, he has certainly staked a claim to it. But whether he's accomplished or not is not clear. Because here's what also what has to happen\u2014another one of these dual tracks there, Charlie. We need to get over the false choice between either going after Assad or going after ISIS.\nROSE: Yes. Help us understand that because everybody is talking about that.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nROSE: How do you do both? Well, I think you do both by making it clear and bringing the Russians in. You know, The Russians have now paid a big price because of the bomb in their jet coming from Sharm el-Sheikh. So they've lost people to ISIS\u2014right.\nI think you say, look, we need, your if not your active help, your acquiescence in what we're going to do going after ISIS. So that means you're going to have to pull back from this area while we go after their leadership and their economic infrastructure.\nBut if you want to be part of that, we would welcome you. You have a dog in this hunt now because you're worried about what's happening in the Caucasus. You're worried about ISIS spreading its ideology.\nAt the same time we have to accelerate the political and diplomatic efforts and this is what Secretary Kerry is trying to do\u2014in Vienna and everywhere.\nCLINTON:?\u2014in Vienna and everywhere and there has to be more willingness on the part of Russia and Iran to take a hard look at how we prioritize. Right now we're not going to see a military defeat of Assad. That's not going to happen. It might have been possible a few years ago. It's not going to happen now.\nYou're going to continue to see Russia from the air, Iran from the ground where Iranian soldiers are dying on behalf of Assad. You're going to see them continue to try to hold the territory they have and push back against the opposition.\nSo part of what we have to do is say, look, you've got to help us get to a political and diplomatic solution and you've got to either get out of the way or come on board with respect to ISIS, and we have to be very clear about that. And this should be a full-throated effort.\nROSE: And you have to convince Assad, who's your client almost, that your time is limited.\nCLINTON: And that there will be a transition.\nROSE: Right.\nCLINTON: Now, knowing the Russians and the Iranians who have a lot invested in Assad, this is a long process. It's not going to won't happen overnight. But if they will in their own mind, say quit bombing the people who are helping us fight ISIS, go ahead and put a cordon around the area that Assad still controls, protect him there while we do the diplomatic and political work.\nROSE: Someone people would like to ask you this question. I mean we had the 3:00 phone call during a previous campaign\u2014what would you do. And so the question becomes, if there is a no-fly zone, which you're advocating, and the Russians invade that no-fly zone, would President Clinton say shoot it down if you give it warning?\nCLINTON: Charlie\u2014that would not happen because we're going to put up a no-fly zone where the Russians are clearly kept informed. I want them at the table. They don't have to participate in it but I want them to understand that there have to be safe areas on the ground.\nIf we can stop hundreds of thousands of more Syrians leaving Syria because they get to a place where they can get medical aid and food and the like, that's good for Russia. Why does Russia want this incredible burden that is going to be coming up through Europe and, yes, maybe they are happy to see Europe suffering like this but, in the end, it makes no sense for them and makes no sense for all of us.\nAnd so I think you've got to have that conversation. Look, it's never easy with the Russians and particularly hard with Putin, but if you say, as I think you should and as I think the conversation needs to get to an operational level. And then, at the same time, a conversation with Putin about what our options truly are, I think you can say to him, we're going to put up this no fly zone. You will know very well where it is because it's going to be the same people who are working now to de-conflict airspace\u2014\nROSE: Yes.\nCLINTON: The same Americans you're dealing with on a mill to mill level but we have got to figure out how to keep more Syrians in Syria and frankly it's good for the fight against ISIS if we've got population that then can be a locus for that.\nROSE: A no-fly zone is one way\u2014one place where you and the President disagree on policy with respect to Syria.\nCLINTON: Right.\nROSE: Are there others in which there is a difference? We saw what you said at the Council on Foreign Relations. We saw the interview he did in Turkey. You seemed to be similarly responding to what the situation is. Where else do you differ in addition to no-fly zones?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I think the President has said that perhaps we should have taken some additional steps earlier. But the real question is\u2014\nROSE: That goes back to the point when you and Petraeus and others were recommending more in 2011.\nCLINTON: Right, yes.\nBut now the important issue is what do we do now? And I think I'm arguing for perhaps a greater, quicker intensification of the work that I think needs to be done. I agree with the President's point that we're not putting American combat troops back into Syria or Iraq. We are not going to do that.\nROSE: Under no circumstances would you not do that?\nCLINTON: Well, at this point, I cannot conceive of any circumstances where I would agree to do that because I think the best way to defeat ISIS is, as I've said, from the air which we lead; on the ground which we enable, empower, train, equip; and in cyberspace where, don't forget, they are a formidable adversary online.\nSo what I want to say is, look, we don't know yet how many Special Forces might be needed, how many trainers and surveillance and enablers might be needed, but in terms of thousands of combat troops like some on the Republican side are recommending, I think that should be a non-starter.\nAnd it should be a non-starter both because I don't think it's the smartest way to go after ISIS. I think it gives ISIS a new recruitment tool if we get back in the fight. Whereas if we are equipping and supporting the Kurds, if we get the Sunni tribes back in the fight, then we can do a lot to make sure that works.\nROSE: Let me take you to another time\u2014Libya.\nYou were a strong if not the strongest proponent of the U.S. and the French and others going to protect Benghazi at a time that it faced almost certain attack by Gadhafi leading to, as he said, massacre in the streets.\nWas that a mistake when you look at what has happened since in Libya?\nCLINTON: First of all, it's important to remember that the Libyans themselves held two successful free and fair elections. You know how hard that is after conflict, after 42 years when every institution has been hollowed out? The Libyan people rose to the occasion. They voted for moderates. Then, unfortunately, there was a lot going on in the region that was not necessarily in the control of anybody but which had a big impact on Libya.\nROSE: So I have two questions about that. First question is I think you were going to\u2014I mean is there some lesson we need to learn and that may be applicable to Syria, don't get rid of a strong man until you have somebody that can come in there because you do not want chaos and you do not want the kind of circumstance in Libya because what you have in Libya now is an increasing force of ISIS.\nCLINTON: Well, in one part of Libya. Yes, let me address that because it's a totally fair question.\nGadhafi had American blood on his hands. Gadhafi was a threat to the broader region. Our European and Arab friends certainly saw him as that and as you say he was promising to track down his own people and kill them like cockroaches.\nMy point was that with his demise, there was a coalition that rose up. They did hold elections. They were prepared to begin forming a government and there was a lot of pressure coming at them from extremists in all directions. And some of the old attitudes like the split between Tripoli and Benghazi; between, you know, east and west began to assert themselves.\nI believe that right now there is an ongoing effort by the U.N. and others the U.S. is supporting to try to form a unity government, to try to get people once again to get back to working together. The problem, is we see advances by ISIS\u2014they're not the only terrorist group\u2014\nROSE: Sure.\nCLINTON:?\u2014but ISIS now claims that they have really taken control of Sirte, which happens to be Gadhafi's hometown. I think one of the ways we need to approach this is continue the discussions about national unity but, as a pre-condition, say we need to join together right now before they get a stronghold and work to eliminate ISIS in Sirte, and it is something that is going to require a lot of cooperation.\nThere are armed groups that are fighting for power within Libya that are not in any way identified with or allied with ISIS. They need to form even a loose confederation to try to push ISIS literally into the sea before they get a stronghold. There are a lot of other bad actors, don't get me wrong, bad actors who have taken up\u2014\nROSE: But could this also be part of the way the President thinks about things now? I mean we go in with great intentions, we help participate in the Arab Spring. It was their revolt, not ours. And we end up with where it's not successful, democracy does not emerge and you end up with, in some cases, failed states or states that seem to be on the verge of becoming failed states. And, so, it's just not a place for America to be.\nCLINTON: Again, I think it's dangerous to make these sweeping generalizations. Look at how valiantly the Tunisians are struggling.\nROSE: They're the big exception.\nCLINTON: They're the big exception because they're a relatively small country and they've worked really hard to get everybody under a tent, so to speak, and get them organized.\nLibya has pockets of functioning government, but they are not united, and it may well be very difficult to unite them because there has been historical rivalry between them. But we're talking about four years. You know we have a very quick time table\u2014\nROSE: I know. We didn't create democracy overnight.\nCLINTON: We did not, no. And nobody that I know relay has. That's not to say there is not dangers. And I do think if we could turn the clock back, if there had been a way, and we tried, to convince the Libyans to take more help, not just from Americans but from Europeans with whom they had preexisting relationships or even others that might have come to support them\u2014the Scandinavians, for example\u2014help them do more. They were so proud and they were so resistant to having security forces on their territory. They were even resistant to having foreigners come and help them figure out how better to run their oil industry.\nThey had a lot of really smart people who had been expats for decades, they came home and they wanted to do it themselves. If there had been a way that we could have better partnered with them, supported them, maybe it would have made a difference. But this is a long-term prospect that you have to be looking at.\nROSE: Speak to this. I mean we're looking at a world that's changing rapidly. I mean you've got China soon to become the biggest economy in the world and whatever their ambitions are. You have the Middle East which is close to exploding in some cases, some would suggest you have the Russians involved, you've got others involved.\nHow do we make our way in a sort of New World order and what is our role to do that?\nCLINTON: Well, I think our role is to lead. You know, the absence of American leadership is not somebody else's leadership.\nROSE: But they say\u2014let me interrupt --\nCLINTON: Nothing.\nROSE: OK. But some argue that there has been a vacuum\u2014that America has not been leading.\nCLINTON: Well, then we should get about the business of leading. If that is a perception, we need to rid the perception.\nROSE: Who knows better than that than you? I mean there is a perception that we were not prepared to lead.\nCLINTON: Well, look, I think it is a very\u2014\nROSE: And a vacuum was created.\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's a very complex set of circumstances, and it's important to look short-term, medium-term, long-term, right? I remember in some of the arguments I had in the White House over Mubarak. And you know, there was a lot of excitement about Mubarak falling. I was one of the skeptics, right, because what was going to replace him? Yes, had he been a heavy-handed authoritarian? He had. But what was the alternative? And I remember saying, you know, this may look great in 25 years, but between now and then, there is a lot of trouble for the Egyptians, the region and us.\nAnd so I think you have to be constantly balancing what is the best decision you can make today, how do you think about what comes next, what are the consequences you're either trying to promote or prevent, and then what are the long-term challenges and how do we get prepared for those? I mean it sounds easy to say. It's very difficult to do.\nAnd I think, look, when I became Secretary of State, Osama bin laden was alive and with his lieutenants plotting against us. Iran was on a fast track to a nuclear weapon. We had hundreds of thousands of American troops in the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan and our alliances were incredibly frayed, Charlie. You know, it's important to remember that, in 2009, our big challenges were seemingly as difficult as the ones we're talking about now.\nSo all these years later\u2014\nROSE: Compounded by economic problems.\nCLINTON:?\u2014compounded by a terrible great recession that could have become a great depression. And so we worked our way out of that. I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for literally saving the economy from a much worse fate.\nBin laden is dead. Al Qaeda is still alive. It's on, you know, maybe life support, but it's still alive. It's still kicking. It still is inspirational. We have to keep our eye on it. We can't just focus on ISIS. We have to be aware of al Qaeda's continue maneuvering.\nWe did reach an agreement that put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapon program which could have led to a conflagration in the Persian Gulf. Not maybe started by us but in which we might very well have\u2014\nROSE: OK, but that did not speak to Iranian behavior.\nCLINTON: No but\u2014it wasn't meant to.\nROSE: I understand that. I understood that. I am not suggesting it should have been.\nCLINTON: Yes, right.\nROSE: I am suggesting that Iranian behavior is going to be an issue for the next president.\nCLINTON: Absolutely. And I've been saying this\u2014again, I gave a big speech about what I will do as president and to deal with enforcing the agreement, because there are a lot of important details, and the Iranians have to know right from the beginning that they will pay a price, that there will be consequences for any misbehavior or breaches. And that we have to now turn our attention to dealing with their other bad behavior\u2014still exporting terrorism, destabilizing other regimes.\nSo, yes, there is a bucket of problems that we have to deal with that the Iranians are posing.\nROSE: But how do we deal with those problems because they are part of\u2014\nCLINTON: Charlie, I would rather deal with those with the nuclear program.\nROSE: I'm not arguing about the nuclear\u2014\nCLINTON: No, but this is a big deal because what the nuclear program literally under lid, so to speak\u2014\nROSE: Right.\nCLINTON: Now, it's not so, you know, important that we stay as focused. We have to enforce the agreement but we're not spending all our time and effort dealing with their nuclear program which they really got under fast track when Bush was president and we had to deal with it.\nNow we have to look at all their other bad behavior and we have to have the same kind of patient, strategic planning that went in to the agreement. You know, I started putting together the coalition to impose the sanctions within the first month of being in the secretary of state's office. It takes time.\nI had to convince the Russians and the Chinese. I had to convince the Europeans, especially the southern Europeans to give up oil and gas from Iran.\nThis was a long struggle, basically, but it was diplomacy that was day by day which reached results. Now we've got to take a look and say, OK, what is it we have to do? Well, clearly, we've got to keep forces in the Persian Gulf. We've got to do a better job dealing with our Gulf partners who I think are very short-sighted in failing to cooperate with one another, to deal with some of the threats.\nROSE: Yes, but I mean for many of our gulf partners, Iran is the biggest enemy there is. I mean it's part of the Sunni-Shia split in the region.\nCLINTON: Of course it is. Of course it is.\nROSE: And that's why they want to get rid of Assad who is supported by the Iranians as you know.\nCLINTON: And he's an Alawites which is, you know, an off shoot of Shiism. Yes, we get all of that. But the good news out of the Iran agreement, as far as we know, they are not pursuing their own nuclear weapons right now. And that was a very real threat.\nThey understood that the agreement was better than they thought it would be, so they, too, can turn their attention to the rest of this bad behavior because what our big fear was, not only that we'd get a war over trying to prevent Iran from going forward with this program even if it was only two or three years, but that we would see a wicked race to proliferation in the Gulf.\nROSE: And this deal should stop that?\nCLINTON: At least for the years that it's in effect, as long as we enforce it.\nROSE: This conversation part is about American leadership.\nCLINTON: Right.\nROSE: You suggested over the weekend I think that America should lead at the climate conference in Paris.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nROSE: How should America lead there and what are your expectations?\nCLINTON: Well, I give kudos to the President. I think given the hand he was dealt by this congress and the difficulty in trying to come up with a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own country, he has played that hand very well. I mean a lot of the EPA moves, a lot of the Department of Transportation on greater mileage from cars and trucks and vehicles, I think he goes to Paris in a strong position to be able to say, look, we all have to come and agree.\nROSE: Right.\nCLINTON: He also comes with a commitment for the United States to do more on innovation and moving more quickly toward clean energy, and he comes with the great philanthropic commitment of Bill Gates.\nROSE: Do you think he'll be successful? Yes, $100 million.\nCLINTON: Yes, yes.\nROSE: You think so. You think we'll find some progress because there is a sense of almost the urgency that we are talking about with respect to the Middle East?\nCLINTON: Well, in many ways, Charlie, I mean the Middle East is a terrible, complex human problem. And it drives you crazy because you keep saying to yourself, if these people would only stop this, they could build economies, they could have so much to contribute to the world. So you rack your brain about this.\nClimate change is such a consequential crisis to everybody in the world. And it is a great shame to the entire human race, but particularly to the advanced economies such as ours, that we haven't made common cause to try to reverse or at least stabilize the temperature increase. And I'm really hoping that we get a good result out of Paris, and I think what the Chinese have done is really smart. You know, when President Obama and I crashed into their meeting in '09 in Copenhagen, they were not happy to see us.\nROSE: Where are the Chinese?? Where are the Chinese?\nCLINTON: Yes. But they did agree to begin voluntary recording and accountability. Now they've come with I think a 900-page report and they've said look, we have a lot of work to do, because they can't breathe the air, their water is polluted. Their land is polluted. They have said, OK, we're going to deal with this.\nBut you know what the real trick here is? They're going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\nROSE: Unless?\nCLINTON: Unless we get there first or unless we are partners.\nROSE: It takes money as well does it not?\nCLINTON: It takes money but they're going to\u2014they're going to make big investments\u2014\nROSE: Innovation and creativity.\nCLINTON:?\u2014in solar, in wind, and everything else. And then they're going to be exporting and they're going to be controlling that market unless we understand there is a huge economic opportunity that goes hand in hand with climate change.\nROSE: Let me ask you about trade, too.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nROSE: I mean how important\u2014we have a vote coming up in Congress.\nCLINTON: Right.\nROSE: Would you encourage\u2014I mean trade is an important aspect. You were very strongly in favor of the trade agreement.\nCLINTON: Well, I was in favor of the high hopes and standards for it. Right.\nROSE: That's fair enough.\nYou understand the importance of trade.\nCLINTON: Yes, of course I do. We're 5 percent of the world's population. If we're going to grow, we have to sell to the other 95 percent. I absolutely understand that.\nBut here are two problems. One, I've had the same criteria for judging trade agreements for years. I voted for some and I voted against a big multi-national one when I was in the senate.\nROSE: But you were really in favor of this one?\nCLINTON: No. It hadn't even been negotiated.\nROSE: That's the impression though as you know.\nCLINTON: Well, I can't help what impressions are. What I said from the beginning is it has to produce more good paying jobs for Americans. It has to raise Americans' wages and it has to be in furtherance of our national security. So when it came out, you know, none of us saw the details until it was actually produced some few months ago.\nIn my opinion, it didn't meet those standards. And so I said I'm against it. Now, I'm not against all trade, but I am against certain provisions of this, including the failure to integrate currency manipulation into the enforceable body of the agreement.\nBut there is another point I just want to quickly make which is, you know, the Republicans are always for every trade agreement. Trade if it's going to be successful for the American worker, the American business, has to be more than just special deals for giant multi-national corporations who have some linkage to America.\nAnd the Republicans have blocked every effort to raise the minimum wage, better training, apprenticeship programs, make education more affordable. They have blocked every effort to try to make sure American workers were as prepared as possible to compete and win in the global economy.\nSo, for me, the trade agreement on the merits is not one I can support and the failure to kind of make the other side of the equation fair so that more Americans will get the skills they need to be able to compete, you know, just makes it a decision that I'm not ready to take now.\nROSE: Would you encourage Democratic members of the Congress to vote against it?\nCLINTON: I have stated my position, you know. If anybody wants to talk to me, they're welcome to call me but I have stated my position and I will let the Congress work its will.\nROSE: You announced a significant idea about infrastructure.\nCLINTON: Right.\nROSE: Why has it taken this country so long to deal with infrastructure? What's the problem?\nCLINTON: Well, the problem Charlie is that the Republicans don't want to pay for anything. You know, when I was in the Senate, I was on the committee that was responsible for writing the bill, the Highway Transportation Bill. It was hard because we had a lot of back and forth, but we came out with a bill, we got it done.\nThere has not been a bill that has actually come out for years now. And, so the congress is in the middle of arguing about whether or not they can get a highway bill. But they don't want anybody to pay anything for it. And so, they don't want to use user fees. They don't want any kind of fee that could be construed as a tax, OK.\n[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: At some point, you know, we are crumbling. I mean every independent assessment says the same thing. We have a failing grade or maybe at the most a D-minus\u2014\nROSE: And putting our citizens at risk.\nCLINTON: Well, and costing the money. You know, in a lot of places in this country, people pay a lot to fix axles and wheels and other things that are damaged by potted and deteriorating roads. We have a lot of bridges that if you had a choice you wouldn't cross because they're not in good shape.\nOur airports\u2014we don't have a single airport in the top 20 airports in the entire world. The closest we get is Cincinnati at 30. I mean we have watched over deterioration, to say nothing of what you can't see. Under the ground, you know, in New York we have water mains and sewer mains and gas lines\u2014some of them are blowing up and some of them are cracking.\nROSE: So did we miss an opportunity during the first four years of the Obama administration to do more?\nCLINTON: Well, we did as much as the Congress would let the administration do. The Recovery Act had \"Build America\" bonds. They had money going in to all kinds of construction. We could have done a lot more and we would be better off if we had.\nROSE: This campaign is about middle class economic future.\nCLINTON: Right, right.\nROSE: Do you recommend cutting middle class taxes?\nCLINTON: Well, not raising them, certainly.\nROSE: No, but didn't you say you're in favor of cutting them?\nCLINTON: Well, I'm in favor of giving specific tax credits and breaks so that middle class families can meet some of their obligations. So for example, you know, more help on childcare, more help on care giving like taking care of an elderly relative with Alzheimer's. Making sure we keep tax credits for education.\nSo in effect those are cutting taxes\u2014not an across-the-board cut. They are tied to certain activities, you know, activities or services that middle class people need.\nROSE: But do you also urge raising income taxes on wealthy individuals?\nCLINTON: On you and me? Yes.\nROSE: Yes. You and I'm included. True\nCLINTON: Sorry.\nROSE: And I'm willing.\nCLINTON: Yes. No, really.\nI mean it is\u2014the tax system truly is stacked for those on the top, and it is something that breeds so much resentment and grievance on the part of small businesses, on the part of hard-working people and, you know, the wealthy pay too little and middle class people pay too much and we've got to get a better balance.\nWe do need revenues. I'm not somebody who says we don't. I just want to start with the people who actually can contribute more and make the tax system fair in the process.\nROSE: And what about corporate tax?\nCLINTON: We're going to have to take a hard look at it because right now we have a very high rate but the effective rate hardly ever reaches that.\nROSE: I know. There is over 35 percent. At the same time, I think the average is about 18 or 20 percent.\nCLINTON: Yes. And some get away with nothing.\nROSE: Yes.\nCLINTON: And so\u2014look, I don't want to stifle American entrepreneurialism. I don't want to stifle American business, but I want to change the incentives. That's why when I rolled out my economic plans I said, look, I want strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth. And the long-term growth may be the most important piece.\nI'll tell you just a very quick story. There was a survey done where CEOs of major American corporations were asked this question. If you knew an investment you could make today would pay off down the road by investing in plant and equipment, research and experimentation or worker training, but it would knock a penny off your share price, would you do it? And to a person, they said, no, we can't, we can't do it.\nI actually called up someone we both know to say, seriously? Absolutely. It makes me sick to say was the response, but, no, we can't, we will get hammered, we will be putting a big target on our chest for the activist shareholders. We can't do it. Now, we must change those incentives. We need more patient capital. We need more investments at home.\nROSE: How about payroll tax.\nCLINTON: Well, you know, the payroll taxes\u2014\nROSE: I don't know\u2014what?\nCLINTON: I don't think it's that big a deal.\nROSE: Is that right?\nCLINTON: No because, you know, President Obama suspended it, nobody even noticed because we have to fund social security. That's a different issue.\nROSE: Wouldn't that put money in the pockets right away of the middle class?\nCLINTON: It did but it wasn't\u2014it was not something that people really valued if you\u2014from what I\u2014\nROSE: Politically or economically?\nCLINTON: Apparently both from the research that I've seen.\nROSE: Speaking of corporations.\nPfizer, Allergan\u2014merger, move to Ireland, reduce your tax rate.\nCLINTON: Right. Right.\nROSE: They say, meaning they will be able to have more money to spend because they're not paying big taxes to develop new drugs. They say it's in the interest of the public.\nCLINTON: I never know what to make of these kinds of comments. Personally, I was deeply distressed by the Pfizer decision. And I know, for instance, that drug companies spend more money on advertising than they do on research in our country. And so when they say, oh, we're going to be able to spend more money on research, I would love to know the numbers. I find that hard to buy.\nI think there is a certain gamesmanship associated with it which I find really regrettable, you know. It's, like, OK, if we can beat the system\u2014and Ireland has had this big welcome sign, you know, we're going to go down as low as we can\u2014\nROSE: Right.\nCLINTON:?\u2014I mean the rest of Europe is annoyed, the United States is annoyed, but I don't think inversions should be legal and I know that the Justice Department and Treasury Department have looked at those. I don't think they should be.\nROSE: The President said they're unpatriotic.\nCLINTON: Well, they are. I mean truly, when you think about it, I mean Pfizer is a New York company. That's where its roots have been. And obviously, as time went by, it employed fewer people but it's always been an American flagship company.\nAnd for them to say, you know, this is just really a game\u2014because if you listen to it, you know, how many executives are actually going to move to Dublin? No, they're going to move virtually. They're going to move, you know, the button you press on your computer to say this is where intellectual property now lives, you know, apparently in a castle outside of Dublin.\nROSE: They're not going to pick up their factories and go\u2014\nCLINTON: Well no. They don't have that many left and I'm sure they have a global reach on that. But it's really a kick in the teeth. I mean this country has done more to inspire this kind of innovation than any place in the world.\nROSE: OK. But you have a lot of companies like Apple, for example, have a lot of money overseas.\nCLINTON: Right.\nROSE: And they say, you know, make it more\u2014give us some amnesty, do something, and we'll bring that money home. What would you say?\nCLINTON: We'll have to look at all of that. I mean yes. But let me tell you\u2014we did repatriate when I was in the Senate, OK, under George W. Bush. We repatriated, they said the same thing to us. And I know I had a parade of people coming in\u2014CEOs and CFOs saying we really need to do this and when we get the money back, we're going to do x, y, z. And what did they do? They bought back shares. They increased the dividends\u2014\nROSE: And stock price\u2014stock prices were up.\nCLINTON:?\u2014and they put more money into CEO pay and bonus. George W. Bush is on record as saying he would never have supported at the end because they all lied us to. So if we're going to do a repatriation, it's going to have to be rock solid and very clear about where that money goes and what it's used for.\nNow, I think we have to look at the entire corporate code. I don't want to preside over an exodus of American companies. I want people coming here to invest. I want people, you know, building the next generation of whatever it is\u2014clean energy, technology, you name it.\nSo I want to be a good president for business, but I also want to be a good president for everybody in America, not just for, you know, CEOs and activist shareholders.\nROSE: Have you suffered from the fact that they say you're too close to Wall Street? Has that hurt your image, in your judgment, running for president?\nCLINTON: I don't think so. I mean look\u2014\nROSE: Not in favor of corporate regulations as she should be, says Elizabeth Warren.\nCLINTON: Well, all I know is that it was in 2007 that I called out Wall Street on the use of securities to, you know, play the mortgage market and called them out on the hedge fund loophole for carried interest.\nI have been very outspoken on this. And I have stood for a lot of regulation on big banks and on the financial services sector. I also represented New York and represented everybody from the dairy farmers, you know, to the fishermen.\nROSE: From Wall Street to the dairy farmers.\nCLINTON: Yes\u2014everybody. And so yes, do I know people and did I help rebuild after 9\/11? Yes, I did but --\nROSE: And did you take money from them, they would say.\nCLINTON: Yes, but that has nothing to do with my position. Anybody who thinks that they can influence me on that ground doesn't know me very well. And these guys know me and they, you know\u2014\nROSE: Would you say the same thing when you see these reports about the foundation and money from the foundation while you were secretary of state, people were coming in to your\u2014\nCLINTON: It's ludicrous. I mean it's ludicrous. I mean there's no there, there but the fact is I saw a lot of people when I was secretary of state and I worked really hard to increase exports from American businesses. I saw a lot of business people, I saw a lot of union leaders. I saw as many people as I could fit in the day who needed something from their government.\nYou know, somebody would\u2014Fred Smith would call me up from FedEx and say the Chinese government is taking away our permits. We have been in China for decades doing Federal Express. Or Corning, a company that I knew well from my time in the senate\u2014they're trying to put a tariff on us that is going to drive us out of business. You know, I worked really hard to get more jobs for Americans, and that meant representing big business and small business and everybody in between.\nROSE: Do we need to regulate Wall Street more than\u2014\nCLINTON: We do. That's why I have probably the toughest, most comprehensive plan and it goes way beyond Glass-Steagall. It is much broader than that. It looks at shadow banking. It looks at all of the parts of the financial markets that influenced what happened in '08 but are not big banks like AIG, like Lehman Brothers. And Paul Krugman says I have the best plan. And Sherrod Brown who is a very tough\u2014\nROSE: Senator from Ohio.\nCLINTON:?\u2014critic of the banks thinks I have the best plan.\nROSE: Right, OK.\nWhy do you want to be president? I mean you have had a remarkable life.\nCLINTON: Yes, I have.\nROSE: You have been in the White House. There it is over there.\nCLINTON: There it is, right.\nWell, I'm not doing it to move back in, although it's a wonderful place.\nROSE: So why are you doing it? I mean you know\u2014is it about history? Is it about the first woman?\nCLINTON: No, no. I mean that would all be an extra added part of it. But for me, I really love this country and I think this will be one of those watershed elections where we're either going to get the economy to work for everybody or we are going to see increasing inequality and unfairness in a way that we haven't seen since, you know, the 1920s.\nWe're either going to figure out how to live together despite all of our differences, show respect for people, enforce human rights, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, workers' rights or we're going to really have the balance shift dramatically against the kind of democracy that I believe in that I think works best for America and we're either going to lead around the world or we're going to take a back seat and pay a big price for it.\nSo there is a lot at stake in this election and, you know, the Republicans are certainly spurring me on because of what they say and how they say it and their values which are so negative and really mean-spirited in lots of ways.\nSo I believe that we've got to wage and win an election about the future and the kind of country we want to have for, you know, my grandchild.\nROSE: How is she doing?\nCLINTON: She's great. We had Thanksgiving with her. It was marvelous.\nROSE: Thank you for coming.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nROSE: Pleasure to see you.\nCLINTON: Good to talk to you.\n","4":"\nCLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]\nThank you, Richard. And thanks for the great work that the council does under your leadership. It truly is an important resource for us all.\nFareed, I look forward to having the conversation with you, everyone here at the council, and Mr. Mayor. Thank you very much for being here and for everything you are doing and will do to keep our city safe and strong. I'm very grateful.\nI wanted to come here to our city, which has shown such resilience in the face of terrorism, to talk about the events of the past week, and the work we must do together to protect our country and our friends.\nWhen the United States was hit on 9\/11, our allies treated that attack against one as an attack against all. Now, it's our turn to stand in solidarity with France and all of our friends. We cherish the same values. We face the same adversaries. We must share the same determination.\nAfter a major terrorist attack, every society faces a choice between fear and resolve. The world's great democracies can't sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. Therefore, we must choose resolve. And we must lead the world to meet this threat.\nNow, let's be clear about what we're facing. Beyond Paris in recent days, we've seen deadly terrorist attacks in Nigeria, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey, and a Russian civilian airline destroyed over the Sinai. At the heart of today's new landscape of terror is ISIS. They persecute religious and ethnic minorities; kidnap and behead civilians; murder children. They systematically enslave, torture and rape women and girls.\nISIS operates across three mutually reinforcing dimensions: a physical enclave in Iraq and Syria; an international terrorist network that includes affiliates across the region and beyond; and an ideological movement of radical jihadism. We have to target and defeat all three, and time is of the essence.\nISIS is demonstrating new ambition, reach and capabilities. We have to break the group's momentum and then its back. Our goal is not to deter or contain ISIS, but to defeat and destroy ISIS.\nBut we have learned that we can score victories over terrorist leaders and networks, only to face metastasizing threats down the road, so we also have to play and win the long game. We should pursue a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy, one that embeds our mission against ISIS within a broader struggle against radical jihadism that is bigger than any one group, whether it's Al Qaida or ISIS or some other network.\nAn immediate war against an urgent enemy and a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots will not be easily torn out. It will require sustained commitment in every pillar of American power. This is a worldwide fight, and American must lead it.\nOur strategy should have three main elements. One, defeat ISIS in Syria, Iraq and across the Middle East; two, disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing arms and propaganda around the world; three, harden our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats.\nLet me start with the campaign to defeat ISIS across the region. The United States and our international coalition has been conducting this fight for more than a year. It's time to begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts to smash the would-be caliphate and deny ISIS control of territory in Iraq and Syria. That starts with a more effective coalition air campaign, with more allied planes, more strikes and a broader target set.\nA key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about ISIS and its operations, so we need an immediate intelligence surge in the region, including technical assets, Arabic speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services. Our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with Al Qaida in the past. This would help us identify and eliminate ISIS' command and control and its economic lifelines.\nA more effective coalition air campaign is necessary, but not sufficient, and we should be honest about the fact that to be successful, airstrikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from ISIS. Like President Obama, I do not believe that we should again have 100,000 American troops in combat in the Middle East. That is just not the smart move to make here. If we have learned anything from 15 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's that local people and nations have to secure their own communities. We can help them, and we should, but we cannot substitute for them. But we can and should support local and regional ground forces in carrying out this mission.\nNow, the obstacles to achieving this are significant. On the Iraqi side of the border, Kurdish forces have fought bravely to defend their own lands and to re-take towns from ISIS, but the Iraqi national army has struggled, and it's going to take more work to get it up to fighting shape. As part of that process, we may have to give our own troops advising and training the Iraqis greater freedom of movement and flexibility, including embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes.\nUltimately, however, a ground campaign in Iraq will only succeed if more Iraqi Sunnis join the fight. But that won't happen so long as they do not feel they have a stake in their country or confidence in their own security and capacity to confront ISIS.\nNow, we've been in a similar place before in Iraq. In the first Sunni awakening in 2007, we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the Sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out Al Qaida. Unfortunately, under Prime Minister Maliki's rule, those tribes were betrayed and forgotten.\nSo the task of bringing Sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult. But nonetheless, we need to lay the foundation for a second Sunni awakening. We need to put sustained pressure on the government in Baghdad to get its political house in order, move forward with national reconciliation, and finally stand up a national guard. Baghdad needs to accept, even embrace, arming Sunni and Kurdish forces in the war against ISIS. But if Baghdad won't do that, the coalition should do so directly.\nOn the Syrian side, the big obstacle to getting more ground forces to engage ISIS, beyond the Syrian Kurds who are already deep in the fight, is that the viable Sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting Assad who, let us remember, has killed many more Syrians than the terrorists have. But they are increasingly under threat from ISIS as well.\nSo we need to move simultaneously toward a political solution to the civil war that paves the way for a new government with new leadership, and to encourage more Syrians to take on ISIS as well. To support them, we should immediately deploy the special operations force President Obama has already authorized, and be prepared to deploy more as more Syrians get into the fight. And we should retool and ramp up our efforts to support and equip viable Syrian opposition units.\nOur increased support should go hand in hand with increased support from our Arab and European partners, including special forces who can contribute to the fight on the ground. We should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no-fly zones that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air. Opposition forces on the ground, with material support from the coalition, could then help create safe areas where Syrians could remain in the country, rather than fleeing toward Europe.\nThis combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the Turkish border from ISIS, choking off its supply lines. It would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that Secretary Kerry is pursuing.\nOf course, we've been down plenty of diplomatic dead-ends before in this conflict. But we have models for how seemingly intractable multi-sectarian civil wars do eventually end. We can learn lessons from Lebanon and Bosnia about what it will take. And Russia and Iran have to face the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability.\nRight now, I'm afraid, President Putin is actually making things somewhat worse.\nNow, to be clear, though, there is an important role for Russia to help in resolving the conflict in Syria. And we have indicated a willingness to work with them toward an outcome that preserves Syria as a unitary, nonsectarian state, with protections for the rights of all Syrians and to keep key state institutions intact.\nThere is no alternative to a political transition that allows Syrians to end Assad's rule.\nNow, much of this strategy on both sides of the border hinges on the roles of our Arab and Turkish partners. And we must get them to carry their share of the burden, with military intelligence and financial contributions, as well as using their influence with fighters and tribes in Iraq and Syria.\nCountries like Jordan have offered more, and we should take them up on it, because ultimately our efforts will only succeed if the Arabs and Turks step up in a much bigger way. This is their fight and they need to act like it.\nSo far, however, Turkey has been more focused on the Kurds than on countering ISIS. And to be fair, Turkey has a long and painful history with Kurdish terrorist groups. But the threat from ISIS cannot wait. As difficult as it may be, we need to get Turkey to stop bombing Kurdish fighters in Syria who are battling ISIS, and become a full partner in our coalition efforts against ISIS.\nThe United States should also work with our Arab partners to get them more invested in the fight against ISIS. At the moment, they're focused in other areas because of their concerns in the region, especially the threat from Iran. That's why the Saudis, for example, shifted attention from Syria to Yemen. So we have to work out a common approach.\nIn September, I laid out a comprehensive plan to counter Iranian influence across the region and its support for terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas. We cannot view Iran and ISIS as separate challenges. Regional politics are too interwoven. Raising the confidence of our Arab partners and raising the costs to Iran for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against ISIS.\nAnd as we work out a broader regional approach, we should, of course, be closely consulting with Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East. Israel increasingly shares with our Arab partners and has the opportunity to do more in intelligence and joint efforts as well.\nNow, we should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is. We have to fit a lot of pieces together, bring along a lot of partners, move on multiple fronts at once. But if we press forward on both sides of the border, in the air and on the ground, as well as diplomatically, I do believe we can crush ISIS's enclave of terror.\nAnd to support this campaign, Congress should swiftly pass an updated authorization to use military force. That will send a message to friend and foe alike that the United States is committed to this fight. The time for delay is over. We should get this done.\nNow, the second element of our strategy looks beyond the immediate battlefield of Iraq and Syria, to disrupt and dismantle global terrorist infrastructure on the ground and online.\nA terror pipeline that facilitates the flow of fighters, financing, arms and propaganda around the world has allowed ISIS to strike at the heart of Paris last week and an Al Qaida affiliate to do the same at Charlie Hebdo earlier this year. ISIS is working hard to extend its reach, establish affiliates and cells far from its home base, and despite the significant setbacks it has encountered, not just with ISIS and its ambitious plans, but even Al Qaida, including the death of Osama bin Laden, they are still posing great threats to so many.\nLet's take one example. We've had a lot of conversation about ISIS in the last week, let's not forget Al Qaida. They still have the most sophisticated bombmakers, ambitious plotters and active affiliates in places like Yemen and North Africa, so we can't just focus on Iraq and Syria, we need to intensify our counter\u2014our counterterrorism efforts on a wider scope.\nMost urgent is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the war zones of the Middle East. Thousands\u2014thousands of young recruits have flocked to Syria from France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and, yes, even the United States. Their western passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home radicalized and battle hardened. Stemming this tide will require much better coordination and information-sharing among countries every step of the way. We should not stop pressing until Turkey, where most foreign fighters cross into Syria, finally locks down its border.\nThe United States and our allies need to know and share the identities of every fighter who has traveled to Syria. We also have to be smart and target interventions that will have the greatest impact. For example, we need a greater focus on shutting down key enablers who arrange transportation, documents and more.\nWhen it comes to terrorist financing, we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions. The U.N. Security Council should update its terrorism sanctions. They have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities, but we have to place more obligations on countries to police their own banks, and the United States, which has quite a record of success in this area, can share more intelligence to help other countries. And once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as the schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path to radicalization. When it comes to blocking terrorist recruitment, we have to identify the hotspots, the specific neighborhoods and villages, the prisons and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, like the neighborhood in Brussels where the Paris attacks were planned. Through partnerships with local law enforcement and civil society, especially with Muslim community leaders, we have to work to tip the balance away from extremism in these hotspots.\nRadicalization and recruitment also is happening online. There's no doubt we have to do a better job contesting online space, including websites and chat rooms where jihadists communicate with followers. We must deny them virtual territory just as we deny them actual territory.\nAt the State Department, I built up a unit of communication specialists fluent in Urdu, Arabic, Somali and other languages to battle with extremists online.\nWe need more of that, including from the private sector. Social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts, so they're not used to plan, provoke or celebrate violence.\nOnline or off-line, the bottom line is that we are in a contest of ideas against an ideology of hate, and we have to win. Let's be clear, though, Islam is not our adversary. Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. The obsession in some quarters with a clash of civilization, or repeating the specific words radical Islamic terrorism isn't just a distraction, it gives these criminals, these murderers more standing than they deserve. It actually plays into their hands by alienating partners we need by our side.\nOur priority should be how to fight the enemy. In the end, it didn't matter what kind of terrorist we call bin Laden, it mattered that we killed bin Laden. But we still can't close our eyes to the fact that there is a distorted and dangerous stream of extremism within the Muslim world that continues to spread. Its adherents are relatively few in number, but capable of causing profound damage, most especially to their own communities throughout an arc of instability that stretches from North and West Africa to Asia.\nOverlapping conflicts, collapsing state structures, widespread corruption, poverty and repression have created openings for extremists to exploit.\nBefore the Arab Spring, I warned that the region's foundations would sink into the sand without immediate reforms. Well, the need has only grown more urgent. We have to join with our partners to do the patient's steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists; supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law; creating economic growth that supports stability; working to curb corruption, helping training effective and accountable law enforcement, intelligence and counterterrorism services. As we do this, we must be building up a global counterterrorism infrastructure that is more active and adaptable than the terror networks we're trying to defeat.\nWhen I became secretary of State, I was surprised to find that nearly a decade after 9\/11, there was still no dedicated international vehicle to regularly convene key countries to deal with terrorist threats.\nSo, we created the Global Counterterrorism Forum, which now brings together nearly 30 countries, many from the Muslim world. It should be a clearing house for directing assistance to countries that need it, for mobilizing common action against threats.\nAnd let's not lose sight of the global cooperation needed to lock down loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons, and keep them out of the hands of terrorists.\nAt the end of the day, we still must be prepared to go after terrorists wherever they plot using all the tools at our disposal, that includes targeted strikes by U.S. military aircraft and drones, with proper safeguards when there are any other viable options to deal with continuing imminent threats.\nAll of this\u2014stopping foreign fighters, blocking terrorist financing, doing battle in cyberspace\u2014is vital to the war against ISIS, but it also lays the foundation for defusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that.\nNow, the third element of our strategy has to be hardening our defenses at home and helping our partners do the same against both external and home-grown threats. After 9\/11, the United States made a lot of progress breaking down bureaucratic barriers to allow for more and better information sharing among agencies responsible for keeping us safe.\nWe still have work to do on this front, but by comparison, Europe is way behind. Today, European nations don't even always alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen. It seems like after most terrorist attacks, we find out that the perpetrators were known to some security service or another, but too often the dots never get connected.\nI appreciate how hard this is, especially given the sheer number of suspects and threats, but this has to change. The United States must work with Europe to dramatically and immediately improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism coordination. European countries also should have the flexibility to enhance their border controls when circumstances warrant.\nAnd here at home, we face a number of our own challenges. The threat to airline security is evolving as terrorists develop new devices like nonmetallic bombs. So our defenses have to stay at least one step ahead. We know that intelligence gathered and shared by local law enforcement officers is absolutely critical to breaking up plots and preventing attacks. So they need all the resources and support we can give them.\nLaw enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities, including in our own country Muslim Americans. Now, this should go without saying, but in the current climate, it bears repeating. Muslim Americans are working every day on the front lines of the fight against radicalization.\nAnother challenge is how to strike the right balance of protecting privacy and security. Encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem. We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. They have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack. On the other hand, we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit. So we need Silicon Valley not to view government as its adversary. We need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy.\nNow is the time to solve this problem, not after the next attack.\nSince Paris, no homeland security challenge is being more hotly debated than how to handle Syrian refugees seeking safety in the United States. Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people. So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals, in close coordination with our allies and partners.\nAnd Congress need to make sure the necessary resources are provided for comprehensive background checks, drawing on the best intelligence we can get. And we should be taking a close look at the safeguards in the visa programs as well, but we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations. Turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every Syrian refugee, that is just not who we are. We are better than that.\nAnd remember, many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us. It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones. We should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis, not less. We should lead the international community in organizing a donor conference and supporting countries like Jordan who are sheltering the majority of refugees fleeing Syria.\nAnd we can get this right. America's open, free, tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism, but I actually believe it's one of our strengths. It reduces the appeal of radicalism and enhances the richness and resilience of our communities. This is not a time for scoring political points.\nWhen New York was attacked on 9\/11, we had a Republican president, a Republican governor and a Republican mayor, and I worked with all of them. We pulled together and put partisanship aside to rebuild our city and protect our country. This is a time for American leadership. No other country can rally the world to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadism. Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale, and that's exactly what we need. The entire world must be part of this fight, but we must lead it.\nThere's been a lot of talk lately about coalitions. Everyone seems to want one, but there's not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to make a coalition work in the heat and pressure of an international crisis. I know how hard this is because we've done it before. To impose the toughest sanctions in history on Iran, to stop a dictator from slaughtering his people in Libya, to support a fledgling democracy in Afghanistan, we have to use every pillar of American power\u2014military and diplomacy, development and economic and cultural influence, technology and maybe most importantly our values. That is smart power.\nWe have to work with institutions and partners like NATO, the E.U., the Arab League and the U.N., strengthen our alliances and never get tired of old-fashioned shoe leather diplomacy, and if necessary be prepared to act decisively on our own, just as we did it to bring Osama bin Laden to justice.\nThe United States and our allies must demonstrate that free people and free markets are still the hope of humanity. This past week, as I watched the tragic scenes from France, I kept thinking back to a young man in the world met in January after the last attack in Paris. His name was Lassana, a Muslim immigrant from Mali who worked at a kosher market. He said the market had become a new home and his colleagues and customers a second family.\nWhen the terrorist arrived and the gunfire began, Lassana risked his life to protect his Jewish customers. He moved quickly, hiding as many people as he could in the cold storage room, and then slipping out to help the police.\n\"I didn't know or care, he said, if they were Jews or Christians or Muslims. We're all in the same boat.\" What a rebuke to the extremists' hatred.\nThe French government announced it would grant Lassana full citizenship. But when it mattered most, he proved he was a citizen already.\nThat's the power of free people. That's what the jihadis will never understand and never defeat. And as we meet here today, let us resolve that we will go forward together, and we will do all we can to lead the world against this threat that threatens people everywhere.\nThank you all. [applause]\nQUESTION: Thank you so much, Madam Secretary, and thanks to Richard Haass again, for organizing this extraordinary opportunity.\nIn the week of the Paris attacks, President Obama said that he thought what was needed now was an intensification of his existing strategy against ISIS.\nIs what you're proposing an intensification of the existing strategy, or a change to it?\nCLINTON: Well, as I said in the speech, it is, in many ways, an intensification, an acceleration of the strategy. But it has to also intensify and accelerate our efforts in the other arenas.\nWhat we have done with airstrikes has made a difference, but now it needs to make a greater difference and we need more of a coalition, you know, flying those missions with us.\nWhat we have done, with the president saying there would be special forces sent, it is right in line with what I think that they need to get there, and we need to take stock of whether we need more, and we need to also empower our trainers in Iraq to have more support to do what they're trying to accomplish by getting the Iraqi Army, once again, to be a fighting force.\nAnd we need\u2014one thing that I believe we haven't done yet is make it clear to Baghdad that we are going to be arming Sunni tribes and Kurds if they don't, because at some point, they have to be in the fight. The Kurds, as you know, are fighting bravely on both sides of the border, and they need the support that we've given them and some of the special ops work, and the assault and taking back of Sinjar.\nAnd then, these other two elements that I mentioned. We have pieces in place, but I think we have to deepen and better coordinate, not only within our own country in Europe, but more broadly.\nQUESTION: Do you believe that President Obama underestimated ISIS when he called it the J.V. team?\nCLINTON: Look, I don't think it's useful to go back in and replow old ground. I think that, from the perspective of what they had accomplished at that time, even though they had seized and held territory, the major focus of our government was on trying to remove Assad from power, so that there could be a resolution, a political resolution.\nAnd there were so many groups fighting. There were so many other factors at work. Now that ISIS has made clear that I think in part because they have been pushed hard by the airstrikes, by the Kurds, they're now expanding their reach so that they can keep their propaganda going.\nSo I think there's been, you know, an evolution in their threat and we have to meet it.\nQUESTION: A couple of days ago, the New York Times had a headline that said, \"Paris Attacks Complicate Hillary Clinton's Alignment With Obama.\" Has it?\nCLINTON: Well, it's not the first headline I've disagreed with. [laughter]\nLook, I\u2014I have made clear that I have differences, as I think any two people do. I was very proud to serve as President Obama's secretary of state. I think we made a good team. We largely agreed on what needed to be done to repair our alliances, to get our country in a position to deal with the wars that had been inherited, and to take on some of the new challenges we faced.\nBut even when I was still there, which is publicly known, I thought we needed to do more earlier to try to identify indigenous Syrian fighters, so-called \"moderates\"\u2014and I do think there were some early on\u2014that we could have done more to help them in their fight against Assad. But, you know, this is an evolving and fast-moving situation. I think we're all, you know, working to, you know, make sure that what we do actually will produce the results we seek.\nQUESTION: When you were secretary of state, you tended to agree a great deal with the then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates. Gates was opposed to a no-fly zone in Syria; thought it was an act of war that was risky and dangerous. This seems to me the major difference right now between what the president\u2014what Obama's administration is doing and what you're proposing.\nDo you not\u2014why do you disagree with Bob Gates on this?\nCLINTON: Well, I\u2014I believe that the no-fly zone is merited and can be implemented, again, in a coalition, not an American-only no-fly zone. I fully respect Bob and his knowledge about the difficulties of implementing a no-fly zone. But if you look at where we are right now, we have to try to clear the air of the bombing attacks that are still being carried out to a limited extent by the Syrian military, now supplemented by the Russian air force.\nAnd I think we have a chance to do that now. We have a no-fly zone over northern Iraq for years to protect the Kurds. And it proved to be successful, not easy\u2014it never is\u2014but I think now is the time for us to revisit those plans.\nI also believe, as I said in the speech, that if we begin the conversation about a no-fly zone, something that, you know, Turkey discussed with me back when I was secretary of state in 2012, it will confront a lot of our partners in the region and beyond about what they're going to do. And it can give us leverage in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is carrying on right now.\nSo I see it as both a strategic opportunity on the ground, and an opportunity for leverage in the peace negotiations.\nQUESTION: You talked about Arab partners, but it's worth noting that after having announced with great fanfare that they would join us in the strikes, Saudi Arabia has essentially dropped out. The UAE has essentially dropped out.\nWhat would you\u2014what could\u2014can you do particularly to make these key Sunni states that seem more interested in fighting in Yemen, where they are battling a Shiite force, as they see it? What can you do to make them actually take this on as their struggle?\nCLINTON: Well, that's\u2014we did build that coalition with respect to Libya. We had the UAE, Qatar, Jordan involved in what we were doing on the ground, and it takes constant outreach and, obviously, you have to define the problem in a way that they see it as affecting their national interests. And you're right, the Saudis were actually involved in Syria and now have put all of their resources against the Houthis and the Iranian backers of the Houthis in Yemen.\nNow, what does that mean? Well, it means that they see the battle that they want to fight as one against Iran and its proxies. My argument to them would be, left unattended, you could have Iranian reach from Tehran to Baghdad. If you allow Syria to fall into as terrible a distress as it currently is and basically Assad being a proxy for, a frontman for the Iranians, the Russians are interested in their naval base. And so you will find a consolidation of authority with the Iranians and moving into Baghdad even more so.\nSo what you're facing in Yemen could be a limited preview of what you could face going forward, unless we get some concerted effort to stop the fighting and to seek a political solution that does give some room to all the different groups within Syria to have a say in the future.\nQUESTION: Donald Trump says that if you look back, you see that every time\u2014I get a laugh just saying it...[laughter]... Donald Trump says that every time we deposed or encouraged the removal of a dictator in the Middle East, what has followed has been political chaos and a worse humanitarian situation than existed before. And if you look at Iraq, if you look at Libya, if you look Yemen, you look at the fragility of the Assad regime and what it has produced, isn't he right?\nCLINTON: Well, he has a very short-term view of history, because it is not at all clear what the final outcome will be in the places that you named. As I mentioned in the speech, I spoke about the foundations of the region sinking into the sand just as the Arab Spring was breaking. And I did so not knowing about the Arab Spring coming to full bloom, but because it was so clear that what was being done by dictatorships, by the denial of opportunity, by the repression, by the sectarian divide just could not stand. It was going to explode at some point or another.\nAnd with the developments in Libya, for example, the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want. They have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others. So it's\u2014I think it's too soon to tell and I think it's something that we have to be, you know, looking at very closely.\nNow, deposing Milosevic left problems, but problems that we came at by having a deal\u2014in fact, my husband's in Dayton today speaking about the Dayton Accord where people who had been slaughtering each other had to come together and resolve to exist within a government together. Is it perfect? No, but has it, you know, kind of going, and do we have some work to do there? Absolutely.\nSo, we have to look at all these different situations, I think, on their own as well as part of bigger trends.\nQUESTION: Several of the people running against you against\u2014against whoever the Democrat is, argue that\u2014argue that we should not be taking in Syrian refugees, but we do, we should prioritize Christian refugees.\nJeb Bush has said this, Ted Cruz has said this. And the argument is that they are being persecuted, particularly harshly by ISIS.\nWhy isn't that right?\nCLINTON: Well, I just don't think we should have religious tests about who we bring as refugees into our country. We've had\u2014last I looked, more than 2 million refugees since 1990.\nSo far, we know that trying to do vet and understand the connections that a person or a family might have with somebody in the United States, you know, looking to see what organization, often a faith-based organization, will sponsor them and what they'll do to help them get education or a job, is by far the best way to sort out and to determine who should be included.\nNow, this is going to take a long time, I mean, really doing this is hard under any circumstances. Doing it when people are essentially stateless, they don't necessarily have documents, it's hard to do the vetting, is going to be challenging. Which is, again, why I said in the speech that Congress should be providing resources for us to do it right, you know, not trying to stop it.\nI just don't believe that's in keeping with our values or our history, and frankly it doesn't send the kind of message that we want to send to the rest of the world.\nSo, yeah, we have to be careful, we have to be vigilant and we have to have a system that does all of that.\nQUESTION: Let's open it up to members of the Council.\nLet me\u2014if somebody wants to put up their hand, identify themselves, and please make sure it is a question, with a question mark at the end, and it be brief. So.\nQUESTION: Thank you very much for your comments.\nWith respect to TPP, I would like to understand a little bit better why you oppose it, and what changes would perhaps make it acceptable to you?\nCLINTON: I think\u2014you know, there are two problems that I see with it.\nOne the final language of the treaty itself, which I don't think went far enough to meet the test that I've always applied to any trade agreement\u2014I have voted for them and I have voted against them when I was a senator\u2014does it help to create more good paying jobs in America? Does it raise incomes, does it advance our national security?\nAnd I think there are enough unanswered questions. It was an\u2014it was an extraordinary effort to try to bring these countries together to come up with an agreement, but I think that at the end of the day, for a number of reasons, including that they couldn't figure how to get currency into the agreement and it's only in a side agreement, I opposed it.\nThe other side of the coin, though, is we have been doing so little\u2014because of Republican opposition, mostly, to better train and prepare people who have been, really, either sidelined or whacked up in\u2014against their head by globalization.\nGlobalization is real, it's happening, it's having an impact. We don't have a good training program, we don't have the kind of support that people need to be able to move into positions where they can acquire new skills.\nAnd I see those two things as going together because we have to first and foremost focus on how we better prepare more Americans to be competitive in the global economy, and I don't think we've done that. I want to see that done alongside any trade agreement to a greater extent than the Republicans have been willing to support it.\nMODERATOR: Ma'am?\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, Amy Bondurant. So importantly, you've recommended that the U.S. lead the air coalition, and I wondered what next steps might be taken to ensure that that would happen.\nCLINTON: Well Amy, there's nothing magic or easy about putting together such a coalition. I know President Hollande will be coming to the United States to see President Obama this week, and I assume that there will be a group of French officials, defense officials, intelligence officials, homeland security officials who will be meeting with their American counterparts. And on the defense side, I think that certainly the United States working with France and then from that, you know, sort of hub beginning to reach out to other countries to seek out support. And I would go back to Arab countries as well. So looking for a way to begin the discussions about the negotiations that lead to the coalition as quickly as possible.\nYou know, going back to Libya, you know, the Europeans were the ones who wanted American support, and we did not agree to do so until we had a very clear idea what they were willing to do. And then we reached out and worked with the Arab League so that there would be Arab partners as well, and that took weeks. It wasn't something that just happened overnight. But it is definitely doable if we begin, I think, with the French-American position and move out from there.\nMODERATOR: [off-mike]\nQUESTION: Terry Whitney, Castle. My understanding was with regard to U.S. support for Syrian rebels over the last year or two, one of the main restraints was that they could not fight Assad directly and that this was a severe limitation and part of the reason the plan didn't work. When you recommend supporting additional training for Syrian rebel groups, would you advise them to allow them to fight Assad, or is that a part of the conflict that we don't want to get involved in?\nCLINTON: Well, back in the first term when Leon Panetta and Dave Petraeus and I made our recommendation about vetting and arming Syrian moderate rebels, the target was Assad, it was to defend themselves and be able to prevent the military taking over territory and creating the kind of humanitarian disaster that obviously we've all seen. So that was what we recommended back in the first term.\nSince then, I know it's been a very difficult task for the\u2014our government to take on and pursue successfully, but one of the challenges has been trying to draw lines, and you draw lines because you want to be able to vet and follow what happens to the arms that you are equipping people with.\nBut what happened to some of the few groups that have been trained is that they were quickly overrun by much more hardened fighters who were fighting Assad, so it was a\u2014it was a very hard task to do, two or three years later. I think it might have been, but again, I have said many times, I can't predict sitting here what would have happened if we moved earlier.\nIt might have worked, it might not have worked. But you can't really take Syrians who are rebelling against Assad, and tell them they can't use their training and their weapons against the person who, as I said my speech, has killed far more Syrians than ISIS has to date.\nQUESTION: Let me ask a follow-up on that, Madam Secretary, if the only way you can put together a moderate Syrian force is by having the United States cajole, bribe, arm and train it, we are then looking for this force to defeat ISIS, then defeat Assad, then defeat al-Nusra, then defeat other Al Qaida affiliates, keep at bay the Shiite militias and Hezbollah, take control of Damascus and establish a pluralistic democracy in Syria.\nIsn't that kind of a tall order? [laughter]\nCLINTON: Well, certainly, described like that. And that's why I focused on ISIS. I mean, because I think it's\u2014I think right now, we have one overriding goal. As I outlined, we need to crush their territorial domain, and we need to try to secure the entire border between Syria and Turkey.\nThere is not going to be a successful military effort at this point to overturn Assad. That can only happen to the political process, so our efforts should be focused on ISIS, and yes, there are other terrorist groups, al-Nusra, whom you mentioned, is that particularly lethal fighter.\nQUESTION: So, no fight against Assad for now?\nCLINTON: There\u2014we have to prioritize, and we had an opportunity, perhaps, I won't say that it would've worked. But right now, we've got the Russians in protecting Assad, the Iranians and Hezbollah protecting Assad.\nWe need to get people to turn against the common enemy of ISIS, and then we need to figure out how we put together a political outcome that provides enough autonomy, so that the separate communities within Syria will be able to re-create a Syrian state, even though it probably is unlikely it will be controlled by the Alawites from Damascus the same way it was before the civil war started.\nQUESTION: There is policy here, but there is also politics. There are, inescapably, people trying to appear tough and tougher.\nIf there were, God forbid, another terrorist attack, God forbid, in the United States, do you think the pressure to send American troops into Syria would be unstoppable?\nCLINTON: Well, it would certainly grow, but I think it would be a mistake.\nLook, as I said, we should be sending more special operators, we should be empowering our trainers in Iraq, we should be, you know, leading an air coalition, using both fighter planes and drones.\nWe have a lot of work to do to be able to really decimate ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. But we've got to work with the Kurds on both sides of the border, we have got to figure out how to, if possible, have a second Arab Awakening in Anbar Province, get the Sunni tribes to feel that it is their fight again, as they once did.\nAnd that requires a lot of political pressure being put on Baghdad. Injecting some large contingent of American forces complicates that, in my opinion. Right now, we need to keep the pressure on the people on the ground, and get them to change their priorities and work together.\nMODERATOR: Final question.\nQUESTION: Jim Ziren , Madam Secretary. Hi. Back to the no-fly zone. are you advocating a no-fly zone over the entire country or a partial no-fly zone over an enclave where refugees might find a safe haven? And in the event of either, do you foresee see you might be potentially provoking the Russians?\nCLINTON: I am advocating the second, a no-fly zone principally over northern Syria close to the Turkish border, cutting off the supply lines, trying to provide some safe refuges for refugees so they don't have to leave Syria, creating a safe space away from the barrel bombs and the other bombardments by the Syrians. And I would certainly expect to and hope to work with the Russians to be able to do that.\nYou know, the Russians have, as you know, then I primarily focused on Assad's enemies and not on ISIS. I think that has changed, and there is an indication that has changed. After Hollande comes here, he's going to go to Moscow to see Putin, and I\u2014and as I said earlier, I think getting Russia to play a role in that and getting Assad to understand that what happens to him will be a result of a political resolution, which Secretary Kerry is undertaking right now, but to have a swath of territory that could be a safe zone both for Syrians so they wouldn't have to leave but also for humanitarian relief. And I think that it would give us this extra leverage that I'm looking for in the diplomatic pursuits with Russia with respect to the political outcome in Syria.\nMODERATOR: We can take one last brief question. Ma'am?\nQUESTION: Thank you. (Inaudible.) My question relates to Saudi Arabia. Do you think that the goals that you outlined in the Middle East can be achieved without more cooperation from Saudi Arabia? And if not, how do you think [inaudible] can be convinced to change course?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that that the Saudis are critical to achieving the goals, and, you know, the Saudis are now engaged in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is leading, they're in the same process as the Iranians, which is something that was hard to get to but finally achieved. And I think that the Saudis have a multiple level of responsibilities, first and foremost, stopping their own citizens from continuing the financing for extremists.\nAnd, you know, Saudi financing is still a major source of revenue for terrorist groups inside Syria, inside Iraq elsewhere.\nMODERATOR: Including\u2014including ISIS, you think?\nCLINTON: I have no evidence of that, but there\u2014ISIS has become quite a self-financing terrorist network with their theft of oil, selling it on the black market with their destruction and seizure of antiquities, selling that on the black market, with their taking over Mosul and raiding the banks. They've got a source of funding, so I don't really know. But I know that the\u2014that Saudi individuals have certainly funded other related terrorist groups over time and also exported a lot of Wahhabi radicalism by kicking out or sending out imams and teachers to set up schools and mosques to preach that particularly harsh brand of Islam.\nSo the Saudis have a lot that they can do to both stop and then to help. And that's why I said, look, they are legitimately concerned about a takeover in Yemen that butts up against their border.\nAnd so, that is why they are expending a lot of money and a lot of military resources, trying to beat back the Houthis, trying to reestablish Hadian government. They have got a lot going on there.\nBut I would hope to draw them into a broader reading of what's going on in the region. And you know, for a lot of people, the Sunni-Shia sectarian divide is one of the major reasons for what's happening there.\nIt's understandable, but the Saudis need to have a broader view, and looking at Iran's influence inside Syria, their growing influence in Iraq as well as in Yemen, they need to understand they have to help us stabilize at least Northern Syria to start with, while trying to come up with some resolution of the Civil War.\nAnd I hope they will be more willing to be involved.\nMODERATOR: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for giving us your time. [applause]\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n","5":"\nThank you Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cummings, members of the committee. The terrorist attacks at our diplomatic compound and later, at the CIA post in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 took the lives of four brave Americans: Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.\nI am here to honor the service of those four men, the courage of the Diplomatic Security agency and the CIA officers who risked their lives that night, and the work their colleagues do every single day all over the world.\nI knew and admired Chris Stevens. He was one of our nation's most accomplished diplomats. Chris's mother liked to say that he had sand in his shoes, because he was always moving, always working, especially in the Middle East that he came to know so well.\nWhen the revolution broke out in Libya, we named Chris as our envoy to the opposition. There was no easy way to get him into Benghazi to begin gathering information and meeting those Libyans who were rising up against the murderous the dictator Qadhafi, but he found a way to get himself there on a Greek cargo ship, just like a 19th century American envoy. But his work was very much 21st century hard-nosed diplomacy.\nIt is a testament to the relationships that he built in Libya that on the day following the awareness of his death, tens of thousands of Libyans poured into the streets in Benghazi. They held signs reading \"thugs don't represent Benghazi or Islam.\" \"Sorry people of America, this is not the behavior of our Islam or our Prophet.\" \"Chris Stevens, a friend to all Libyans.\"\nAlthough I didn't have the privilege of meeting Sean Smith personally, he was a valued member of our State Department family. An Air Force veteran, he was an Information Management officer, who had served in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague.\nTyrone Woods and Glen Doherty worked for the CIA. They were killed by mortar fire at the CIA's outpost in Benghazi, a short distance from the diplomatic compound. They were both former Navy SEALs and trained paramedics with distinguished records of service, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAs Secretary of State, I had the honor to lead and the responsibility to support nearly 70,000 diplomats and development experts across the globe.\nLosing any one of them, as we did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, Haiti, and Libya during my tenure, was deeply painful for our entire State Department and USAID family, and for me personally.\nI was the one who asked Chris to go to Libya as our envoy. I was the one who recommended him to be our Ambassador to to the President.\nAfter the attacks, I stood next to President Obama as Marines carried his casket and those of the other three Americans off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base.\nI took responsibility. And, as part of that, before I left office, I launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.\nWhat happened in Benghazi has been scrutinized by a nonpartisan, hard-hitting Accountability Review Board, seven prior Congressional investigations, multiple news organizations, and, of course, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\nSo today I would like to share three observations about how we can learn from this tragedy and move forward as a nation.\nFirst, America must lead in a dangerous world, and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places.\nThe State Department sends people to more than 270 posts in 170 countries around the world.\nChris Stevens understood that diplomats must operate in many places where our soldiers do not, where there are no other boots on the ground, and safety is far from guaranteed. In fact, he volunteered for just those assignments.\nHe also understood we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security, and that we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values.\nAnd make no mistake: the risks are real. Terrorists have killed more than sixty-five American diplomatic personnel since the 1970s and more than a hundred contractors and locally employed staff.\nSince 2001, there have been more than one hundred attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.\nBut if you ask our most experienced ambassadors, they'll tell you they can't do their jobs for us from bunkers.\nIt would compound the tragedy of Benghazi if Chris Stevens' death and the death of the other three Americans ended up undermining the work to which he and they devoted their lives.\nWe have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.\nThat's why Chris was in Benghazi. It's why he had served previously in Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jerusalem during the second intifada.\nNobody knew the dangers of Libya better \u2013 a weak government, extremist groups, rampant instability. But Chris chose to go to Benghazi because he understood America had to be represented there at that pivotal time.\nHe knew that eastern Libya was where the revolution had begun and that unrest there could derail the country's fragile transition to democracy. And if extremists gained a foothold, they would have the chance to destabilize the entire region, including Egypt and Tunisia.\nHe also knew how urgent it was to ensure that the weapons Qadhafi had left strewn across the country, including shoulder-fired missiles that could knock an airplane out of the sky, did not fall into the wrong hands. The nearest Israeli airport is just a day's drive from the Libyan border.\nAbove all, Chris understood that most people, in Libya or anywhere, reject the extremists' argument that violence can ever be a path to dignity or justice. That's what those thousands of Libyans were saying after they learned of his death. He understood there was no substitute for going beyond the Embassy walls and doing the hard work of building relationships.\nRetreat from the world is not an option. America cannot shrink from our responsibility to lead. That doesn't mean we should ever return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, a foreign policy that puts boots on the ground as a first choice rather than a last resort. Quite the opposite.\nWe need creative, confident leadership that harnesses all of America's strengths and values. Leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.\nAnd at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like Chris Stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a country\u2014our country\u2014because they believed \u2013 as I do \u2013 that America is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known.\nMy second observation is this: We have a responsibility to provide our diplomats with the resources and support they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible.\nAfter previous deadly attacks, leaders from both parties and both branches of government came together to determine what went wrong and how to fix it for the future. That's what happened during the Reagan administration, when Hezbollah attacked our embassy. They killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. And then in a later attack, attacked our Marine barracks and killed so many more. Those two attacks in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 258 Americans.\nIt's what happened during the Clinton administration when al Qaeda bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than two hundred people, wounding more than two thousand people, and killing twelve Americans. It's what happened during the Bush administration after 9\/11.\nPart of America's strength is we learn, we adapt, and we get stronger.\nAfter the Benghazi attacks, I asked Ambassador Thomas Pickering, one of our most distinguished and longest-serving diplomats, along with Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by President George W. Bush, to lead an Accountability Review Board. This is an institution that the Congress set up after the terrible attacks in Beirut. There have been eighteen previous Accountability Review Boards. Only two have ever made any of their findings public. The one following the attacks on our embassies in East Africa and the one following the attack on Benghazi. The Accountability Review Board did not pull a single punch. They found systemic problems and management deficiencies in two State Department bureaus.\nAnd the Review Board recommended twenty-nine specific improvements. I pledged that by the time I left office, every one would be on the way to implementation. And they were. More Marines were slated for deployment to high-threat embassies. Additional Diplomatic Security agents were being hired and trained.\nAnd Secretary Kerry has continued this work. But there is more to do. And no administration can do it alone. Congress has to be our partner, as it has been after previous tragedies.\nFor example, the Accountability Review Board and subsequent investigations have recommended improved training for our officers before they deploy to the field. But efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better.\nFinally, there is one more observation I'd like to share:\nI traveled to 112 countries as Secretary of State. Every time I did, I felt great pride and honor representing the country that I love. We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. Leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology.\nOur nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security. Not that we always agree \u2014 far from it \u2014 but we do come together when it counts.\nAs Secretary of State, I worked with the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass a landmark nuclear arms control treaty with Russia. I worked with Republican Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to open up Burma, now Myanmar, to find democratic change.\nI know it's possible to find common ground, because I have done it.\nWe should debate on the basis of fact, not fear. We should resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those with who we disagree.\nSo I am here. Despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas, I am here to honor those we lost and to do what I can to aid those who serve us still.\nAnd my challenge to you, members of this Committee, is the same challenge I put to myself.\nLet's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead. To learn the right lessons. To rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship.\nThat's what I tried to do every day as Secretary of State. And it's what I hope we all strive for here today and into the future. Thank you.\n","6":"\nTAPPER: We have got another exclusive interview for you good people this morning, this one with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, fresh off a widely lauded debate performance watched by a record-setting 15 million people, enough to put her back on top in New Hampshire, according to one poll, where Bernie Sanders had pulled ahead of her in recent months.\nWe met up with Clinton in the Granite State.\nSo, congratulations on this new poll number in New Hampshire showing that you're pulling ahead of Bernie Sanders in a state where you have lagged a little. He's from neighboring Vermont\u2014the reviews obviously very positive from many pundits.\nI'm wondering what the pundit in chief, your husband... [laughter] ...who was in Vegas, I'm wondering what he said to you after the debate.\nCLINTON: He thought I did a really good job. And I think that's the highest praise that I can ever get, because there's nobody who\u2014whose opinion on these kinds of things I respect more.\nIt was great to have him with me. We had just celebrated our 40th anniversary on Sunday last. So, the fact that he could come and keep me company and keep my spirits up and, you know, drill me on some of the things he thought were important meant a great deal to me.\nTAPPER: As long as you bring it up, 40 years of marriage.\nCLINTON: Forty years, Jake, 40 years. [laughter]\nTAPPER: How\u2014how\u2014what do you know about him now that you didn't know 40 years ago?\nCLINTON: I am so grateful that we have basically had the opportunity to grow in so many different ways.\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you or your viewers that it's been a path filled with rose blossoms. It's been challenging. But, overall, looking back at those 40 years, I am so grateful that, after he asked me twice, I finally said yes and have spent these years with him.\nTAPPER: Turning to the debate, you said at the debate that you're a progressive, but you're a progressive that likes to get things done.\nSanders has plans that I think might be fairly called more ambitious than yours, in terms of expanding Medicare for everybody, basically single-payer health care, free college tuition, an across-the-board expansion of Social Security benefits. Do you think he's being unrealistic when he makes these proposals, in terms of what can actually get passed through Congress?\nCLINTON: Look, I have the highest regard for Senator Sanders. And I think he is raising issues that the electorate, not just Democrats, everybody needs to be thinking about.\nAnd he has put forward his plans with passionate intensity. And I have put forth mine. And just think of the difference between us and the Republicans, who have put forth nothing but the same old out-of-touch, out-of-date policies.\nTAPPER: But why are his plans more ambitious? Is it...\nCLINTON: Well, his\u2014he has a very ambitious and expansive view about what he thinks should be done with respect to free college and other of the policies that we both are trying to tackle.\nI believe that my approach, for example, on college, I call it the New College Compact, because I think everybody should have some skin in the game, including students, who I say should work for part of their education. Maybe it's because I did and my husband did, but I think it's something that you want young people to feel really committed to.\nIt's a difference in approach. We will have an opportunity, as these debates go forward, to really dig down. And I'm hoping that whatever network hosts them, whoever the moderator happens to be, that they will really ask us to explain and contrast.\nBut it's a policy difference. I mean, you could see on that stage in Las Vegas how we are maybe approaching these problems with different solutions, but we're both seeing the pressures that American families are under and the challenges that they're facing that we want to try to address.\nAnd the differences between us is nothing like the differences we all have with the Republicans. And I want the American people to be part of the debate, and to hear Senator Sanders' perspective and what he's proposing, to hear mine, to make up their mind, and then to remember that we're not peddling the same old failed policies of trickle-down economics and let the corporations do what they want and cut taxes on the wealthy, which is the answer to everything that the Republicans put forth.\nTAPPER: Speaking of the next debate, you have said in the past that Vice President Biden should have\u2014should take his time, whatever he needs, to make his decision about whether or not to run.\nBut your campaign is now signaling that it might be time for him to make a decision. Your top adviser John Podesta said this week\u2014quote\u2014\"I think the time has come for a decision.\"\nHas the time come?\nCLINTON: Well, that's up to Vice President Biden. Obviously, I have...\nTAPPER: That's your top adviser.\nCLINTON: Well, and I think what John was saying is that, whether you are encouraging or not, there does come a point where a decision has to be made.\nBut, certainly, I'm not in any way suggesting or recommending that the vice president accept any timetable, other than the one that is clicking inside of him. He has to make this decision.\nTAPPER: At the debate, you were asked to name the enemy of which you were most proud. [laughter] Among your answers were Republicans. That's about half the country, Republicans.\nCLINTON: Well, it was a little tongue-in-cheek.\nBut it's clear, I think, to anybody who's been around for a while that, you know, they do seem to enjoy coming after me. But then, once I'm in office, they have always worked with me. And I expect it will be exactly the same.\nIt's funny to me. When I was secretary of state, I had very high support and approval from Republicans, not just the Republican voters, but Republican officeholders. As soon as I got into this presidential election, you know, all of that collapsed again.\nAnd I'm just reminding people that, you know, you can be an adversary in politics, but then you do have to come together and figure out how to solve problems.\nTAPPER: You're talking a lot at the debate and on the stump about further restrictions on gun ownership, gun control.\nCLINTON: Mm-hmm.\nTAPPER: I remember, in 2008, during the primaries, you were positioning\u2014positioning yourself to the right of President Obama, or then-Senator Obama, on this issue. You talked about respecting how guns are part of the culture, sending out a mailer criticizing then-Senator Obama for pushing tougher gun laws.\nBut now you're coming at Bernie Sanders on this issue from the left. Did something change, or is it just about who you're running against?\nCLINTON: No, not at all. In fact, I would characterize what happened in '08 very differently.\nI spent a lot of years in Arkansas. I have a lot of experience with and respect for people who own guns, collect guns, use them for hunting, use them for target shooting. I respect the Second Amendment. I was taught to shoot by my dad when I was a girl. I have gone hunting. I get that.\nAnd I don't in any way want to denigrate those responsible gun owners, who have rights under the Second Amendment and our laws. But I believe we have gone way too far in being intimidated by the NRA. And I have said repeatedly that the majority of Americans and the majority of gun owners support universal background checks.\nAnd for the NRA to take these absolute positions on behalf of the most extreme of their members and carrying water for gun manufacturers and dealers is just wrong.\nSo, I don't think I have moved at all. I do have more experience perhaps than some in living in places. I represented Upstate New York, which is a big, vast rural area with small towns and cities. So, I get why people who are part of gun ownership are very proud of that.\nBut what I don't get is why we can't have sensible gun safety measures to keep guns out of the hands of fugitives and stalkers and felons and people with serious mental illness and domestic abusers, the people who should not have them in the first place.\nTAPPER: \"The New Yorker\" this week published a memo about you, about how to defeat you, by then-Senator Obama's campaign, including your current pollster, who I don't know if has talked to you about this. [laughter]\nCLINTON: I haven't seen him. [laughter]\nTAPPER: But, in any case, among other things, the memo said that you are driven by politics, not conviction, and you're constantly shifting, dodging and changing positions to satisfy the politics of the moment.\nThat's kind of the same rap on you from your opponents now. Do you reject it outright? Or do you see why some people might feel that way?\nCLINTON: Well, I can see why people try to come up with ways of attacking me. That seems to be part of the landscape. It happened when I ran for the Senate. It happened obviously again when I ran for president.\nBut I have been the same person. I have the same values. I have the same principles. There isn't anybody, anybody that I know in politics who hasn't changed a position from time to time, except some Republicans who are impervious to evidence and changed circumstances.\nSo, I really don't pay much mind to that. I'm sure we had some memo somewhere pointing out things that we tried to go after. But that's politics. I get it. But I think anyone who looks at what I have fought for and stood for my entire adult life, on behalf of kids and families and women and the middle class and economic opportunity, knows that I have been very steady.\nAnd, yes, do I look at evidence and try to figure out what's the best way forward to achieve the goals that I hold? Yes, I do, do that.\nTAPPER: Speaking of politics, let's talk about the front-runner on the other side of the aisle, Donald Trump.\nHis daughter Ivanka just gave an interview to CNN. She said her dad\u2014quote\u2014\"is not a politician, but he's really changing the dialogue and he's really disrupting the process in a very positive way.\"\nDo you agree?\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I have a really high regard for her. She is a wonderful young woman.\nTAPPER: And a friend of Chelsea's, I think.\nCLINTON: Yes, she is.\nAnd I think what she said is borne out by what's been happening. He has brought his oversized personality and his reality television experience to the highest level of American politics, and seems to be getting a very positive response among a large part of the Republican electorate.\nSo, that's up to the Republicans. They have to decide if that will be their nominee or not. I have called him out on some of the things that he has said which I thought were uncalled for, some of the insults and the attacks that he's made on immigrants, on women.\nAnd it's just unacceptable, what he let be said about the president. So, I'm going to continue to criticize him for going beyond the bounds of what I think is appropriate for anybody running for president.\nTAPPER: Stay with us. We're going to take a very quick break.\nComing up: what Clinton is expecting this week with the congressional committee she calls a partisan sham.\n[begin video clip]\nCLINTON: But I don't really know what their objective is right now.\n[end video clip]\n[commercial break]\nTAPPER: Hillary Clinton heads to Congress Thursday to appear before the committee investigating the Benghazi attacks. I asked her about it in our exclusive interview.\nYou're scheduled to testify before the Benghazi committee and the House of Representatives in a few days. What are you expecting and how are you preparing?\nCLINTON: I really don't know what to expect. I think it's pretty clear that whatever they might have thought they were doing they ended up becoming a partisan arm of the Republican National Committee with an overwhelming focus on trying to\u2014as they admitted, drive down my poll numbers.\nI already testified about Benghazi. I testified to the best of my ability before the Senate and the House. I don't know if that I have very much to add. This is after all, the eighth investigation. Other committees of the Congress, standing committees with very experienced members and staff have all looked into this and basically just rejected the conspiracy theories that are still floating out there in some circles. So I really don't know.\nI will do my best to answer their questions, but I don't really know what their objective is right now.\nTAPPER: I covered the Benghazi situation, the Benghazi tragedy when I was a White House correspondent and there's something I just never really understood and that is why did the State Department deny all those security requests?\nThe former regional security officer in Libya Eric Nordstrom recalled in testimony asking for 12 new security agents and he was talking to a regional director who said he was asking for the sun, the moon, and the stars. It got so bad Nordstrom said, that he said that he was fighting members of the State Department. It was like having the Taliban on the inside of the building.\nCLINTON: Well, the accountability review board that I commissioned went into this in great detail, and they made some recommendations.\nTAPPER: I know, but I guess the question is why, though? Why didn't the security requests, why weren't they made?\nCLINTON: Well, that was left to the security professionals, Jake. And in the reports, the ones that have been done that were nonpolitical and independent in their efforts to try to sort this through I think concluded that the security professionals in the State Department had to look worldwide and had to make some tough decisions. That's why we don't inject politics into it. That has to be what the professionals are deciding. And there were a lot of different opinions and that's understandable. There's tough decisions that have to be made. So I can only point you to the very thorough review that several committees have done starting with the accountability review board that have gone into this in great deal and made recommendations about how we can better make those assessments. Not at the political level, because I don't think a secretary of state who may be there for four years or two years should be reaching down in and making those decisions, but we have to do a better job with the professionals charged with making the decisions so that the information can all be evaluated and the resources that are need can be asked for and deployed to the best extent.\nTAPPER: I know Bernie Sanders said that, quote, \"the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.\" But there are a lot of people who are not...\nCLINTON: Well\u2014\nTAPPER: ... including FBI officials looking into whether national security was comprised because of this server. And this is\u2014this is something else that is very confusing to me with all your experience why wouldn't you anticipate that over the course of four years handling very sensitive diplomatic negotiations, overseeing military interventions and surveillance why wouldn't you anticipate that something classified whether about North Korea, or Iran, or drones or an informant for the CIA that it\u2014that it wouldn't be e-mailed to you? And why wouldn't you consider that having it on your personal account with some server in Colorado might be a potential risk?\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, nothing and I will underscore nothing that I was sent or that I sent was marked classified.\nWe have a system in our government, in our State Department. It was there before I came in.\nTAPPER: Right.\nCLINTON: It has continued after I left where there are decisions made about what is classified information in real time and nothing was marked classified.\nTAPPER: The inspector general of the intelligence community said some of this stuff contained classified information when it was generated whether or not it was marked classify.\nCLINTON: Well, that is just a very strong difference of opinion. The State Department does not agree with that. And it is almost an impossible standard because we had two separate systems.\nWe had the unclassified systems, so anybody who was on the unclassified system with the State Department would only be able to tell if something were classified if it were marked classified. We dealt with classified information on a totally different system. Nobody had access to that from an unclassified device. So, I think a lot of this is being a public display of the very common arguments that go on between different agencies and our government. This happens every time there is a Freedom of Information Act request. If something is going to be made public that was not classified at the time, maybe something has happened years later that there's a case and so now it's sensitive information. That's what's going on here. Different agencies are weighing in and saying, yes, it wasn't classified but we think that there is something in it that now we're going to say is sensitive.\nYou know, at the time there was nothing marked classified. And that is the fact that hasn't changed ever since\u2014\nTAPPER: Right. And you said it was allowed, too.\nCLINTON: Yes, it was.\nTAPPER: Who allowed it?\nCLINTON: It was allowed under the rules of the State Department. And again\u2014\nTAPPER: So nobody signed off on it?\nCLINTON: No, no. It was allowed.\nYou know, one of my predecessors did the same thing. Others in our government have done the same thing at very high levels because the rules did change after I left the State Department. But at the time and in prior years the rules allowed it.\n","7":"\nTAPPER: So, congratulations on this new poll number in New Hampshire showing that you're pulling ahead of Bernie Sanders in a state where you have lagged a little. He's from neighboring Vermont\u2014the reviews obviously very positive from many pundits.\nI'm wondering what the pundit in chief, your husband...

If elected, you would inherit 5,500 U.S. troops still in Afghanistan. Can you pledge that you would get all of them out of Afghanistan by the end of your first or second term?\nCLINTON: You know, Jake, I think what you're seeing with President Obama is a perfect example of a leader who has strong convictions about what he would like to see happen but also pays attention to what's going on in the real world. And his decision is one that I agree with.\nI will not sit here today and say what I would do upon taking office because, again, we want to bring our troops home. We certainly don't want them engaged in on the ground combat. We want them to help support and train the Afghan army. And we want them to, you know, continue to work with the government of Afghanistan to try to help strengthen security for them.\nSo, I can't predict where things will be in January of 2017. But I support the president's decision.\nTAPPER: You're scheduled to testify before the Benghazi Committee in the House of Representatives in a few days. What are you expecting and how are you preparing?\nCLINTON: I really don't know what to expect.

This happens every time there is a Freedom of Information Act request.\nIf something's going to be made public that was not classified at the time, maybe something has happened years later that there's a case and so now, it's sensitive information.\nThat's what's going on here. Different agencies are weighing in saying, yes, it wasn't classified, but we think that there is something in it that now we're going to say is sensitive. At the time there was nothing marked classified. And that is the fact that hasn't changed.\nTAPPER: Right. And you said it was allowed too.\nCLINTON: Yes, it was.\nTAPPER: Who allowed it?\nCLINTON: It was allowed under the rules of State Department. Again\u2014\nTAPPER: So nobody signed off on it?\nCLINTON: No, no, it was allowed. You know, one of my predecessors did the same thing. Others in our government have done the same thing at very high levels, because the rules did change after I left State Department. But at the time and in prior years, the rules allowed it.\nTAPPER: But it never occurred to you when any of these e-mails coming in from Sid Blumenthal with very sensitive information\u2014\nCLINTON: Sid Blumenthal was not a government employee or official. It would be like you sending me something, Jake. If I thought it had some interest to it, I might forward it onto somebody.\nBut I would not expect you to be in a position to classify anything because you were not in that classification process. Neither was he. So, he sent me stuff that he heard from people. You know, he's an old journalist and thought it was of interest. Some of it I sent on, some I didn't. I kind of made the judgment at the time.\nIt was not in the category of anything that could be classified because it came from an outside nongovernment person passing on what somebody told somebody told him.\nAnd, look, I'm somebody who thinks the government and people who work in it should be open to getting information from different sources. I mean, you wrote a book about Afghanistan. If during the course of my being secretary of state, you had sent me an e-mail saying, look, I think the government needs to know this, and I thought, hey, that's a good point I'll send it on and six years later they say, oh, my gosh, he was reporting sensitive information. Well, you didn't know that. And I certainly didn't know that.\nSo, I think that this is a complicated issue for even sophisticated folks to understand. And I just keep going back to we have two different systems. I dealt with classified information very carefully and seriously.\nI usually met with people to discuss it. It was delivered to me in hard copy so marked. And then when I traveled, I had one of those tents because we were afraid of prying eyes from certain governments that I would read classified material in. So, I'm very familiar with the importance of treating classified information as it should be with great care.\nTAPPER: Can I get your e-mail address?\nCLINTON: Sure. You want to send me something that might be interesting?\nTAPPER: I'm just wondering for the future. I haven't had that kind of relationship with you, but if that was like a hidden offer.\nCLINTON: Yes, sure. You can give me, you know, what you hear politically. I might make use of it.\nTAPPER: Sure. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for your time. I really appreciate it.\nCLINTON: Great. Nice to talk to you.\nTAPPER: Congratulations on the debate.\nCLINTON: Tank you. Thank you very much.\n","8":"\nSHARPTON: First of all, thank you for joining us. What will distinguish a Hillary Clinton presidency if elected from a Barack Obama president?\nCLINTON: I think where we are today is due in large measure to the tough decisions that President Obama had to make. I really like to take people back through the history and point out that, when President Obama took office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, and we could have literally fallen into a great depression, not just a great recession. And because of the hard work of the American people and the president's leadership, we got out of that big ditch. So we are standing again.\nBut now we have to build on what we've accomplished. We have to raise incomes. People are not seeing the results of that recovery in their pockets yet and that's something the president and I have talked about a lot. We have to continue and win the fight to raise the minimum wage because it's disgraceful the people that work full time in America are still in poverty.?\nWe have to win the fight on equal pay for equal work for women. We have to incentivize more profit sharing so the productivity that leads to profitability doesn't just all show up in the paychecks of CEOs but is shared broadly. And then of course we have to continue the fight against climate change, create millions of new jobs from clean renewable energy and have an infrastructure program. I like an infrastructure bank that will put more people to work.\nSo we have a very robust agenda that builds on top of layers on top of the progress that we have made under President Obama. And the worst thing that could happen to our country, in my opinion, is for the Republicans to rip away that progress and to do a big U-turn back to trickle-down economics to slam the door in the face of hard working people, whether it's working women or minorities of any sort or the LGBT community, to basically begin to marginalize and you know, dismiss the contributions of so many of our fellow Americans.\nSHARPTON: In 2008, president, now President Obama then senator Obama got 18 million votes. You did as well. What do you say to the eight million that didn't vote for you in 2008, why they should support Hillary Clinton now?\nCLINTON: Well, they are coming to me. I mean, the amount of support I have from people who supported then senator Obama in my race against him in 2008 and then others who have been supporting him ever since is really very gratifying to me. A lot of people are very appreciative of the work I did as secretary of state. They view the fact that I joined the cabinet as the senior cabinet member for my former opponent which I think is what you're supposed to do in our country was a very important statement of values about who we are and our democracy and how we get things done.\nSo I think the number of people both in my campaign and on the ground, around the country who are supporting me who were first and foremost supporters of President Obama speaks very well to their understanding of how hard this job is and how they need to elect somebody, a Democrat, who can build on the successes of the Obama presidency, and that's what I am pledged to do.\nYou know, everywhere I go to speak around the country, I talk about the mess that President Obama inherited from his Republican predecessors, not unlike although much worse than what my husband inherited from his Republican predecessors. And what I say is I'm not running for President Obama's third term or for Bill Clinton's third term. I'm running for my first term. But I know what works and I know how important it is to stand up for our values, to stand up for our interests and our security in a way that makes sense which is smart.\nSo people who have supported President Obama are, you know, very enthusiastic and I'm grateful for that in support of my candidacy.\nSHARPTON: The debates, the democratic debates s start on the 13th. How do you distinguish yourself from your opponent its, Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley without the theatrics we've seen on the Republican side. What is the distinguishing factors that you see between you and your opponent?\nCLINTON: I don't think there's any comparison between, we on the Democratic side and the Republicans. All of the Democrats are saying is we want to continue to improve the lives of hard working Americans. And we have different ways of going about it, about how we want to make college affordable, how we're going to deal with the affordable care act. We have differences, and that's what the debate will be about. But what I want viewers and voters to understand is that the real challenges to the progress we've made are coming from the Republican candidates.\nSo whatever differences we have on the Democratic side, which we will be exploring in the debate to give people a chance to make up their minds among us, it is really not at all the kind of gulf between us and the Republicans.\nSHARPTON: Any surprises that we can look for in the debate? Just between us.\nCLINTON: Just between us, well, you know, I don't know. You never know. I'm going to start kind of getting geared up and getting prepared. There are always surprises. You never know what you're going to be asked. You know that so well. And sometimes in the heat of the moment you might not know what you're going to say, but I'm looking forward to it. I think it will be terrific for our campaign.\nSHARPTON: There is always this looming question of whether vice president Biden is going to enter. Do you expect that he enters? And if he does, how will that, if at all, alter your strategy in terms of denomination?\nCLINTON: You know, I have said repeatedly that this is a very hard time for the vice president for all the obvious reasons any of us can understand. And he has to have the space and time to make up his mind about what he wants to do and I respect that. I don't comment on it. I want him to do whatever he thinks is right for him and his family.\nI'm going to run my campaign. I'm going to keep rolling out my policies. I'm going to keep standing up to the Republicans. I think they have really sort of showed their hand. They're really worried about running against me so they want to keep knocking me down. I kind of view that as a badge of respect actually, because they know that I will never give in to their, you know, very poor ideas about the economy or anything else. So I'm going to run my campaign and make my case to the American people.\nSHARPTON: The fact that you are running and we are seeing different polls say different things, Iowa, New Hampshire, can you lose Iowa and New Hampshire and still win? Is there a path?\nCLINTON: Well, that certainly has been the case in the past but I'm not going to lose. I'm going to work as hard as I can to make the case in the Iowa caucus and then in the New Hampshire primary. People didn't think I could win the New Hampshire primary last time after I didn't win the Iowa caucus.\nIt's very unpredictable. It is fast moving. But I think at the end of the day when I put forth, you know, my views about what the country should be doing and it is in conjunction with my experience and I think my ability, my determination, my tenacity to get things done, people will respond to that, caucus for me and vote for me.\nSHARPTON: I'm going to say two words to you, Donald Trump. What do you think?\n[commercial break]\nSHARPTON: I'm going to say two words to you, Donald Trump. What do you think?\nCLINTON: You know, Reverend Al, he has been stalking prejudice and paranoia. He has been really appealing to the worst instincts of human nature. I think it's dangerous, his demagoguery is no longer amusing.\nSHARPTON: He called you shrill.\nCLINTON: Well he has called me a lot of things. Now that he's running against me. Before he called me a great senator and great secretary of state. That's what a demagogue does, right? They say whatever they need to say to try to stir up the passions of people. So I hope that he is certainly, you know, someone who people begin to evaluate more carefully, but I will add this.\nA lot of what he has said has either been echoed or not repudiated by all of the other Republicans. He may be the flamboyant front-runner, but his views on immigration, his views on women, his views on Muslims, his views on a long list of issues are not that different from the either stated or unstated views of everybody on the Republican side.\nSHARPTON: Jeb Bush said in addressing an issue about why there weren't a lot of blacks at a particular gathering he was addressing, and he, among other things said, they were offered free stuff by Democrats, how do you respond to that?\nCLINTON: You know, I find that so insulting, so demeaning and condescending, it's the kind of language we've heard not only from Jeb Bush, we heard it from Mitt Romney. We're hearing it from Donald Trump. It's insulting in the most fundamental way because when we as Democrats say, hey, we want equal pay for equal work, we want to raise the minimum wage, we want to make sure people get the best education they can, that college is affordable, that's to build people up. That's to give everybody a chance to be successful in America.\nThere's nothing free about that. That's the way we're supposed to be working in our country, where we want people to live up to the God-given potential that they have. And for Republicans to keep saying that, driving edges, dismissing the legitimate aspirations, the talent and the hard work of Americans or anybody else in our country shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what America is and should be. It needs to be rejected. I don't hear any Republicans rejecting it. But, you know, I had a Facebook Q&A a few days ago. I was just outraged about it. And I'm outraged again when you ask me.\nSHARPTON: Let me bring you back. When you were a U.S. senator, you and I and others worked in New York around the [inaudible] case. And there are a lot of cases that has happened over the last year calling for police reform and calling for criminal justice reform. What would a president Hillary Clinton do to deal with the police reform question and to deal with the question that many of us are raising on how we have these matters looked at fairly and that families understand that they're getting a fair shot at justice?\nCLINTON: Absolutely. You know, first speech I gave in this campaign was at former mayor Dinkins' Colloquium at Columbia University. And I addressed systemic racism and failures of our justice system, and called for body cameras on every police officer, called for an end to mass incarceration. And I am continuing to talk about the issues. And I think that President Obama's policing commission has a good set of recommendations that I would certainly urge that we follow and implement.\nBut it's bigger than this, Al. I mean, the real problems go to how we see each other, how we treat each other, whether we're going to get back into respecting one another and that's especially true when you have police who are warrant to protect certain communities and they don't listen to those communities. They don't work with those communities.\nNow, the communities also have to respect the police. We understand that. But the initiative needs to come from changing a lot of the incentives in policing, changing the way police officers are trained, how they work. And I think with the policing commission that President Obama commissioned, we have good ideas on all of that, that shouldn't just sit on a shelf, we should be implementing.\nAnd I think that to a great extent, the movement for black lives matter has been essential in raising up these issue. A new generation has come to the forefront. I've met with some of them, I've certainly been made aware of all the meetings my staff has been having with a lot of the advocates, because we have to restore fundamental faith in our democracy and equal treatment under the law. And we know that doesn't exist right now. And that's a rebuke to all of us. And I'm going to do everything I can to restore trust and confidence and respect by changing behaviors and by holding them accountable, you know. We need to make sure that the civil rights division and the justice department is fully staffed and able to provide a clear look at any issue that needs to be referred to the federal government.\nSHARPTON: President Clinton, former president Clinton said at the NAACP that when he did the crime bill the Omnibus crime bill that maybe things went too far. And I remember as you know I was active then, a lot of people forget a lot of us wanted something hard because of limp bias and other things that were happening, crack, I was painting crack houses if you remember trying to expose them.\nHow do we deal with violence without adding to the mass incarceration? What would be the Clinton plan? We are seeing these shootings this week in Chicago.\nCLINTON: Right.\nSHARPTON: I mean, we've got to deal with this without feeding into where it went \"too far\" in the words of former president Clinton.\nCLINTON: Well, both you and he are right. You remember what we were facing in the 1980s and the early 1990s. And people of color, poor communities, lots of towns and cities, including this great city of New York, were under tremendous pressure because there was so much crime, gangs were warring in the streets, crack houses were endemic, crack babies were filling, you know, the wards of our hospitals. And so yes, we did have to take action.\nBut let's remember some of the things that were done that we no longer do. We had a ban on assault weapons. I want us to get back to sensible, smart gun prevention of violence. I want us to have not just universal background checks, but I want us to really have the country rise up against the special interests lobby of the NRA that believes anybody should have a gun, regardless of their past history, regardless of whether they're domestic violence abuser.\nThis is just unsustainable, and we need to stand against it and I'm willing to take them on. Because I know that guns are at the root of so much of the crime and the danger that stalks our neighborhoods.\nSecondly, we do have to weed out the most violent offenders, you know, the repeat offenders, the guys who have no regard for human life. But our prisons and jails are filled with people who have mental health challenges, people who have substance abuse challenges. They should not be in jail or prison. I want a much more robust diversionary program. I want us to do more on treatment. I think I may be the first presidential candidate at least in a long time who has a whole policy on substance abuse because this is at the root, you know. And so many people with anxiety, with depression, with other mental health problems, they self-medicate with alcohol and drugs, and oftentimes they get off track. We shouldn't punish them. We should help them.\nI also think that the police have to understand that a lot of what we tried to do back in the day, back in the 1990s and the Clinton administration was to build those relationships between police and community, not to be in two separate camps but to be part of the same effort, to protect citizens, particularly the elderly, particularly the young, to have enough policing that people could feel safe, but not so much that it oppresses people and makes them feel that they are being singled out.\nThis is a hard path to walk, but I know we can do it. We've learned lessons. We have a lot that we now know especially when it comes to imprisoning low level offenders is not necessary to prevent crime on the streets. Let's focus on the bad actors that we don't want setting up crack houses again that you have to go and try to close or joining gangs that are so deadly people are dying across the streets in the country.\nSHARPTON: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much for being with us this morning.\nCLINTON: That went by fast. Thanks again. Good to be with you.\nSHARPTON: Thank you. You and I work together on Sunday mornings usually in church.\nCLINTON: That's right. I'm glad you're doing this early enough so people can watch before they go to church.\nSHARPTON: That's right. Thank you.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n","9":"\nTODD: Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us.\nCLINTON: Thank you very much.\nTODD: And a reminder, I know there's all conspiracy theories out there, there are no limitations to this interview.\nCLINTON: As far as I know. That's true\u2014absolutely.\nTODD: Exactly. So let's get that out of the way.\nLet me start with a piece of sound, it's MEET THE PRESS, this is what you said on MEET THE PRESS seven years ago about transparency.\n[begin video clip]\nCLINTON: I want to have a much more transparent government and I think we now have the tools to make that happen. I want to have as much information about the way our government operates on the Internet. So the people who pay for it, the taxpayers of America, can see that.\n[end video clip]\nTODD: A year later, Clintonemail.com, this server\u2014started private server. Had every government agency did what you did at the State Department there would be a lot of information that wasn't in the public. Do you see that now as a problem as far as the public is concerned?\nCLINTON: Well, Chuck, let me make a couple points. First of all, as I have said very often, all of the e-mails that I sent were intended to be in the government systems if they were work related. That's why I sent them to people at their work a dresses. And, you know, the vast majority of them ended up there.\nSo I have said also that if I had to do it all over again I would have used a separate e-mail account. I did it for convenience and it turned out not to be that at all. But the bottom line is my e-mails were predominantly in the State Department system or on other government servers and then I said I'm going to give them all after a very careful review and I did so.\nTODD: All right. I want to unpack a couple of things there but let me start with just the news of this week. You had said in a written statement under oath that you had turned over everything that you believed you had for the federal records with those 55,000 e-mails but we have now discovered an e-mail chain between then General Petraeus and yourself that took place a couple of months before these records started.\nCan you explain the discrepancy there? It was the same e-mail address that you used while at state that you were using with General Petraeus just two months before you said everything was out there.\nCLINTON: Well, everything that we had access to was certainly out there and the reason we know about the e-mail chain with General Petraeus is because it was on a government server. And so from my perspective we have a very thorough review process that we conducted and my attorneys supervised it, they went through everything and what we had available at the time was turned over.\nTODD: But I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if you said in March that the e-mail system began in March of '09 yet but we have the same e-mail address popping up in January, explain that discrepancy.\nCLINTON: There was a transition period. I wasn't that focused on my e-mail account to be clear here.\nTODD: Let me stop you there. You say you weren't focused on it except this seemed to be\u2014to put an e-mail server at your house is not a\u2014it's a complicated thing.\nCLINTON: Yes, but it was already there. It had been there for years. It is the system that my husband's personal office used when he got out of the White House so it was sitting there in the basement. It was not any trouble at all. I know there are a lot of people who are questioning that.\nBut the fact is that it was there. I added my account to it. It apparently took a little time to do that and so there was about a month where I didn't have everything already on the server. We went back and tried to recover whatever we could recover.\nAnd I think it's also fair to say that there are some things about this that I just can't control. I can't control the technical aspects of it. I'm not by any means a technical expert. I relied on people who were and we have done everything we could in response to the State Department asking us to do this review because they asked all the former secretaries.\nAnd the reason they asked, Chuck, is because they found gaps in their own recordkeeping. You know, my assumption\u2014because this system was there before I became secretary\u2014it was there when I left\u2014my assumption was anything that I sent to a dot-gov account would be captured.\nTODD: But, you know, that's very difficult to capture all of your e-mails by going to perhaps thousands of people and their dot-gov accounts. It would have been easier if it was sent to your dot-gov account.\nCLINTON: Well, but when you communicate with people in other parts of the government you're not sending it to the State Department dot-gov and that would have been true either way. I think I have done all that I can to take responsibility to be as transparent as possibly in turning over 55,000 pages, in turning over my server and to testify on October 22, which I've been asking to do before the Congress.\nTODD: You had said just now in one of your explanations that you provided these records because State asked of all secretaries of state. As you know there was a report earlier this week in the \"Washington Post\" that said that isn't quite how it happened. In the summer of 2014 they discovered the discrepancy with your records and they wanted to make a request then it became a formal request of the last four secretaries of state. Can you explain that discrepancy?\nCLINTON: Well, we have explained that. The campaign has explained it.\nTODD: What is it?\nCLINTON: Look, when the committee\u2014the eighth or ninth committee\u2014investigating Benghazi asked for information from the State Department, they were doing a survey and they found discrepancies in their recordkeeping not in my records per se but in their overall recordkeeping. There were gaps and that's why they sent the letter and that's why we did the overall comprehensive search for everything.\nAnd it got us to the same place\u2014we looked through everything, we gave them everything work-related. In fact, we gave them so much they've already told us they're sending back 1,200 because they were clearly personal and not work related.\nTODD: Can you respond to an alternative explanation that has sort of\u2014\nCLINTON: Another conspiracy theory?\nTODD: That perhaps the reason you wanted to have a private server and not a government server is that Republicans have been coming after you for years, you might have\u2014may have been running for president in the future and you wanted to make it a little more difficult for congressional investigators to subpoena your government e-mails and a little more difficult for Freedom of Information Act requests. Is that a fair theory or no?\nCLINTON: It's totally ridiculous. That never crossed my mind. And in fact, since more than 90 percent of my work-related e-mails were on the system they are subject to FOIA or any other request. That's how the Benghazi Committee got the e-mails even before we went through our exhaustive process.\nNow I have\u2014as you're rightly pointing out\u2014been involved from the receiving side in a lot of these accusations. In fact, as you might remember during the 90s, there were a bunch of them and, you know, all of them turned out to be not true. That was the outcome.\nWhen I ran for the senate the voters of New York, they overlooked all of that, and they looked at my record, and they looked at what I would do for them and I was elected senator after going through years of this kind of back and forth. And it is regrettable but it's part of the system.\nTODD: You know, one of the things about this over the last six months that I've heard from supporters is that there's an allegation about your e-mail server. The campaign provides an explanation, you provide an explanation. There's a new allegation, you have to provide a new explanation. There's an addendum that had explanation\u2014it has the feel of a drip-drip-drip. Can you reassure Democrats that there's nothing else here?\nCLINTON: Well, it is like a drip-drip-drip and that's why I said there's only so much that I can control. But what I have tried to do in explaining this is to provide more transparency and more information than anybody that I'm aware of has ever served in the government and I'm happy to do that because I want these questions to be answered.\nI can't predict to you what the Republicans will come up with, what kind of charges or claims they might make. I have no control over that. I can only do the best I can to try to respond.\nThe Justice Department has the e-mails, they have the server. They're conducting a security inquiry. They will take whatever necessary steps are required to get this matter resolved.\nTODD: Can you say with 100 percent certain that the deleted e-mails that the FBI is not going to find anything in there that's going to cause you to have to explain again?\nCLINTON: All I can tell you is that when my attorneys conducted this exhaustive process I did not participate.\nTODD: Why?\nCLINTON: I didn't look at them.\nTODD: I would want to know what e-mails. Why wouldn't you want to know?\nCLINTON: I wanted them to be as clear in their process as possible. I didn't want to be looking over their shoulder. If they thought it was work-related it would go to the State Department. If not then it would not. As I just said, over 1,200 of the e-mails that we were overly inclusive in trying to be comprehensive the State Department has said we don't want these. These are personal. These aren't work related. They're sending them back.\nSo when that process finished, you know, my attorney said what do you want us to do with all these personal e-mails? I said I don't need to keep them. I don't need them or want them. So they then talked to the IT server, the technical people who were responsible for maintaining them and said we don't need them anymore.\nThat's the limit of my knowledge and I know I was a little sarcastic in one exchange with the press for which I\u2014I'm sorry guys. But you know, I'm not a technical expert. I just said I don't need them. Whatever happened to them happened to them and I'm very sure that my attorneys did the most meticulous job that could have been done.\nTODD: I'm just curious. Would anything having to do with the Clinton Foundation, would that have been personal or work?\nCLINTON: Well, it would depend. I did not communicate with the foundation. Other people in the State Department did in accordance with the rules that have been adopted.\nTODD: Any of these deleted e-mails are not going to be foundation related at all?\nCLINTON: Well, there might be, you know, there's going to be a meeting or there's this but not anything that relates to the work of the State Department. That was handled by, you know, the professionals and others in the State Department.\nTODD: All right. Let me sort of move on from that a little bit. I say sort of move on because obviously you've taken a hit in the polls.\nCLINTON: I have.\nTODD: There's the New Hampshire poll. Do you believe you have explained this and that there aren't any contradictions here? So is the issue not truthfulness but the issue of how you've handled it?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, let me say this Chuck. I have tried to the best of my ability to be able to respond and if people are uncertain, if they have concerns about these questions around the e-mails it's their choice to say that's going to influence, you know, how I think about the election. I understand that, I get it.\nBut I also hope people will look at my life long advocacy for kids and families and women and look at what I'm proposing, the vision I have for the country to move forward on everything from raising incomes to equal pay for equal work to getting the cost of college down to dealing with high prescription drug costs\u2014that's what I hope people focus on and people get to make their minds up. That's the beauty of our process. People can decide on whatever basis they choose.\nTODD: Your distrust deficit\u2014your husband did an interview on CNN and he basically put it all on the Republicans and a little bit of us on the press that this whole thing that has driven down your poll numbers. Do you bear any responsibility?\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I love my husband and he does get upset when I am attacked. I totally get that. But we also get the fact that, look, this is a contest and it's fair game for people to raise whatever they choose to raise. As he said I think in that same interview, they're not giving this job away, you have to get out there, you have to earn it. And that's what I'm trying to do.\nAnd of course I take responsibility. It was my choice. It was a mistake back when I did it and I'm trying to do the best I can to answer all of the questions that people have. And as I said during the 90s I was subjected to the same kind of barrage and it was\u2014it seemed to be at the time endless.\nAnd then when I ran for the Senate people said, hey, we are more concerned about what you're going to do for us. And I trust the voters to make that decision this time around, too.\nTODD: All right. I want to play a little comp we've put together of some of the positions where your positions have changed a little bit. Take a look.\n[begin video clip]\nCLINTON: So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interest of our nation.\nI've made it very clear that I made a mistake, plain and simple.\nI believe that marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman.\nThis morning love triumphed in the highest court in our land.\nWe've not yet signed off on it but we are inclined to do so.\nWe're either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the gulf or dependent on dirty oil from Canada.\nI oppose it. I oppose it because I don't think it's in the best interests of what we need to do to combat climate change.\n[end video clip]\nTODD: How do you respond to some critics who say your positions have changed out of political expediency? That you're sort of whatever the majority is at that time, that's the position you have.\nCLINTON: Well, I just don't think that reflects either my assessment of issues and I don't think it reflects how people who are thoughtful actually conduct their lives. I mean if we don't learn, if we don't, you know, make decisions based on the best information we have available, well, you know, that's regrettable. And what I've always tried to do is just say ok, what is the best decision that I can think about making?\nNow, with those that you did number one on the Iraq war vote, I've written about it, I've talked about it, I said it was a mistake. It certainly became a very clear mistake when you saw the way the Bush administration conducted that war and the decisions that they made. And so I have been very forthright in saying, you know, as I looked at what was happening it was a mistake.\nOn same-sex marriage, like a lot of people, including our president, I did evolve and I was not raised to even imagine this. And I'm thrilled now that it's the law of the land and I have a lot of good friends who are now able to be married because of the changes we've made legally and constitutionally.\nWhen it comes to Keystone, you know, I was at the beginning of the process of trying to evaluate what was the best outcome. I did feel that I shouldn't jump in before the President and Secretary Kerry and make my views known because they're still in the middle of that process.\nBut it was frankly uncomfortable to have so many people asking me and my saying I'm waiting and waiting and waiting and it still hasn't happened. I don't know when it will happen. It may have to happen when I'm president, I hope. So I've said I'm against it on the total evaluation.\nWhen I made that statement years ago we did not have the kind of energy profile we have. We did not have the full understanding of how the particular oil that would have been extracted from those tar sands was of a different degree of dirtiness and polluting in terms of greenhouse gases.\nSo I'm not going to sit here and tell people that I make up my mind\u2014that's the Republicans. They make up their mind, they're never bothered by evidence.\nTODD: But Bernie Sanders has been where you are on these issues. Bernie Sanders was there when it came to marriage 20 years ago. Do you think one of the reasons he's doing well right now is some progressives think, well, you know what? He was there when it wasn't popular.\nCLINTON: Well he can speak for himself and I certainly respect his views. I can just tell you that I am not someone who stakes out a position and holds it regardless of the evidence or regardless of the way that I perceive what's happening in the world around me.\nAs I was saying, that's where the Republicans are. They're still believing in trickle down economics even though it was a disaster not once but twice for our country. So I want people\u2014because I think my experience on these issues is much more reflective of how people talk to me about how they, too, have evolved and moved in their understanding and I feel very comfortable saying that.\nTODD: Well, I have a lot more questions and the good news is I have a part two interview we're going to do for the new show, my new show \"MTP DAILY\". So we will get into some foreign policy, domestic policy, a bunch of stuff.\nMadam Secretary, thanks for coming back to MEET THE PRESS.\nCLINTON: Thank you, glad to be here.\n","10":"\nDICKERSON: We're joined by Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Welcome, Secretary Clinton. We're glad to have you.\nLet's start in the news, Syrian refugees.\nCLINTON: Right.\nDICKERSON: President Obama has said he will increase the number allowed into 10,000. Is that enough?\nCLINTON: Now, look, we're facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II.\nAnd I think United States has to do more. And I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000, and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in, looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.\nBut I also want the United States to lead the world. And I have recommended that, at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly, there be an international meeting called by the secretary-general and literally get people to commit, putting money in, helping the front-line states, like Jordan and Turkey and Lebanon, who have absorbed a lot of refugees, working with the E.U. and the European countries, but getting everybody to make a contribution.\nDICKERSON: Let me ask you about the underlying condition creating this refugee crisis.\nYou advocated for arming the Syrian rebels.\nCLINTON: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nDICKERSON: That was then ultimately put in place. We now hear that that is not going well at all. Out of 12,000 Syrians that have been trained, there are only handful that can actually fight.\nWas this a bad idea, or was this a bad idea\u2014or was this a good idea poorly executed?\nCLINTON: Well, John, I did recommend that, at the beginning of this conflict, we do more to help train those who were in the forefront of leading the opposition against Assad, looking to try to bring the moderates together.\nA lot of these rebels, originally, they were\u2014they were businesspeople, they were professional people, they were students. They had no training in going up against the Syrian army, which Assad clearly was going to use to the ultimate effect. That was not the decision taken at that time.\nA lot of what I worried about has happened. There are now big ungoverned territories within Syria that are dominated by terrorist groups, ISIS being the best known, but not the only one. You have Iran and Russia increasingly moving in to support Assad and his constant bombardment against his own people.\nAnd then you have these millions of refugees. So, where we are today is not where we were. And where we are today is that we have a failed program. You heard the testimony, five people trained for half\u2014$500, half-a-billion dollars.\nBut I think we still have to keep working with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with others of our partners. We also have to do more to support the Kurds, something that I have also advocated.\nDICKERSON: Let me ask you about Russia.\nSo, it looks like U.S. policy now is, we're not going to\u2014train and equip has failed, so now we're going to turn to the Russians for help. These are the same Russians who are busy in Ukraine doing things we don't like them to do. The Israelis think that the Russians are involved with Hezbollah. Why are we turning to the Russians?\nCLINTON: Well, I hope we're not turning to the Russians.\nLet me just quickly say that I wouldn't give up on train and equip, but I sure would push the Pentagon to take hard look why what has been done has been such a failure and what more we could do to support, like, Kurdish fighters who are on the front lines.\nAnd one of the difficulties we had in the train and equip is that we basically were trying to train people to only take on ISIS and terrorist networks. We were not training and equipping them to take on Assad or his military or his proxies, which include Hezbollah, by the way.\nI hope we are not turning to the Russians in that way. I hope what we're doing\u2014and this is what I support\u2014and I heard Secretary Kerry say this is what we will be doing. And I think Secretary Carter has begun these conversations.\nFirst of all, we have to figure out what they are doing. Russia has a long interest in Syria. They have had a base in\u2014a naval base in Syria for a long time. They have a connection because a lot of Syrians were educated in the Cold War in Moscow and a lot of Russians actually moved to Syria.\nSo, they have not only deep links to Syria and Syrians, but they intend to support Assad for their own reasons. And we need to really unpeel what it is they're trying to accomplish and work with others to try to contain them.\nAnd I want to just end by saying, if they are providing any equipment to Hezbollah, if they are supporting Hezbollah, which is the main fighting force on behalf of the Iranians to support Assad, but also a deadly threat to Israel, then we have got to take action, whether there are tougher sanctions or other kinds of actions to try to prevent that from happening.\nDICKERSON: I want to ask you about something that came up in the Republican debate. Jeb Bush said, one thing was true about his brother. He kept America safe.\nDo you agree with that?\nCLINTON: I think it's a complicated question, because, of course, 9\/11 happened.\nI was a senator from New York. And I was basically consumed by my responsibility to help the people directly affected in my state and in the city.\nSo, it did happen. And then I do give President Bush credit for trying to bring the country together around the threats that we did face. I have said the war in Iraq was a mistake. I supported what happened in Afghanistan. So, if you sort it all out, you know, it's a mixed\u2014it's a mixed picture.\nDICKERSON: Let me take you back to the 2008 campaign, where Iraq was a conversation and U.S. security was a conversation.\nYou ran an ad, the 3:00 a.m. ad...\nCLINTON: Yes.\nDICKERSON: ... which became quite famous. Let's play that for our\u2014our viewers.\nCLINTON: My gosh. I haven't seen that in a long time. [laughter]\nDICKERSON: Well, it's a throwback Sunday here.\n[begin video clip]\nNARRATOR: It's 3:00 a.m., and your children are safe and asleep. Who do you want answering the phone?\nCLINTON: I'm Hillary Clinton. And I approve this message.\n[end video clip]\n[laughter]\nDICKERSON: So, the question for you is, now you have been secretary of state.\nCLINTON: Right.\nDICKERSON: Benghazi.\nCLINTON: Right.\nDICKERSON: Was that your 3:00 a.m. phone call? And how well did you handle that crisis, by the standard you raised in that ad?\nCLINTON: Well, of course it was a crisis. And we lost four brave Americans, including the person that I asked the president to send as ambassador, Chris Stevens.\nBut we live in a dangerous world. And even our diplomats are at threat. And that goes all the way back to, for goodness' sake, taking over our embassy in Tehran or the bombings of our embassy in Beirut, when President Reagan was in charge.\nThis is a dangerous world. And I think what we had to do during that period of time, in trying to protect our people after the attack on the consulate, getting them evacuated, not only working on what was going on in Libya, because, remember, we had embassies that were under attack or threatened to attack by terrorist groups across North Africa, indeed, across a much larger swathe of the world.\nSo, I think it was terribly tragic, what happened. I immediately asked for an independent review, just like former secretaries of state did. And I made that public. And the only other person who did that was Secretary Albright after our embassies were bombed in Africa.\nSo, my view on this is, we have to learn things. And we are always learning. We learned after Beirut. We learned after Tanzania and Kenya. We have learned after Benghazi, but we're not going to be able to represent the United States working out of hermetically sealed tanks. We are going to have to be out in the world.\nDICKERSON: One more question on Benghazi. The charge is, in this campaign, that after it happened, there was a report inside the State Department and inside the government that this was a terrorist attack.\nBut in what we heard from the government at the time and from you was an emphasis on this video, that that had created the attack. And so the charge is that there was a political pressure to make the case more about the video than to talk about terrorism.\nCLINTON: Well, I just don't think that's fair. And I'm going to testify about this at the end of October before the committee looking into this. I think it's the eighth investigation that the Congress has conducted.\nThere were two things going on simultaneously. I and others said that we were attacked. There was no doubt about that. That video, which was still spinning through the world, was being mentioned on social media. We had people climbing the walls at our embassy in Cairo even before the attack in Benghazi.\nAnd we had a lot of other attacks. I had to call the president of one of our neighboring countries, Tunis, to try to get\u2014in Tunis\u2014to get them to help protect our embassy. So, I was worried about everything that was going on and how people were responding to that from North Africa to Pakistan, all the way to Indonesia.\nDICKERSON: So, no political pressure to keep the story kind of a little more favorable to the administration?\nCLINTON: Well, all I can tell you, I never felt any political pressure or did I feel any political reason to do anything other than what we tried to do, which was to immediately deal with the problems that were coming at us.\nDICKERSON: So, questions about Benghazi have led to discovery of your personal server.\nIf we use this episode as a way to think about the way would you run your presidency, let's say there's a meeting at Clinton headquarters, and you're with your staff. And you're saying, looking at the e-mail situation from the day you decided, yes, to have the server, all the way to where we all now...\nCLINTON: Right.\nDICKERSON: ... what went well, what didn't go so well?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I have said that I didn't make the best choice.\nI should have used two separate e-mail accounts, one personal, one work-related. What I did was allowed. It was fully above board. People in the government certainly knew that I was using a personal e-mail.\nBut I have tried to be transparent. And that includes releasing 55,000 pages, which is unprecedented\u2014nobody else that I'm aware of has ever done that\u2014plus turning over the server, plus testifying at the end of October.\nSo, I think that people have questions. I want to try to answer them.\nDICKERSON: Was it a failure in judgment on your part?\nCLINTON: Well, look, it was permitted. It was allowed. I did it.\nAnd I think that people can make their own judgments about that. But I have tried to be as transparent as I can.\nDICKERSON: You talked a lot about transparency, that\u2014when we think about trust\u2014and there's been a lot of talk about that in your campaign and voters having questions. They have questions maybe related to this.\nTrust and transparency are related. You have been transparent in the release of these e-mails, but what about before? Because there was a period where you held on to the whole kit and caboodle before any investigators were asking for it, long after you were out of the State Department.\nCLINTON: Well, it wasn't that long. What I did was to send e-mails to people at their government accounts, which I had every reason to believe would be captured on the government systems.\nAnd when we were asked to help the State Department make sure they had everything from other secretaries of state, not just me, I'm the one who said, OK, great, I will go through them again. And we provided all of them. And more than 90 percent were already in the system.\nAnd, in fact, I gave so many that were not work-related, just to be as comprehensive as possible, they are already sending back about 1,200 of them.\nSo, look, I did what was, as I said, allowed. I said it wasn't the best choice. And it turned out to be a mistake, in retrospect. But, at the time, and given the fact that most of them were in the government systems, people are going to get a chance to see all kinds of behind-the-scenes conversations, most of which, I'm embarrassed to say, are kind of boring. [laughter]\nDICKERSON: Just to button this up here, you have said you were sorry.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nDICKERSON: What exactly are you sorry for and to whom?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, I'm sorry that I made a choice that has raised all of these questions, because I don't like reading that people have questions about what I did and how I did it.\nI'm proud of the work we did at the State Department. And I'm really proud of all the career professionals I worked with. I'm proud of the people who came in with me. And we got sanctions on Iran, put together that international coalition. We got a new arms treaty with Russia. We did a lot of really important work.\nAnd I want that to be the focus of what people know about my tenure at the State Department.\nDICKERSON: Some people who know you and have worked with you say what this e-mail situation suggests is that there's nobody around you who can say, Secretary Clinton, this is a bad idea, don't do this.\nDo you have such a person?\n[crosstalk]\n[laughter]\nCLINTON: I have too many, actually. Look, this\u2014this was...\nDICKERSON: No, before the fact, not after. After, everybody is giving you advice.\nCLINTON: I know.\nNo, but, John this was done by prior government officials, including...\nDICKERSON: But not at this level, not solely a server just for you.\nCLINTON: You know, look, let's\u2014it was done by others.\nAnd let me just say that, yes, when I did it, it was allowed, it was above board. And now I'm being as transparent as possible, more than anybody else ever has been.\nDICKERSON: All right.\nSecretary Clinton, we are going to pause right there.\nCLINTON: OK.\nDICKERSON: We will be back in one more minute with more from Secretary Clinton.\nStay with us.\n[commercial break]\nDICKERSON: We're back now with Secretary Clinton.\nSecretary Clinton, Donald Trump had a supporter at one of his rallies suggest the president was Muslim and not an American. Donald Trump stayed mute and continues to say nothing about that.\nAre politicians on the hook for every crazy thing one of their supporters stands up and says?\nCLINTON: Well, of course not, because we all have supporters who may say things that we don't agree with.\nBut when you are at an event and someone stands up and says something like that in front of you, then I do think you have a responsibility to respond.\nJohn McCain did back in the '08 campaign when somebody in one of his events said something similarly untrue and insulting about the president. And McCain stopped that person. That's what Donald Trump should have done.\nAnd I said the other day he is fueling a level of paranoia and prejudice against all kinds of people. And when you light those fires, you better recognize that they can get out of control. And he should start dampening them down and putting them out.\nHe wants to talk about what he would do as president. That's obviously fair game. But to play into some of the worst impulses that people have these days that are really being lit up by the Internet and other conspiracy-minded theories is just irresponsible. It's appalling.\n[crosstalk]\nDICKERSON: Which Republican would you like to run against the most?\nCLINTON: Oh, John, I have no\u2014I have no vote in that. I'm going to run against whoever they put up against me.\nDICKERSON: Are you doing anything to prepare for Joe Biden potentially entering the race? Is your campaign doing anything?\nCLINTON: No, we're not, because this is such a personal decision.\nAnd the vice president has to sort this out. He's been so open in talking about how difficult this time is for him and his family. And he's obviously considering what he wants to do, including whether he wants to run. And I just have the greatest respect and affection for him. And I think everybody just ought to give him the space to decide what is best for him and his family.\nDICKERSON: Bernie Sanders has made quite a point of not attacking you. He said he's not going to run any negative ads.\nWould you pledge to do the same thing with respect to him, not attack him, and also tell your supporters, hey, lay off?\nCLINTON: Look, I want this to be about ideas and about policies.\nI know Bernie. I respect his enthusiastic and intense advocacy of his ideas. That's what I want this campaign to be about. And I hope people who support me respect that, because this is a serious election. I obviously am running because I think it's better for the country if a Democrat who has the kind of approaches and values that my husband had and Barack Obama has follows this presidency.\nDICKERSON: So, can I mark that down as a yes?\nCLINTON: Yes.\nDICKERSON: You will pledge not to?\nCLINTON: Well, I have no\u2014no interest in doing that.\nDICKERSON: And you're going to talk about Obamacare this week, support it.\nCLINTON: Yes, I am.\nDICKERSON: What is the big new proposal you're going to offer?\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me say that it's time that we say that the debate over the Affordable Care Act is over. The Supreme Court has twice upheld it, yet the Congress has voted more than 50 times to repeal it.\nLet's get beyond that. Enough is enough. And we need to strengthen it, not scrap it. It is the core of how we're going to provide health care to Americans going forward, the 16 million.\nBut there are other benefits to it that people who are not on the exchanges are being able to take advantage of. You know, 158 million American women are no longer charged more for health care because of our gender. Young people can stay on their parents' policies until they're 26.\nIf you have a preexisting condition, insurance companies can't shut you out. We have a lot of positives. But there are issues that need to be addressed. I'm going to address them this week, starting with how we're going to try to control the cost of skyrocketing prescription drugs. It's something that I hear about wherever I go. It's part of the plan I will be rolling out in the next few days.\nDICKERSON: Let me ask you about those Planned Parenthood videos. Have you watched them?\nCLINTON: I have seen excerpts from them. And I have certainly read about them.\nAnd what I am troubled by are the misleading, inaccurate allegations about them that we heard from Republicans at their debate. This is really an attack on Planned Parenthood, which provides a lot of health services, from cancer screenings , to contraceptive services, to so many other of the needs women have.\nAnd to shut down the government, which some Republicans are advocating, over funding for Planned Parenthood, which takes care of millions of women's health needs, is just the height of irresponsibility.\nDICKERSON: That's the policy debate this has turned into. But what was your reaction just when you watched them?\nCLINTON: Well, look, as Planned Parenthood has said, these were misleadingly edited. They were intentionally taken out of context.\nThe fact is that, if we want to have a debate in this country about whether we should continue using\u2014or doing fetal research, then it's not only Planned Parenthood that should be involved in that debate. All of the experts, all of the scientists, all of the research institutions, everybody who is looking for cures to Parkinson's, for example, should be asked, should we continue this?\nBut so far as I am aware, what they did, despite the way it was portrayed, is within the laws that were set up for this.\nDICKERSON: This week, the Senate is going to vote to impose a federal ban on late-term abortions. Do you support a federal limit on abortion at any stage of pregnancy?\nCLINTON: This is one of those really painful questions that people raise. And, obviously, it's really emotional.\nI think that the kind of late-term abortions that take place are because of medical necessity. And, therefore, I would hate to see the government interfering with that decision. I think that, again, this gets back to whether you respect a woman's right to choose or not. And I think that is what this whole argument once again is about.\nDICKERSON: In the politics this year, it looks like everybody wants an outsider. [laughter]\nNow, that puts you in a fix....[crosstalk]...Does it put you in a fix? Tell us why it doesn't put you in a fix.\nCLINTON: I cannot imagine anyone being more of an outsider than the first woman president. I mean, really, let's think about that.\nDICKERSON: Now, I agree, but your name\u2014we have not...\nCLINTON: I mean, if you line up\u2014if you\u2014all these mothers and fathers bring me the place mats with all the presidents, and they bring their daughters, and they say, my daughter has a question for you. And the daughter says, how come there are no girls on this place mat?\nDICKERSON: I agree that that is a difference.\nCLINTON: I think that's a pretty big unconventional choice.\nDICKERSON: Yes. But you know what I'm asking.\nCLINTON: Well, I know you're asking, do we want people who have never been elected to anything, who have no political experience, who have never made any hard choices in the public arena? Well, voters are going to have to decide that.\nDICKERSON: But they worry that people who are inside are too inside, that that's why the economic situation is tilted against the middle class. It's why they always feel like everybody can wiggle around the rules.\nAnd that's something you have to deal with, right?\nCLINTON: Of course it is.\nAnd that's why I have an economic policy that is centered on raising incomes, because I think what we inherited from the Bush administration, what President Obama had to deal with had the potential of becoming a great depression, not just a great recession.\nWe have now recovered 13 million jobs, after losing 800,000 a month when he came into office. So, why would we go back to the same policies? Call them insider. Call them tilted toward the rich. Call them giving corporations a free pass to do whatever they want.\nI'm against that. I have always been against that. I want to go back to economic policies where we create millions of new jobs and where people's incomes rise not just at the top, but in the middle and at the bottom, like they did under my husband.\nSo, you know, I'm not running for Bill's third term. I'm not running for President Obama's third term. But it would be really foolish of me not to say, you know, that worked better than what the Republicans offer.\nDICKERSON: What role should Wall Street play in the economy?\nCLINTON: Look, we need financial markets.\nBut they need to be put on notice that any of their behaviors that impact Main Street, that disrupt the kind of orderly processing of financial transactions because high-frequency trading is now going to be making decisions in nanoseconds, or fooling around, as they did in the '80s, in packaging mortgage securities in a way that really bombed us into the great resection, I don't think any financial institution, not just banks, because I think it's important to recognize there are a lot of financial institutions.\nAIG was a problem. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. They were not banks in the traditional sense. We need to rein in the risks posed by these financial institutions.\nDICKERSON: Let me\u2014a final question.\nYour friend the late Diane Blair wrote in her diary\u2014quote\u2014\"On her deathbed, Clinton wants to be able to say she was true to herself and is not going to do phony makeovers to please others.\"\nSo, knowing you don't want to engage in phony makeovers, give us three words that is the real Hillary Clinton. [laughter] Just three.\nCLINTON: Just three? I can't possibly do that.\nI mean, look, I am a real person, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with being that. And I have been in the public eye for so long that I think\u2014you know, it's like the feature that you see in some magazines sometimes. Real people actually go shopping, you know?\nDICKERSON: All right. Well, I'm going to have to really interrupt you.\nThank you, Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Thanks, John.\nDICKERSON: Democratic presidential\u2014Hillary Clinton, we hope to talk to you again soon. Thanks very much.\nAnd we will be back in a moment.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n","11":"\nBLITZER: When they we're not turning on one another, the Republican hopefuls took turns turn\u2014targeting Hillary Clinton in last night's debate.\nIn a CNN exclusive, the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, joins us now live.\nThis is her first live interview from the campaign trail.\nMadam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us.\nCLINTON: Great to talk to you, Wolf.\nI'm in Laconia, New Hampshire.\nBLITZER: It's a lovely place. I'm sure you're going to be spending a lot of the time there, Iowa, among other states.\nIf\u2014you took\u2014you certainly did take a lot of fire from the Republicans at the CNN debate last night. I assume you watched it, especially from the lone female candidate up on the stage, Carly Fiorina.\nShe said if you want to stump a Democrat, she said, ask them about Hillary Clinton's accomplishments as secretary of State.\nIf you were on that debate stage with her, what would you say was your number one accomplishment as secretary of State?\nCLINTON: You know, Wolf, I didn't get to see all of their debate, but I saw enough of it to know that this is just the usual back and forth political attacks, the kinds of things you say when you're on a debate stage and you really don't have much else to say.\nI didn't hear anything from any of them about how they're going to make college more affordable or get down student debt, or get equal pay for equal work for women, what they're going to do to make sure that we deal with the challenges of raising incomes for hardworking people.\nSo I don't really pay a lot of attention to this kind of rhetoric that heats up the debate stage. They're all trying to vie for more attention from, obviously, the Republican Party. I'm going to let them decide how best to do it.\nBut if anybody is interested, you know, there's a long list about what I have done and I'm very proud of it. You can read my book, \"Hard Choices,\" read about how I negotiated a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. You can read about how I put together the coalition that led to international sanctions against Iran. You can read about what I did when I was first lady to get the children's health insurance program, or as senator, working across the aisle on issues like getting better health care for our veterans.\nYou know, this is just the silly season. I am looking forward to eventually debating on that stage whoever they finally nominate once they get around to doing that.\nBLITZER: All right, so listen to what Carly Fiorina also said, Madam Secretary, about some controversial videos opposing Planned Parenthood, an organization you support.\nListen to this.\n[begin video clip]\nCARLY FIORINA, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, to watch these tapes, watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\nThis is about the character of our nation.\n[end video clip]\nBLITZER: All right, Planned Parenthood...\nCLINTON: You know, of course not...\nBLITZER:?\u2014says that video doesn't depict\u2014Madam Secretary, hold on. I just want to explain.\nCLINTON: That's right.\nBLITZER: Planned Parenthood says the video doesn't depict an aborted fetus. They says\u2014they said that was from a miscarriage, it had nothing to do with Planned Parenthood.\nThis is an organization, though, you support.\nFirst of all, have you seen those very, very controversial videos?\nCLINTON: Well, Wolf, let's\u2014let's break down what's happening here, because I think it's important. I know that there's a move on by some of the Republicans in the Congress to actually shut down the United States government over their demand that we no longer give federal funding to Planned Parenthood to perform the really necessary health services that they do for millions of women.\nSo let's put aside for a moment here that there is no debate and there should be absolutely no argument that Planned Parenthood does cancer screenings, it helps provide family planning and contraceptive advice, it works to provide, you know, some of the most difficult kinds of counseling when it comes to giving an HIV test, for example.\nWhat this is about is the fact that some of the Planned Parenthood facilities perform abortions, which is legal under the laws of the United States.\nI understand that the Republican Party and particularly the candidates we heard from last night, wish that were not the case, wish that abortion were illegal and they could turn the clock back.\nSo I think we ought to be very clear that Planned Parenthood has served to provide health care, necessary health care for millions of women. And I think it deserves not only our support, but the continuing funding from the federal government so that these women and girls who are seeking the kinds of services that are provided will be able to achieve that.\nBLITZER: All right, have you\u2014are you confident that Planned Parenthood, Madam Secretary, or any of its affiliated groups, if you will, haven't violated any federal laws?\nCLINTON: Well, Wolf, let me tell you what I know, and that is there is a\u2014a willingness on the part of Planned Parenthood to answer questions. They have been doing so. Some people may not want to hear the answers, but they have certainly put those answers out there into the public arena.\nAnd if the issue\u2014the core issue that some on the stage last night or some in the Congress are trying to promote or trying to raise questions about has to do with the kind of research that is done legally in the United States, then that is an issue that goes far beyond any Planned Parenthood example.\nSo I\u2014I think it's important to sort out\u2014there's a lot of emotion. There's a lot of accusations that are being hurled about. I think it's important to sort out and try to actually figure out what is going on. If it's the services that they are trying to shut down, like providing family planning or breast cancer screenings, that is just wrong and women deserve to be given support to get those services provided.\nIf they want to shut down the legal provision of abortion services, then they've got a bigger problem, because, obviously, they\u2014Planned Parenthood does not use federal dollars to do that.\nAnd if they are more focused on the research that is going on, then that's a set of issues that certainly is not only about Planned Parenthood.\nSo I\u2014I would hope...\nBLITZER: But a...\nCLINTON:?\u2014that the Republicans, and particularly the Republicans in the House, led by Speaker Boehner, would not put our country and our economy in peril pursuing some kind of emotionally politically charged partisan attack on Planned Parenthood to shut our government down.\nBLITZER: All right...\nCLINTON: I think that would be a very, very unfortunate decision.\nBLITZER: All right, let's talk about another source of criticism you received last night, this one from the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie. He said at the debate, you can't tell the American people the truth. Those are his words about your email, whole controversy. He says you should be prosecuted for having a server in your basement. [laughter]\nHe says with national security secrets running through it. He says Russians, Chinese, even 18-year-olds could have hacked into your server.\nYou\u2014you think that was possible, that they hacked into your server?\nCLINTON: There's no evidence of that. And, again, this is\u2014you know, this is overheated rhetoric, baseless charges trying to somehow, you know, gain a footing in the debate and in the primary. And it really doesn't deserve any comment.\nBLITZER: It took you a long time to say you're sorry about what happened, the mistakes you made in organizing that server to begin with.\nWhy did it take so long?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, I was trying to explain, uh, what had happened and obviously it was clear that I should have used two different email accounts and I said that that was a mistake, I'm sorry, I've taken responsibility.\nBut I've also, for more than a year now, been asking to testify before the Congressional committee that is investigating the situation in Benghazi, they would not let me appear.\nFinally\u2014and I'm very happy about this\u2014I will be appearing, toward the end of October, and I will look forward to answer all their questions.\nI'm trying to be as transparent as possible. That's why people are reading the contents of the emails that are being released. It's why I've turned over my server. It's why I will testify.\nBLITZER: You've dismissed Donald Trump's campaign as entertainment, suggested, in part, he's not really serious. But the top Republican candidate right now, Donald Trump, and, for that matter, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, they're all political outsiders and your main Democratic opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, he's pulling ahead in some of these polls in New Hampshire and Iowa. He's running as an outsider, as well.\nSo how do you deal with that?\nWhy is Bernie Sanders, for example, ahead of you in these polls in New Hampshire and Iowa right now?\nCLINTON: Well, I\u2014I've said for a long time, polls are going to go up, they're going to go down. I'm very confident and very comfortable about our strategy. I feel that our campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire, all the early states, and now we're moving on to the states that come after, are really coming together well.\nI'm excited by the level and intensity of the support that I have. So I always thought this would be a competitive election. I'm looking forward to it. This is an important job. This is the most important job not only in our country, but in the world. And people have to fight hard. They have to make their case and they have to earn the votes of the American voters.\nBLITZER: You sat next to Joe Biden when you were the secretary of State for four years. He's been the vice president of the United States now for almost seven years, a heartbeat away from the presidency.\nIf he does decide to run, will you be able to tell the American people that you're more qualified to be president than he is?\nCLINTON: Well, Wolf, I'm not going to comment on a hypothetical and I'm certainly not going to comment on my good friend and former colleague. He has to make up his own mind about what's best for him and his family, as he wrestles with his choice.\nBut I will tell the American people I believe that my set of experiences, my plans for the future, my vision for what America should be, what I've already told voters I would do on everything from making college affordable to paying down student debt to tackling climate change by making us the clean energy superpower, dealing with substance abuse and addiction, like I did here in New Hampshire today.\nI have a very comprehensive agenda that I think address the very issues that Americans are talking to me about. And I know that having been around the presidency, both as the first lady in the '90s and then as a member of President Obama's cabinet, working with other presidents, as a senator and even in private life, I feel very confident that I'm the right person at the right time to lead our country to deal with the growing issues around incomes that are not raising enough money for people to feel they've got a better future, about the kind of jobs we need more of, about how more workers get to share in the productivity by sharing the profits of what they helped produce.\nI'm the one out there talking very specifically about what I would do because I want to run a campaign that lays out my agenda, because when I get elected, I'm going to start working on it immediately.\nBLITZER: I know\u2014I know your time is limited. A quick question, are you ready to tell Democrats, indeed, the American public today, that you're ready to accept more Democratic presidential debates than already scheduled?\nYou're under pressure to do so.\nCLINTON: Well, Wolf, I have said from the very beginning, I look forward to debating. I look forward to the debate, you know, next month, you know, now just a month away. And I will certainly show up anywhere the Democratic National Committee tells us to show up, because I want us to have a good exchange of ideas and to make sure that Democratic voters first, and then general voters to follow, see exactly what we each stand for and what our positions are.\nSo, you know, I\u2014I am ready and willing, no matter what they decide to show up and be there.\nBLITZER: Are you ready to ask the DNC to authorize more Democratic presidential debates?\nCLINTON: That's up to them. They can, you know, they made their decision. But I have made it clear that if they want to do more, I'm happy to do them.\nBLITZER: Clearly, you're influential, though, with the DNC. And if you want more debates, I'm sure that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC, would\u2014would go ahead.\nLet me ask you one final question before I let you go.\nYou've praised your husband as a great president.\nSo let me ask you this.\nWould you be a better president than Bill Clinton was as president of the United States? [laughter]\nCLINTON: Oh, Wolf, you know, that\u2014that's one of those questions that I cannot and will not answer. I will say this. I think if you look at the last 35 years, actually, if you go back further, I think it's pretty indisputable that having a Democrat in the White House is good for our economy, better for our economy than the alternative.\nI think my husband understood that and produced. I think President Obama inherited a\u2014a really big and dangerous mess and has, you know, been able to get us out of that ditch.\nSo I'm not running for my husband's third term. I'm certainly not running for President Obama's third term. I'm running for my first term.\nBut I do believe that both of them understood what it would take to try to clean up the messes they inherited from their Republican predecessors and begin to get the economy and the country working again for everybody.\nAnd that's exactly the kind of president I will be, as well.\nBLITZER: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for joining us.\nGood luck out there on the campaign trail.\nWe'll look forward to covering you. We'll look forward to covering, obviously, all of those Democratic presidential debates, as well.\nThanks very much for joining us.\nCLINTON: Thank you so much, Wolf.\nGood to talk to you.\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n","12":"\nCLINTON: Thank you so much, Strobe. Thank you so much. [applause]\nWell let me thank you, Strobe. It's great to be back at Brookings and there are a lot of long-time friends and colleagues who perch here at Brookings. Obviously, including Strobe and Martin, who I'll speak to in a minute. Also Bob Einhorn and Tammy Wittes.\nThis institution has hosted many important conversation over the years and I appreciate Strobe's reference to the event last night and the continuing dialogue about urgent issues facing our nation and the world. That's what brings me here today, back to Brookings, to talk about the question we're all grappling with: how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and more broadly, how to protect ourselves and our allies from the full range of threats that Iran poses.\nThe stakes are high and there are no simple of perfectly satisfying solutions. So these questions, and in particular the merits of the nuclear deal recently reached with Iran, have divided people of good will and raised hard issues on both sides.\nHere is how I see it. Either we move forward on the path of diplomacy and seize this chance to block Iran's path to a nuclear weapon or, we turn down a more dangerous path, leading to a far-less certain and riskier future. That's why I support this deal. I support it as part of a larger strategy toward Iran.\nBy now, the outcome in Congress is no longer in much doubt. So we've got to start looking made to what comes next, enforcing the deal, deterring Iran and its proxies and strengthening our allies. These will be my goals as president and today I want to talk about how I would achieve them.\nLet me start by saying I understand the skepticism so many feel about Iran. I too am deeply concerned about Iranian aggression and the need to confront it. It's a ruthless, brutal regime that has the blood of Americans, many others and including its own people on its hands.\nIts political rallies resound with cries of, \"Death to America.\" Its leaders talk about wiping Israel off the face of the map, most recently just yesterday, and foment terror against it. There is absolutely no reason to trust Iran.\nNow, Vice President Cheney may hope that the American people will simply forget, but the truth is, by the time President Obama took office and I became secretary of State, Iran was racing toward a nuclear capability.\nThey had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, meaning that they had the material, scientists and technical know how to create material for nuclear weapons. They had produced and installed thousands of centrifuges, expanded their secret facilities, established a robust uranium enrichment program and defied their international obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. And they haven't suffered many consequences.\nI voted for sanctions again and again as a senator from New York. But they weren't having much effect. Most of the world still did business with Iran. We needed to step up our game.\nSo President Obama and I pursued a two-prong strategy: pressure and engagement. We made it clear that the door to diplomacy was open if Iran answered the concerns of the international community in a serious and credible way.\nWe simultaneously launched a comprehensive campaign to significantly raise the cost of Iranian defiance. We systematically increased our military capabilities in the region, deepening our cooperation with partners and sending more fire power, an additional aircraft carrier, battleship, strike aircraft and the most advanced radar and missile defense systems available.\nMeanwhile, I traveled the world capital by capital, leader by leader, twisting arms to help build the global coalition that produced some of the most effective sanctions in history.\nWith President Obama's leadership, we worked with Congress and the European Union to cut Iran off from the world's economic and financial system. And one by one, we persuaded energy-hungry consumers of Iranian oil, like India and South Korea, to cut back.\nSoon, Iran's tankers sat rusting in port. Its economy was collapsing.\nThese new measures were effective because we made them global. American sanctions provided the foundation, but Iran didn't really feel the heat until we turned this into an international campaign so biting that Iran had no choice but to negotiate. They could no longer play off one country against another; they had no place to hide.\nSo they started looking for a way out. I first visited Oman to speak with the sultan of Oman in January of 2011, went back later that year. The sultan helped set up a secret back channel. I sent one of my closest aids as part of a small team to begin talks with the Iranians in secret.\nNegotiations began in earnest after the Iranian election in 2013. First, the bilateral talks led by Deputy Secretary Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan that led to the interim agreement, then the multilateral talks led by Secretary John Kerry, Secretary Ernie Moniz and Undersecretary Wendy Sherman.\nNow there's a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program. Is it perfect? Well, of course not. No agreement like this ever is.\nBut is a strong agreement? Yes, it is. And we absolutely should not turn it down.\nThe merits of the deal have been well-argued, so I won't go through them in great detail here. The bottom line is that it accomplishes the major goals we set out to achieve. It blocks every pathway for Iran to get a bomb, and it gives us better tools for verification and inspection and to compel rigorous compliance.\u00a0 Without a deal, Iran's breakout time, how long they need to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon, would shrink to a couple of months. With a deal, that breakout time stretches to a year, which means that if Iran cheats, we'll know it, and we'll have time to respond decisively.\nWithout a deal, we would have no credible inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. With a deal, we'll have unprecedented access; we'll be able to monitor every aspect of their nuclear program.\nNow, some have expressed concern that certain nuclear restrictions expire after 15 years. And we need to be vigilant about that, which I'll talk more about in a moment. But other parts are permanent, including Iran's obligations under the Non-proliferation Treaty and their commitment to enhanced inspections under the additional protocol.\nOthers have expressed concern that it could take up to 24 days to gain access to some of Iran's facilities when we suspect cheating. I'd be the first to say that this part of the deal is not perfect. Although the deal does allow for daily access to enrichment facilities and monitoring of the entire nuclear fuel cycle.\nIt's important to focus on that, because being able to monitor the supply chain is critical to what we will find out and how we will be able to respond. But our experts tell us that even with delayed access to some places, this deal does the job. Microscopic nuclear particles remain for years and years. They are impossible to hide. That's why Secretary Moniz, a nuclear physicist, has confidence in this plan.\nAnd some are suggested we just go back to the negotiating table and get a better, unspecified deal. I can certainly understand why that may sound appealing, but as someone who started these talks in the first place, and built our global coalition piece by piece, I can assure you it is not realistic. Plus, if we walk away now, our capacity to sustain and enforce sanctions will be severely diminished.\nWe will be blamed, not the Iranians.\nSo if we were to reject this agreement, Iran would be poised to get nearly everything it wants without giving up a thing. No restrictions on their nuclear program. No real warning if Tehran suddenly rushes toward a bomb. And the International Sanctions regime would fall apart, so no more economic consequences for Iran, either. Those of use who have been out there on the diplomatic front lines know that diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection; it's the balancing of risk.\nAnd on balance, the far riskier course right now would be to walk away. Great powers can't just junk agreements and expect the rest of the world to go along with us. We need to be reasonable and consistent, and keep our word, especially when we are trying to lead a coalition.\nThat is how we will make this and future deals work. But it is not enough to say, \"yes,\" to the deal. Of course it isn't.We have to say, yes, and\u2014yes, and we will enforce it with vigor and vigilance. Yes, and we will embed it in a broader strategy to confront Iran's bad behavior in the region. Yes, and we will begin from day one to set the conditions, so Iran knows it will never get a nuclear weapon, not during the term of the agreement, not after, not ever. We need to be clear. And I think we have to make that very clear to Iran about what we expect from them. This is not the start of some larger diplomatic opening and we shouldn't accept that this deal will lead to broader changes in their behavior.\nThat shouldn't be a promise for proceeding, instead we need to be prepared for three scenarios. First, Iran tries to cheat, something it's been quite willing to do in the past. Second, Iran tries to wait us out, perhaps it waits to move for 15 years when some, but not all restrictions expire. And third, Iran ramps up the dangerous behavior in the region, including its support for terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.\nI believe the success of this deal has a lot to do with how the next president grapples with these challenges. So let me tell you what I would do. My starting point will be one of distrust.\nYou remember President Reagan's line about the Soviets: Trust but verify? My approach will be distrust and verify. We should anticipate that Iran will test the next president, they'll want to see how far they can bend the rules. That won't work if I'm in the white house.\nI will hold the line against Iranian noncompliance, that means penalties even for small violations, keeping our allies on board, but being willing to snapback sanctions into place unilaterally if we have to, working with congress to close any gaps in the sanctions. Right now members of congress are offering proposals to that affect and I think the current administration should work with them to see whether there are additional steps that could be taken.\nFinally it means insuring that the IAEA has the resources it needs from finances to personnel to equipment to hold Iran's feet to the fire. The most important thing we can do to keep Iran from cheating or trying to wait us out is to shaped Iranian expectations right from the start. The Iranians and the world need to understand that we will act decisively if we need to.\nSo here is my message to Iran's leaders, The United States will never allow you to acquire a nuclear weapon. As president, I will take whatever action is necessary to protect the united states and our allies, I will not hesitate to take military action if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon, and I will set up my successor to be able to credibly make the same pledge. We will make clear to Iran that our commitment to prevention will not waver depending on who is in office, it's permanent.\nShould it become necessary in the future having exhausted peaceful alternatives to turn to military force, we will have preserved and in some cases enhanced our capacity to act. And because we have proven our commitment to diplomacy first, the world will more likely join us.\nThen there is the broader issue of countering Iran's bad behavior across the region. Taking nuclear-weapons out of the equation is crucial because an Iran with nuclear weapons is so much more dangerous, than an Iran without them.\nBut even without nuclear weapons, we still see Iran's fingerprints on nearly every conflict across the Middle East. They support bad actors from Syria, to Lebanon, to Yemen. They vow to destroy Israel. And that's worth saying again. They vow to destroy Israel. We can not ever take that lightly, particularly when Iran ships and advanced missiles to Hezbollah and the ayatollah outlines an actual strategy for eliminating Israel, or talks about how Israel won't exist in 25 years just like he did today.\nAnd in addition to the malicious activity they already underwrite, we have got to anticipate that Iran could use some of the economic relief they get from this deal to pay for even more. So as President I will raise the costs for their actions and confront them across the board. My strategy will be based on five strong pillars.\nFirst, I will deepen America's unshakeable commitment to Israel's security, including our long standing tradition of guaranteeing Israel's qualitative military edge. I'll increase support for Israeli rocket and missile defenses and for intelligence sharing. I'll sell Israel the most sophisticated fire aircraft ever developed. The F-35. We'll work together to develop and implement better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling and kidnapping as well as the strongest possible missile defense system for Northern Israel, which has been subjected to Hezbollah's attacks for years.\nSecond, I will reaffirm that the Persian Gulf is a region of vital interest to the United States. We do not want any of Iran's neighbors to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon's program either. So we want them to feel and be secure. I will sustain a robust military presence in the region, especially our air and naval forces. We'll keep the Strait of Hormuz open. We'll increase security cooperation with our Gulf allies, including intelligence sharing, military support and missile defense to ensure they can defend against Iranian aggression. Even if that takes the form of cyberattacks or other non-traditional threats.\nIran should understand that the United States and I as President, will not stand by as our Gulf allies and partners are threatened. We will act. Third, I will be a coalition to counter Iran's proxies, particularly Hezbollah. That means enforcing and strengthening the rules prohibiting the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah. Looking at new ways to choke off their funding and pressing our partners to treat Hezbollah as the terrorist organization that it is.\nIt's time to eliminate the false distinction that some still make between the supposed political and military wings. If you're part of Hezbollah, you're part of a terrorist organization, plain and simple. Beyond Hezbollah, I'll crack down on the shipment of weapons to Hamas. And push Turkey and Qatar to end their financial support. I'll press our partners in the region to prevent aircrafts and ships owned by companies linked to Iran's revolutionary guard from entering their territories, and urge our partners to block Iranian plans from entering their airspace on their way to Yemen and Syria.\nAcross the board, I will vigorously enforce and strengthen, if necessary, other American sanctions on Iran and its revolutionary guard for its sponsorship of terrorism, its ballistic missile program and other destabilizing activities.\u00a0 I'll enforce and strengthen, if necessary, our restrictions on sending arms to Iran and from Iran to bad actors like Syria, and I'll impose these sanctions on everyone involved in these activities, whether they're in Iran or overseas. This will be a special imperative, as some of the U.N. sanctions lapse, so the U.S. and our partners have to step up.\nFourth, I'll stand, as I always have, against Iran's abuses at home, from its detention of political prisoners, to its crack down on freedom of expression, including online. Its inhumane policies hold back talented and spirited people. Our quarrel is not and never has been that the Iranian people. They'd have a bright future, hopeful future if they weren't held back by their leaders.\nAs I've said before, I think we were too restrained in our support of the protests in June 2009 and in our condemnation of the government crack down that followed. That won't happen again. We will enforce, and if need be, broaden our human rights sanction and I will not rest until every single American detained or missing in Iran is home.\nFifth, just to the nuclear agreement needs to be embedded in a broader Iran policy. Our broader Iran policy needs to be embedded in a comprehensive regional strategy that promotes stability and counters extremism.\nIran, like ISIS, benefits from chaos and strife. It exploits other countries' weaknesses and the best defense against Iran are the countries and governments being strong, that they can provide security and economic opportunity to their own people and they must have the tools to push back on radicalization and extremism.\nHelping countries get there will take time and strategic discipline, but it's crucial that the United States leads this effort. I will push for renewed diplomacy to solve the destructive regional conflicts that Iran fuels. We have to bring sufficient pressure on Assad to force a political solution in Syria, including a meaningful increase in our efforts to train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition, something I called for early in the conflict, and the United States must lead in assisting those who have been uprooted by conflict, especially the millions of Syrian refugees now beseeching the world to help them.\nAs Pope Francis reminded us, this is an international problem that demands an international response, and the United States must help lead that response. That's who we are, and that's what we do.\nSo our strategy needs to cover all these bases, Iran's nuclear ambitions and its support of terrorism, its hatred of Israel and its cruelty towards its citizens, its military resources and its economic strengths and weaknesses. We need to be creative, committed and vigilant, and on every front, we need to keep working closely with our friends and partners.\nOn that note, let me just spend a minute speaking about the serious concerns that Israel's leaders have about this deal. Israel has every reason to be alarmed by a regime that both denies its existence and seeks its destruction.\u00a0 I would not support this agreement for one second if I thought it put Israel in greater danger. I believe in my core that Israel and America must stand side by side, and I\u2014I will always stand by Israel's right to defend itself, as I always have.\u00a0 I believe this deal and a joint strategy for enforcing it makes Israel safer.\nI say that with humility. I'm not Israeli. I don't know what it's like to live under constant threat from your neighbors in a country where the margin for error is so thin. I know that my saying this deal makes you safer won't alleviate the very real fears of the Israeli people.\nBut I have stood for Israeli security for a very long time. It was one of my bedrock principles as secretary of state. It's why I supported stronger defense systems, like the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system, which proved so effective in protecting Israeli lives during the conflicts of 2012 and last summer, that's why I've worked closely with Israel to advance the two-state vision of a Jewish and Democratic Israel with secure and recognized borders, and it's why I believe we should expedite negotiations of a long-term military assistance agreement with Israel.\nLet's not wait until 2017 when the current deal expires; let's get it done this year.\nI would invite the Israeli prime minister to the White House during my first month in office to talk about all of these issues and to set us on a course of close, frequent consultation right from the start, because we both rely on each other for support as partners, allies and friends.\nThis isn't just about policy for me; it is personal. As president, I'm committed to shoring up and strengthening the relationship between our countries.\nWe have had honest disagreements about this deal. Now is the time to come together. Now is the time to remember what unites us and build upon it.\nAnd so I know well that the same forces that threaten Israel threaten the United States. And to the people of Israel, let me say, you'll never have to question whether we're with you. The United States will always be with you. There have also been honest disagreements about the nuclear deal here at home. Smart, serious people can see issues like these differently, like my friend, Chuck Schumer, who's going to be an excellent leader in the Senate. I respect the skepticism that he and others feel, and I respect differences of opinion and people who advocate vigorously for their beliefs.\nBut I have a harder time respecting those who approach an issue as serious as this with unserious talk, especially anyone running to be president of the United States.\nSeveral Republican candidates boast they'll tear up this agreement in 2017, more than a year after it's been implemented. That's not leadership; that's recklessness. It would set us right down the very dangerous path we have worked so hard to avoid.\nI'm looking forward to a\u2014a robust debate about foreign policy in this campaign. Where we have disagreements, we should lay them out, like if American ground forces in Iraq should engage in direct combat, as Scott Walker wants, or if we should keep Cuba closed, as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush want. Let's debate these issues.\u00a0 But let's debate them on the basis of facts, not fear. Let's resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those who disagree with us, and let's avoid at all costs undermining America's credibility abroad. That only makes us weaker, and I am going to call it out whenever I see it.\nI spent four years representing America abroad as America\u2014secretary of state was one of the greatest privileges of my life, and knowing my fellow Americans were counting on the and rooting for me, not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans, meant to great deal.\nWe are all one team, the American team and that doesn't change, no matter how much we may disagree. I can tell you from personal experience we are stronger overseas, when we are united at home. So we simply have to find a way to work together better than we have been doing. There is a lot Democrats and Republicans can and should agree on.\nThe United States should lead in the Middle East, we can agree on that. We should stand by our friends against Iranian aggression, we can agree on that, too. I believe the plan I have laid out today is one that all Americans could endorse, and I hope they will.\nThe next president will face threats from many quarters, from those we see today like terrorism from ISIS, aggressiveness from Putin, pandemics like Ebola, to all those we can't predict yet.\nWe need a leader who has a strong vision for the future, and the skill and determination to get us there. We can't stop the world from changing, but we can help to shape those changes, and we can do that by beating with strength, smarts and unyielding commitment to our values. You know, I saw that when I was first lady, senator, secretary of state, that when America leads with principal and purpose, other people and governments are eager to join us.\nNo country comes close to matching our advantages, the strength of our economy, the skill of our work force, tradition of innovation, our unmatched network of alliances and partnership. So, we are poised to remain that world's most admired and powerful nation for of long time, if we make this smart choices and practice smart leadership. That is what I will try to do as your president, and I believe as strongly as ever that our best days are ahead of us, and that America's greatest contributions to the world are yet to come.\nThank you all very much. [applause]\nINDYK: Well, thank you, very much, Madam Secretary.\nI was wondering what we could call this speech, and it occurred to me at the end it would be, \"From Hard Choices to Smart Choices.\" Right? Or the \"Yes, And\" speech.\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to this second part of the event with Secretary Clinton, which is little a conversation that I will have with her, and then we'll take questions from the audience.\nI wanted to start by saying, number one, it's a very clear and very strong speech. And if I had to summarize the basic elements of it, the message to Iran is, we will enforce, we will confront you when you try to destabilize the region, and we will deter you if you try to go for a nuclear weapon some time down the line.\u00a0 And I wonder how you navigate what is a certain, unspoken tension between the fact that you're going to be taking a hard line against some of the\u2014some of the destabilizing and nefarious activities of the Iranians, and at the same time, this agreement puts the United States into a partnership with Iran in terms of implementing it.\nSo how do you deal with that\u2014that tension, the Iranians may feel, \"Hey, we're giving up all these things to do with our nuclear program and this is what we're going to get in return,\" is\u2014is very tough American response?\nCLINTON: Well, I don't see Iran as our partner in implementing the agreement. I believe that Iran is the subject of the agreement, that it now faces obligations that frankly, in many instances, it faced before the agreement and that they have a\u2014signed an agreement where they are committing themselves to fulfill the terms of the agreement.\nThe agreement will be enforced not by Iran, the agreement will be enforced by the rest of the negotiators, the other countries plus the IAEA, and it will be and is intended to be quite burdensome and intrusive into Iran.\nNow, maybe they believe that having signed the agreement, they can somehow avoid the consequences of the inspections and the other requirements, but I think they understand very well they're at the starting line, there are these demands that they are supposed to fulfill, there is a sequencing of you know, lifting of sanctions and other kinds of benefits that they receive in return for they're having taken the action required.\nAnd I think they are, if anything, probably counting on the world led by the United States being distracted, being diverted, getting tired, not having the staying power to consistently enforce the agreement and hold Iran accountable, and I for one, want to make clear to them that that is not going to happen, that we will take seriously every aspect of this agreement and we will expect them to comply and there will be consequences if they do not.\nINDYK: When you called for a\u2014a regional strategy and outlined the\u2014the elements of that, it really seems to come down to when you say this in the speech, Syria and what happens in Syria where Iran is very invested in the Assad regime. Does a regional strategy on your watch mean taking down the Assad regime?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, Martin, it's not only Iran that is invested, we're\u2014obviously it's now becoming public, we are learning much more about Russian investment, Russian troops on the ground. It may very well be opening the door to greater Russian involvement. There is no doubt that Russian has\u2014Russia has been a principal funder and supplier throughout this entire terrible episode.\nSo we are facing the collapse of Syria, the survival thus far of the Assad regime, although it clearly has much less to govern than it did when this started, the open ungoverned areas that are hosting terrorist groups and the continuing commitment from Iran and Russia to propping up Assad.\nSo I\u2014you know, I was the principal negotiator on the Geneva 2012 agreement, which Russia signed onto, which laid out a pathway to a political solution. It wasn't very long until Russia reneged on what they had signed. But I think it still provides a very credible framework threat from the terrorist groups and that the chaos in Syria can destabilize the region in ways that are bad for Iran. And therefore the higher the pressure is for some kind of reaction to what is going on inside Syria, and certainly the efforts that ISIS is making to take even more and hold territory in Iraq directly against what Iran sees as its interest, the continuing destabilization along the Lebanese border, there's all kinds of reasons why Iran is going to have to confront this instability.\nSo I think we\u2014my view on this is we have to be talking, and pushing on, and raising the cost for Iran and for Russia all the time. Now, if Putin were sitting here\u2014which is hard to imagine, but if he were\u2014I should ask Strobe\u2014Strobe is the expert. He would say, \"We're fighting terrorism, that's what we are doing. There may be a way to begin to join those efforts.\"\nINDYK: So\u2014the\u2014I remember well a speech that you gave when you were secretary of state, in which you warned the Gulf leaders about policies that were based on sand. President Obama in talking about the concerns of Iran's destabilizing activity in the region said, \"Look, we can help protect our Gulf Arab allies from external threats. the problem is how to protect them from internal threats.\" And you have been clear again that you will do that in terms of protecting against those threats, but I wanted\u2014I wonder how you deal with that continuing challenge?\nCLINTON: Well, you know very well it is a difficult one. I apologize for my voice I'm suffering under massive allergy assault. Yes, Republican histamines are everywhere. [laughter]\nSo\u2014you know, Martin, this is one of the biggest problems we face, nobody can deny that much of the extremism in the world today is the direct result of policies and funding undertaken by the Saudi government and individuals. We would be foolish not to recognize that, I think increasingly they would be mistaken not to recognize that.\nYou can never be more extreme than the next extremist and I think they face some very serious internal problems, as do the other regimes. I am not sure they are convinced of that. I am not sure they believe that they have to figure out different ways of dealing with their own population and cooperating with each other, and cutting off funding, and exporting troublesome imams to elsewhere. But I think you have to be constantly beating that drum with them, and maybe now, given the rise of ISIS and the very clear threat they feel from, you know, Iranian activities in the Gulf that maybe there's an openness there. I know that the king was here last week, had a chance to, you know, meet with the president.\nSo perhaps there's more of an opportunity for a candid dialogue than we've had in the past. However, having said that, I still think we have to do what we need to do to defend them because the alternatives are hardly more promising.\nINDYK: Israel. You\u2014you've made a very clear effort in your speech to say that, \"It's time for healing, it's time to come together.\" And when you're President that you would have the Prime Minister there in your first month. And that's very consistent I think as you said in your speech with your approach which has always been as I know, to put your arm around Prime Minister Netanyahu or rather...\nCLINTON: Or any Prime Minister.\nINDYK: Thank you from the Gurney Press. [laughter]\nAnd\u2014and, as you know that's a policy I support too. But some of my friends in Israel recently have said, \"That's not the way to deal with us, we need tough love.\" Which is the alternative you know? Instead of rewarding bad behavior which you should be really speaking tough\u2014more toughly to us. Well, how do you respond to that?\nCLINTON: Well I think there's a lot of room for tough love, particularly in private and behind you know, closed doors. As I write in my book, you know, certainly Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have had very rigorous conversations that have gone on in person and over the phone.\nBut I\u2014I just don't think it's a particularly productive approach for the United States to take because in large measure, it opens the door to everybody else to delegitimize Israel to, you know, pile on in ways that are not good for the\u2014the strength and stability, not just of Israel obviously but of the region. And so, in the absence of you know, some kind of greater goal that we were trying to achieve by doing that I just don't think that is the smartest approach.\nINDYK: All right. Let's go to your questions. I would ask you please to identify yourself and make sure that there's a question mark at the\u2014at the end of your question.\nRobin Wright ?\nCLINTON: Hi, Robin.\nQUESTION: Thank you. Robin Wright , U.S. Institute of Peace and former Brookings scholar.\nMadam Secretary, you talked about how you would use American muscle to contain Iran. Can you tell us how you might use the new diplomatic channel to engage Iran on issues whether it's support for extremist groups or specifically dealing with the crisis in Syria. Would you be willing to use that diplomatic channel to engage Iran?\nCLINTON: Yes, I would, Robin. And I\u2014and I would because I think that we have to attempt to do that, you know?\u00a0 When I first went to Oman in January of 2011, we didn't know whether any effort at some kind of secret channel would pay off. We still had the P5-plus-1 that was going on and we knew that eventually whatever the United States did would have to merge into the international approach.\nBut we had to begin to explore it. And we did. And we explored it over that summer. That's when we had the first, you know, visit to discuss anything could be possible. It takes awhile, as you know so well, being such an expert in this region, to figure out who's at the table, what the conversation's about, how seriously it will be taken, who's backing you up. And so, then when the\u2014the talks actually started, just in the Iranian-American channel with Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan and Bob Einhorn was also involved.\nIt was\u2014it was exploratory and it laid down some of the\u2014the ground rules that we were looking for, and then eventually it was merged into the larger P5-plus-1 once there was a change in government in Iran and there was some real seriousness of effort.\nSo with respect to the other issues, I\u2014I\u2014I have very clearly, in the public arena, seen the Iranians at the highest levels reject any such discussion. They don't want to talk about Yemen, they don't want to talk about anything other than the nuclear agreement. Now that was a strategic decision we made back then.\nYou know, number one, it appeared to us in the early discussions with them, trying to figure out how to proceed. They wanted to talk about everything as a way to get some items on the table to trade off for the nuclear agreement, so that they would not have to make, perhaps, as many concessions as we were expecting them to make. That's why we kept very focused on just the nuclear program.\nWe also had the continuing challenge, and it would be even in this instance, of our friends in the Gulf not wanting us to talk about anything that affected them in a bilateral channel with the Iranians, and you can understand why. I mean, they\u2014you know, if they weren't going to be at the table, they didn't want the United States talking about Yemen or talking about anything else of interest, of vital interest in their views to them.\nSo if there were a way to construct such a\u2014a channel, I would be open to it, but I'm just laying out some of the difficulties of us being able to do that on this suite of other issues that are complex that touch many of the\u2014the region's vital interests. And\u2014and I think when it comes to Syria, we have historically not wanted to talk to Iran about Syria because we knew Iran was basically the principal supporter, propper up if you will, of Assad and we wanted to get the rest of the international community in harness to have a set of expectations and demands before we brought Iran in.\nSo we have to\u2014you know, we have to readjust this all the time. Just as I said, diplomacy is the balancing of risk, it's also the\u2014the constant evaluation of where the opportunities are, where the openings are, what possibly could happen now that didn't happen before. So I'm open but I am very sober about how it would have to be constructed and what it would actually cover and who would have to be either at the table or you know, in the\u2014in the first chair behind, so that they didn't feel that they were being left out or negotiated over.\nQUESTION: [inaudible]\nCLINTON: Here comes your microphone.\nQUESTION: Thanks for the microphone.\nQUESTION: [off-mike]\nCLINTON: So I think that's a very\u2014it's an important questions. I don't know if you could hear the question. But it was\u2014it was aimed at, what could you do to up the cost on Russia, for example, to be a more productive partner in seeking a solution? And how would we do more to\u2014as I understood what you said, you know, work with our European partners on these securities issues that are challenging Europe? And we see that everyday with the refugees because it's humanitarian but it's also a security challenge as well?\nWell, you know, I\u2014I have been\u2014I remain convinced that we need a concerted effort to really up the costs on Russia, and in particular on Putin. I think we have not done enough. I am in the category of people who wanted us to do more in response to the annexation of Crimea and the continuing destabilization of Ukraine. I understand the hesitation, not only in our country but most importantly, in Europe.\nThe sanctions came out of the all discussions and you know, maybe to some extent they have had you know, some impact. I think the falling oil price has had more impact and we've got to figure out how we you know, combine both in looking at ways to put more\u2014to up the costs, to put more pressure on Putin. I think it's one of the long term security challenges that United States, Europe, and especially NATO face. And I don't think we can dance around it very much longer.\nI mean, we all wish it wasn't the case. We all wish it would go away. We all wish that Putin would choose to modernize his country and move toward the west, instead of you know, sinking himself deeper into you know, historical roots of czar-like behavior and intimidation along borders, and projecting Russian power in places like Syria and elsewhere.\nBut I think the jury is in, I think that he intends to continue to do what he is doing and go as far as he can get away with. And I believe that we've got to regroup\u2014we've got to regroup quickly, because I worry very much about what's happening in Syria right now.\nTroops on the ground to allegedly protect military supplies. What is Russia's real objective? You know, the stated objective, the public objective, to fight terrorism, has always been their rationale. Why did they support Assad? Because after Assad there would be terrorism. Now, obviously if we had a different approach from the beginning working together we might've avoided this. We might've actually help to midwife a political transition. So I think we've got to spend a lot more time.\nAll the\u2014you know, all the Russian experts that you know, that thought that their work was done after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I hope that they will be dusting off their materials and I'm looking right at Strobe Talbott, and you know, get back in the game with us. Because, I think Russia's objectives are to stymie and to confront and to undermine American power whenever and wherever they can. I don't think there's much\u2014you know, I don't think there's much to be surprised about that.So where we can work with them? You know, that's one of the\u2014you know, one of the criticisms that sometimes comes from the right, the Republicans. You know, \"What did the reset ever accomplish?\" Well, Medvedev was president actually quite a lot. We did the New START agreement. We got cooperation on Iran because when we got the Security Council to pass the sanctions that we had been working so hard on, that was under Medvedev in June of 2010. We got support to ship lethal material and equipment across to Russia to resupply our troops. We got a lot.\nNow, that all changed once you know, Putin announced he was going to be president again now. There's\u2014I don't admire very much about Mr. Putin, but the idea you can stand and say, \"I will be your next president.\" That does have a certain, you know, attraction to it. [laughter]\nSo, you know, I think we've got\u2014we've really\u2014we are not spending the\u2014the time. We're not thinking, we're not digging deep into what are we going to do. So, to answer the question of the\u2014of the woman who asked, we have to do more to get back talking about how we try to confine, contain, deter Russian aggression in Europe and beyond. And try to figure out what are the best tools for doing that and don't lose sight of the architect because we're going to have a lot of issues up there well.\nSo, I\u2014I\u2014I was always of that opinion. Expressed it vocally within the administration. And nothing that has happened since has in anyway persuaded me other wise.\nQUESTION: And I'll just do a quick follow up on that which is more generally, you know. You\u2014you've got to take on the Russians and Putin. You've got to deal with a very comprehensive strategy for a very complicated part of the world called the Middle East. How do you do the rebalancing to Asia on top of all of this?\nCLINTON: Well, I\u2014I do think we're capable of doing more than one thing although sometimes it appears difficult. And\u2014and I think we've got to be much more global in our thinking and globally present. The rebalancing to Asia, otherwise known as the pivot, was in response to the very real sense of abandonment that Asian leaders expressed to me. My phone calls to them before I ever went to the region in February of 2009, you know, they\u2014they believed that because we were focused in Afghanistan and we were so focused in Iraq, and obviously had to be given all that we had invested there, that we were just not paying attention to the developments in Asia. I think we've come along in some ways in trying to rebalance but we have a long to go.\nAnd there's much at stake in how we deal with all the players in Asia. I'm hoping that the upcoming trip I have with President Xi Jinping produces some positive outcomes. I thought the climate agreement was quite consequential having been in Copenhagen in '09 with the President when we literally had to break into a meeting where the Chinese were consolidating India, South Africa and Brazil against any kind of movement toward the non advanced economies taking responsibility. So I think we've got some good stakes in the ground but we don't have a\u2014a strategy yet that is going to be consistent.\nAnd the final thing I'll say about this, Martin, and I alluded to it in my remarks, I think one of our\u2014one of our real problems right now is we don't have a consistent foreign policy that is bipartisan, let alone non-partisan. And I think that's a problem.\nI mean, I was appalled when those Republican senators wrote to the ayatollah. I thought it was incredibly, you know, short-sighted and you know, wrong-headed. And I don't think\u2014I don't know what we rebuild a consistent foreign policy from administration to administration, regardless of Republican or Democrat. You know, it was a lot easier in a bipolar world, us versus the Soviet Union, I understand that, but I think we really have to work at it. And we can't work at it if we don't have a set of strategic pillars and organizing principles that we can present to our own people and present to the Congress and present to the world.\nSo I think we have work to do.\nINDYK: Andrea?\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, when you talk about the policies with Syria and Putin, was it, in retrospect, a mistake for the administration after you left office to pull back on Labor Day, a couple of years ago, make the deal with Russia on the chemical weapons? Yes, the weapons were disposed of, but that created a different partnership, if you will, on diplomacy.\nAnd secondly, with reference to our colleague from Germany, what should America do to step up to the crisis of migration? Even if it's not on our front door, it is a moral issue, is it not, for the world? Thank you.\nCLINTON: As to the first one, you know, it's always difficult in hindsight to say what could have happened if something different had been done. IF we remember back to that time, prime minister Cameron had lost the vote in the parliament. He wanted to show support for the president's policy of taking some limited military action in light of Syria's use of chemical weapons.\nSo it became clear that there was going to be a difficult vote in the Congress, not clear at all that it would successful, which would have left the president with authority, certainly, with executive authority to act. But since it had become a public debate, it would have been a much more difficult decision for him to make.\nI do think that not being able to follow through on it cost us. I am certain of that. That still comes back in conversations that people have with me, both here at home and\u2014and people from other countries, but I do think it was a net positive to get as much of the chemical weapons out as we could, and there was no way we could have done that without Russian cooperation. I think there was hope after that kind of cooperation produced positive results that then, we could go back to talking more broadly with the Russians about what needed to be done in Syria and what needed to be done with Assad. They did not reciprocate on that. So you know, I think it's like much in\u2014in international relations, it's a\u2014it's a mixed picture, some positive, you know, some\u2014some negative.\nWith respect to the refugees, I have said I think that you know, we're coming up on the U.N. General Assembly. I think there should be an emergency global gathering where the U.N. literally tries to get commitments. You know, we did that with Haiti. After the Haiti earthquake, we had a huge gathering at the U.N. where literally it was like a pledging conference, where we said, \"What are you going to do?\" What\u2014you know, \"What can you contribute?\"\nAnd little countries to big countries all stepped up and it was a great show of support in the face of a terrible natural disaster. We need to do something similar, and I've\u2014I've publicly called on the U.N. to convene such a gathering. I do it again today in front of all of you.\nThe United States has to be at the table, has to be leading it. We were in a strong position to do that on Haiti. I think, even though it's not on our doorstep, we have a real interest in working not just with our European friends, I think this is a global responsibility. And if you're too far away or for whatever reason you don't think you can take refugees then you have to contribute money.\nYou should be supporting not only those refugees fleeing, but the incredible work that Jordan and Lebanon and Turkey have been doing, and they have not gotten the financial support they need. In fact, the last I checked, the U.N. appeal had only reached 37 percent, so there is both financial work and contributions that need to be forthcoming and countries need to be more open and willing to take refugees.\nI obviously want the United States to do our part but I also want this to be a global response. So I hope that with all these leaders gathered, with Pope Francis addressing the United Nations General Assembly in just about two weeks, we can see something like that very visible with people literally making their commitments nation by nation, or in the case of the EU or other organizations as well.\nINDYK: I think we're going to have to close it out, but I see two hands going up. Do you mind taking two together? First is Ivan and then Joe.\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, I also want to add my thanks for a very forceful, unequivocal, and clear speech bringing a position that sounds eminently defensible. One of the silver linings potentially of the Iran deal is an alignment of interest in the region between Israel and the moderate Arab countries, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, et cetera\u2014the gulf states. If you agree with that, how would you see capitalizing on those shared interests, those concerns about Iran going forward? How would you promote the shared interests as a way of bridging more peace to the region?\nINDYK: Joe, quick question?\nQUESTION: Joe (Santioni), the pleasure is mine. Thank you for your measured and fact based approach to this. Let me bring you to the politics of the issue. What explains that we don't have a single Republic senator in support of this? Is this is ideological divide between the parties? Or raw partisan politics?\nCLINTON: Well I'll restrain myself and answer the first questions first. I think there is an opportunity here to succeed, I really do. I don't think it's easy. But let's just go back a few years.\nNot so long ago, Israel and Turkey were working very closely together on a number of issues. Then came the flotilla and then came the response by the Israeli military, then came many years of you know, real hard feelings that got harder and harder and we lost what was a\u2014not just a - a working relationship but a real bridge.\nSimilarly, there have been a number of instances where in the past, Israel has worked in common concert with a number of the gulf countries. Israel is now back in a very productive relationship with Egypt, obviously with Jordan. So there are the pieces of national and regional interests here that I think very diligently and probably frustratingly could be pulled back together.\n\u00a0I don't\u2014I don't know that it's something the United States can lead, but it's certainly something that we can try to catalyze and encourage. And I think there is potential there because as I said in my speech, I will do everything I can to convince Turkey and (Qatar) that supporting Hamas is not in their interest. It's not in the region's interest. It's certainly not in Egypt's interest. They both care deeply about, you know, what happens in Egypt for somewhat different reasons than others, but they care.\nAnd so I think we have to build the case and I think American diplomats could help build that case. And then look for ways\u2014I mean, I spent, you know, literally years trying to get the Israelis to finally apologize to the Turks on the flotilla. And there was a memorable day during one of my vacations where I was literally, you know, talking to the Israelis. I was talking to Henry Kissinger. I was talking to everybody I could find to make the strategic argument which we all believed, that the sooner Israel did that, the sooner they could get back to some kind of discussion perhaps.\nFinally that happened when President Obama went to Israel. And I was very happy that, you know, now we have a different Turkey with a different kind of, set of challenges, but interests remain the same. Turkey's interest for stability are not so different than they were, even though some of the leadership attitudes seem to have altered. So I would like to see us do everything we can. I would make a high priority of that.\nI hope that this administration in the last, you know, year-and-a-half or so of it, term, will be similarly doing that because, let's start seeing what we can do. It kind of goes back to Robin's question. You know, you don't know what you can achieve until you try to put the pieces together. And I think the more we can try to put those pieces together, the more we'll know whether or not something can come up.\nWith respect to the lack of support for the agreement, honestly, I think it's\u2014it's\u2014it's in some instances genuine. Just as I said in my remarks, there are people who I deeply respect on the Democratic side certainly and I would respect them on the Republican side as well, who just have concerns that they don't feel have been answered. But I think the driving force behind it is, you know, to close ranks against the president, against this kind of diplomacy, but without offering an alternative.\nAnd that's what I find, I mean I don't mind debating alternatives. I mean, when we did the New Start Treaty, it was really hard to get the votes for that. I remember, you know, going up and making the case, but we got some Republican votes. But we're living in a very partisan atmosphere right now. And I do think we have to do more. Just as we, and I'll end with this by saying, just as we have to in diplomacy, reach out to people constantly, if not to persuade them to join with us, to eliminate an argument that they have, that they won't join, because they have been consulted. They have been brought along, they have been briefed. We have to do that with the Congress as well. And it's not\u2014it's not easy if they don't even have open minds.\nBut we still have to do it so we can be in the position of saying, you know, \"We told you this, we offered you this, we briefed you this, we gave you this information and you haven't come forth with any kind of, you know, rational, or rationale to oppose us.\u00a0 You're just opposing us. So it's\u2014it's\u2014it's very political, after discounting those who I think are\u2014are genuinely skeptical.\nINDYK: Madame Secretary Hillary, thank you very much for\u2014for a very powerful series and\u2014and clear-headed explication of your position on Iran, Middle East and even broader. This is precisely what we expect from you and precisely what we at Brookings want to try to promote in this presidential debate, so we are very grateful to you.\nPlease join me in thanking Hillary. [applause]\n","13":"\nMARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:\u00a0 And now Mr. Trump, who has been leading the Republican primary polls, has nearly caught up to Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchup, the latest CNN\/ORC poll finding Trump has closed to within 6 points of Hillary Clinton after trailing 16 points just last month.\nJoining me right now on the phone is Republican front runner Donald Trump.\u00a0 Donald Trump, great to have you on the program.\u00a0 Thanks so much joining us.\u00a0 \nDONALD TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you, Maria. Nice to be with you.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Congratulations on closing the gap on Hillary.\u00a0 I want to ask you about that and about this e-mail controversy.\nLet me begin on the breaking news this morning, Donald, because the AP has uncovered a document showing that Iran will be allowed to use its own inspectors to investigate a site that has repeatedly been accused of developing nuclear arms.\u00a0 How concerned are you about this deal?\u00a0 And what would you do about it in the president's office? \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, that's incredible statement.\u00a0 I've just heard this too.\u00a0 And, look, it's one of the worst deals I have ever seen.\u00a0 It's like negotiated by babies, by incompetent people.\u00a0 And now on top of everything else, on top of the 24 days and the long period before you get to the 24 days, on top of not getting our prisoners back, on top of all of the other things, the 25 different points, they can inspect their own site? I mean, you must be kidding.\u00a0 It's just hard to believe, hard to fathom.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 How do you manage your own policy when it comes to foreign issues?\u00a0 We've got Iran.\u00a0 We've got, a fight with ISIS, not to mention other conflicts around the world.\u00a0 How would you characterize your foreign policy?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I think my foreign policy would be very fair but very, very tough and I would strengthen up our military, I'll take care of our vets.\u00a0 Our vets are treated horribly, by the way.\u00a0\u00a0 But we will strengthen up our military, and nobody is going to be messing with us.\u00a0 And I certainly wouldn't be making deals like we did with Iran.\u00a0 You know, we're going to make -- Iran is going to be absolutely a superpower.\u00a0 They're getting $150 billion, and sadly they get that whether the deal happens or not. That's like a signing bonus.\u00a0 \nThat's a tremendous amount of money.\u00a0 They're getting $150 billion and much more than that, over term.\u00a0 And it's just inconceivable that a deal -- I don't know, they just wanted to make it.\u00a0 You know, you do business, all right.\u00a0 And probably most of the people watching your show probably cannot understand how a thing like this could happen.\nWe were so desperate to get this deal.\u00a0 We should have doubled up and tripled up the sanctions and made a deal the way it has to be made.\u00a0 We dealt with -- from weakness, we had bad negotiators, we had bad everything.\u00a0 You know, one of the things I've done is, on trade pacts, I have spoken to Carl Icahn, who's a friend of mine, a good friend of mine, and others of the great dealmakers and negotiators, and they're going to represent me, if I win.\u00a0 And they're going to represent our country on trade deals.\u00a0 We're going to get best dealers in the world, and we have them.\nI saw Charlie Gasparino on your show, and he understands when I mentioned Carl and I mentioned some of these other names -- these are the people that we need negotiating for us, not diplomats and not people that have no business ability.\u00a0 When you look at Secretary Kerry and the deal that he made, it's such an embarrassment to our country.\u00a0 And now you tell us that they can inspect their sites themselves?\u00a0 It's incredible.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 In fact, you've mentioned Carl Icahn would be part of the Trump administration.\u00a0 Who would you have as Secretary of State?\u00a0 Have you thought about Cabinet positions?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 No, I haven't done that.\u00a0 Actually what I have done is I said to Carl, I said Carl -- in fact, I had dinner with him the other night.\u00a0 I said, Carl, you're great at this.\u00a0 I'm great at this.\u00a0 We have -- there aren't too many of us.\u00a0 We need to bring our country back.\u00a0 Our trade deals are so bad.\nI said would you like to -- supposing I let you run, you know, be involved with China, would be involved with Japan -- Japan sends us cars -- I was in Los Angeles, two weeks ago.\u00a0 I saw ships come in, the biggest ships I have ever seen, with cars from Japan.\u00a0 And, you know, we give them beef and they don't even want to take.\u00a0 We sell them wheat.\u00a0 It's ridiculous.\nSo I said to Carl what do you say?\u00a0 And, oh, I'd love it, I'd love it.\u00a0 Carl would love it.\u00a0 I mean, you should call Carl.\u00a0 I mean, Carl would love it.\nAnd, you know, with people like Carl and others that we know, and others that you -- that are on your show, if you know the good ones and so do I, and we also know bad ones.\u00a0 We don't use bad ones.\u00a0 But with -- you know, you put let's say Carl in charge and some others in charge, you know you're going to come out, it's going to come out great.\u00a0 It is going to come out so good for us.\nSo, I mean, my policy would be a smart policy.\u00a0 It would it be tough but it would be fair.\u00a0 But we'd bring our country back; we'd bring our jobs back.\u00a0 We are losing our jobs, we're losing our base, we're losing our money.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes.\nTRUMP:\u00a0 And then the amazing thing is we owe China right now $1.4 trillion.\u00a0 You know they do this and w -- by the way, the same amount we owe Japan 1$.4 trillion.\u00a0 So it's like a magic act to them. They take everything and then we owe them money.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 You've talked about Carl Icahn.\u00a0 What about a running mate?\u00a0 Would you -- have you thought about that?\u00a0 Rick Perry told me earlier he would ask Carly Fiorina perhaps to be his running mate.\u00a0 Is there anyone in the GOP field right now that you would consider as a running mate? \nTRUMP:\u00a0 It just too soon.\u00a0 I mean, I've gotten to know a lot of the candidates.\u00a0 Well, I know so many people in -- as you know, because you have known me a long time, I've been very involved politically for many years, and I know -- I know tremendous people in the world of politics, too, although, generally speaking, the politicians are not going to bring us to the promised land.\u00a0 That I can tell you.\u00a0 It's not - [Crosstalk]\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Let me ask you about -- you've mentioned obviously -- put this immigration story on the table, in particular with Mexico, we've heard all about your plans for neighbor to the south.\u00a0 What about our neighbor to the north, Donald?\u00a0 We've got security concerns about terrorists crossing that border with Canada, worries about terror cells in large cities like Minneapolis.\u00a0 Do we need a wall there too?\u00a0 And what's the answer to some of these open spots?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 We don't need a wall there.\u00a0 It's a much different situation.\u00a0 And frankly in terms of Canada, what -- you look at what's going on with Canada, it's a much different kind of situation that we have with Canada.\u00a0 We have to police it; we have to be very vigilant; we have to be careful.\u00a0 But also the length, you're talking about a tremendous length, a tremendous distance.\nYou know, interestingly, the wall on southern border, it's -- really, if you think it's 1,000 miles but it's 2,000 miles, but a lot of it -- some of it's done -- it's done poorly by the way, what they have done is very poor, very poor work, a very poor job, and very -- not much of a wall.\u00a0 But you also have natural terrain which is automatically a barrier, which is a good thing.\u00a0 So you're talking about 1,000.\u00a0 And then you look at the Great Wall of China that was built 2,500 years ago.\u00a0 It's 13,000 miles.\u00a0 And we're really talking about something more than a little more than 1,000 miles.\nSo it is something that can be absolutely done, not done at tremendous cost.\u00a0 You know, it's been costed by politicians and they came out with these outrageous numbers.\u00a0 As you know, I know how to build.\u00a0 I know how to get it done.\u00a0 We'll have a great wall.\u00a0 We'll call it the Great Wall of Trump.\u00a0 We'll have a great wall and it will be -- it'll be actually -- it can be a good-looking wall, as walls go, but we will have a really terrific wall and it will be gone for the right price.\nYou know, for years, they've wanted to do it.\u00a0 I don't know if you know, even Hillary Clinton, I mean, for years they've wanted to do it, but they could never get it figured out how to get it done.\u00a0 And, you know, one of the things that stopped it was the environmental impact statement.\u00a0 Can you believe it? \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Unbelievable.\u00a0 Well --\nTRUMP:\u00a0 They couldn't get an environmental impact statement completed to get the wall built.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 That's a whole 'nother conversation.\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 That's a whole 'nother conversation.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 You said it's going to be the Great Wall of Trump.\u00a0 Does that mean you're going to put your name on it?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 No, I'm only -- I'm only being facetious.\u00a0 [laughter]\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 You are a builder.\u00a0 You are a builder, Donald, and you've built so much in the city.\u00a0 You're a New Yorker.\u00a0 Have you seen the city change under Mayor Bill de Blasio?\u00a0 \nT\u00a0 Well, it is changing and some people are not happy about it.\u00a0 We're going to have to see what happens.\u00a0 It's still a little bit early but some people are not happy about what's going on.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Let me ask you about Hillary and the e-mail scandal.\u00a0 You just released this ad that we all just watched.\u00a0 Do you believe she broke the law?\u00a0 Do you think there is criminality here?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I think there is no question about it.\u00a0 I think the one advantage she has is that the prosecutors are Democrats.\u00a0 And she seems not -- I think they maybe won't prosecute her.\u00a0 And a lot of people are watching to to see whether or not they are honorable in that respect, because if you look at General Petraeus , what he did is a tiny fraction of what she's done.\u00a0 First of all, those documents were far less important than the documents that she's talking about.\u00a0 And, you know, so many mistakes were made by her and so many lies were made, and you would think that if they did that to General Petraeus where they\u00a0 virtually destroyed his life, they went after him, I mean, and if hers is a far more serious set of documents, and far more documents, you would really think that something has to happen.\u00a0 But I think she is shielded.\u00a0 And interestingly she better hope that a Republican doesn't get in , because you have 6 year statute of limitations.\nBut she did something that is very serious and yet I have a feeling she probably, possibly, won't be prosecuted only because she is protected by her own party.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes, she was very flippant about it, too.\u00a0 You know, she made a joke about Snapchat, and she's got a Snapchat account that deletes --\nTRUMP:\u00a0 Yes, she should not have made that joke, because that's sort of throwing in it their face.\u00a0 She should not have made that joke, but, you know, we will have to see.\u00a0 A lot of people are watching to see what they do.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Let me ask you about some of the issues that are important to the American people, Donald, and that is wages and tax reform.\u00a0 What's your plan for tax reform.\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, we have to simplify because -- you know, I have a little cute statement. \"I want H&amp;R Block out of business.\"\u00a0 And it's so complicated, people that are making $50,000 a year, $60,000 dollars a year, they have go and pay a lot of money to tax, you know, these firms that do this stuff.\u00a0 It's ridiculous.\u00a0 We have to, at a minimum, we have to simplify.\u00a0 And I'm going to be coming out over the next four weeks with a I think a really comprehensive, like I did on immigration -- I'm very proud of that because now everybody is taking about immigration and illegal immigration.\u00a0 And if I wasn't involved, Maria, you know, they wouldn't be talking about it.\u00a0 They wouldn't -- I don't think immigration would even come up as a presidential point to be discussed.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Well --\nTRUMP:\u00a0 I think that what I'm going to be doing with taxes will be similar, maybe less dramatic actually. But similar.\u00a0 We have to simplify our system.\u00a0 At a minimum we have to simplify our system and I would like to see a reduction in taxes.\u00a0 And we have to simplify our taxes.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Reduction in corporate taxes or all taxes, what?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 Oh absolutely -- a reduction in all taxes but especially corporate and especially for the middle class.\u00a0 I mean, what we are doing to our middle class is inconceivable.\u00a0 It's terrible.\u00a0 You know, this country was sort of built by the middle class, it is one of those facts of life, and we are really treating them badly and they're disappearing, so we've got to take care of them.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 So you're saying you could cut taxes.\u00a0 You would cut taxes.\nTRUMP:\u00a0 I would cut taxes.\u00a0 And the other thing, in terms of cutting taxes, people think cut taxes?\u00a0 We pay the highest taxes in the world.\u00a0 At almost every level, we're the highest taxed nation in the world.\u00a0 And then when you add regulatory to it, from your standpoint from your ,you know, a lot of your corporate executives that are watching, the regulatory burdens that this country faces are second to none. And add that on, almost call that a tax.\u00a0 \nSo a lot of things will change, and we would unleash that is the greatness that is this country. \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 So, for example, on Dodd-Frank, would you move to roll that back?\u00a0 Would you change some of the --\nTRUMP:\u00a0 I would at a minimum roll that back.\u00a0 We'd get rid -- you know, if people have a lot of money, if I go to bank, I can get whatever I want because you don't need money.\u00a0 If people are really good and they're building a company but they need some help from a bank, you can't get money today.\u00a0 Even at low interest rates, you can't get money.\u00a0 It's the weirdest thing.\nThe people that need money can't get money; the people that don't need money can have all the money they want.\u00a0 The regulators are controlling the banks.\u00a0 I wouldn't want to be banker, I'll be honest with you.\u00a0 It is so regulated and so tough, and these bankers, I deal with them, the biggest guys, they're friends of mine, and they're petrified of -- they're literally petrified of the regulators.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes, well, you make a really good point because certainly things have changed in that world.\nWages, Donald, they haven't moved in seven years.\u00a0 People are not feeling this economic recovery because they haven't seen any changes in their salary.\u00a0 What's the solution to moving the needle on wages for the American people.\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 I don't think there is a recovery, first of all.\u00a0 If you look, we have 93 million people that really are out of work.\u00a0 And if you look at the real number of unemployment -- you know, I actually heard a number the other day, 42 percent, but I've always -- I've been saying, from 19 to 21 percent, if you really look at the numbers.\u00a0 And this nonsense about 5.4, 5.3 percent, it's total nonsense.\u00a0 And what we have to do is bring jobs back.\u00a0 We have to stop with the China, with the Japan, with even Mexico.\u00a0 Nabisco now is moving their -- a big, big factory, they're moving a big plant from Chicago to Mexico.\u00a0 Ford is building a massive building, a massive assembly plant in Mexico, $2.5 billion.\u00a0 So many other things, like Mexico is becoming the new China.\u00a0 We have to keep our jobs, Maria.\u00a0 You see al the time.\u00a0 I mean, you are seeing it.\nAnother thing, interesting, and I'm going to start talking about it big, is corporate inversion.\u00a0 The money that's out there and the corporations that are leaving this country now.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 So you mean a foreign company acquiring an American company just to improve their tax story?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Not even that.\u00a0 An American company buying a foreign company and then moving.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Same thing, right.\u00a0 [Crosstalk]\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 And they improve their tax story.\nTRUMP:\u00a0 Whereas you have an American company going, and then you have -- they say probably and nobody really knows the number but it's massive, 2 and half trillion dollars out there where companies can't bring the money back.\u00a0 Some of these companies now, Maria, are going out to get money, which is bad because they're taking the company with them, and that means the jobs and all of the other things.\nYou know, a lot of the people that you interview, and I see it, they're international people.\u00a0 They come from London, they come from other countries.\u00a0 They run even -- they run American companies and they're from different -- they don't care about our country.\u00a0 They will move if lower taxes.\u00a0 If they have lower wages, if they have -- they'll move the -- and you see all the time.\u00a0 But they have to allow that money to come back into this country.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 So how are you going to balance this?\u00a0 Because you are saying a lot of things here.\u00a0 I mean, on one hand, you know, you want to make sure that we've got trade deals in place, you want to do trade -- better deals with Japan, better deals with China.\u00a0 And at the same time, you're saying you don't want any illegals here and it sounds a little protectionist.\u00a0 Do you find that you're a protectionist?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 No, I'm not.\u00a0 I'm a free trader, but the problem with free traders is you need smart leaders and we don't have smart leaders.\u00a0 You need great negotiators and we don't have great negotiators.\u00a0 We're not using our great negotiators; we're using diplomats, we're political hacks.\u00a0 We're using people to negotiating with China, and Japan, and we're using -- and the, by the way, I use them as examples, but we don't make good deals with anybody.\u00a0 Every country that does business with us walks away laughing.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Let me ask you about this space story.\u00a0 President Obama has been setting his sights on Mars, spending money to get U.S. there.\u00a0 But we have the Chinese trying to target our satellites in space, namely our military satellites.\u00a0 What would Trump space program look like?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I wouldn't be thinking about Mars.\u00a0 I'd be thinking about getting our country fixed first, OK?\u00a0 Before we worry about Mars, wI'd be thinking about our infrastructure, our bridges that are falling down, our airports that are third world.\u00a0 You go to some of these places -- like you go to Qatar and you go to any -- I mean,, so many places in China --\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Singapore. Singapore's gorgeous, the airport.\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Singapore.\u00a0 You look at their airports and their highways and their roads, and their everything, their infrastructure, and then you come back at home and you land at LaGuardia, you land at JFK, you land at LAX or Newark, and it's third world airports.\u00a0 It's so sad what has happened to our country.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Right, that's absolutely right.\u00a0 But where does the money come from, Donald, to pay for it?\u00a0 You're saying all, you know, very important things, in terms of infrastructure in this country, but will you have to raise taxes to get there?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 No, it comes from cutting costs.\u00a0 We are tremendously bloated.\u00a0 It comes from cutting costs and it comes from bringing back jobs from these other places.\u00a0 And it comes from fairness.\u00a0 You know, China devalued, as you know, because you covered it very big a few days ago, China devalued, the biggest in two decades.\u00a0 Nobody thought they'd do that again.\u00a0 They have been devaluing their currency now and they're making it impossible for our companies to compete.\u00a0 We can't allow this to happen.\u00a0 So we -- and as you know, we can do things.\u00a0 We have tremend -- we have so many cards over China..\u00a0 People say, oh well, they have the power over us.\u00a0 It's really wrong.\u00a0 We have the power.\u00a0 We have rebuilt China.\u00a0 If you think about it, the money they have taken out from our country, alone.\u00a0 Now they have done it in a smaller way to Europe and other places, but they've taken out of the United States, we've rebuilt China.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Well, part of the issue is the dollar is so strong here.\u00a0 Do you think the dollar is too strong?\u00a0 Do you have a strong dollar policy?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, you know, the beauty that is China so we owe them $1.4 trillion.\u00a0 They did it when it was weak and now it's strong, so they're making it on that end and they're also making it with trade, all\u00a0 the money they're making.\u00a0 I mean, they're making it every different way.\u00a0 The dollar is hurting us, there's no question about it.\u00a0 I mean, these companies can't compete.\u00a0 A friend of mine is in the excavation business and he just ordered Komatsu tractors, Komatsu.\u00a0 He always ordered Cats, right?\u00a0 He's a big Caterpillar guy.\u00a0 And he\u00a0 ended up ordering Komatsu excavators.\u00a0 And I said, why?\u00a0 He said it was impossible for anybody to compete.\u00a0 \nNice equipment. I said is equal?\u00a0 Eh, maybe not.\u00a0 So it's not equal.\u00a0 He hated doing it. He was depressed over doing it, but he ends up buying Komatsu, which is Japanese, and it's all because they've cut the hell out of the yen also.\u00a0 So I think the dollar is going to hurt us very badly, the strong dollar.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 What do you do though?\u00a0 Do you want to rein it in?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, maybe they're going to have to.\u00a0 Look, we're going to lose a lot of business with it.\u00a0 You know, the strong dollar sounds good.\u00a0 It sounds good to say we have a strong dollar.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 That's what they always say, but they don't do it.\nTRUMP:\u00a0 That's about where it stops, because, you know, if you look at it, you can say we have a strong dollar, we have a strong currency, and there are certain advantages to that, but there are certain huge disadvantages.\u00a0 And the disadvantage is our companies are really suffering.\u00a0 It's very hard for Caterpillar and a lot of these other companies -- look at their stock.\u00a0 I saw their stock the other day, it's bad.\u00a0 It's very hard for these companies to compete when you have, you know, China, Japan, knocking the hell out of their currency.\u00a0 It's very hard.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 So as the leader the free world, what do you do about it, Donald?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 You have to have respect.\u00a0 You have to have them not do that.\u00a0 And if they do that, you're going to have to put a tariff on their goods coming in to equalize it.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 OK, so you're talking about tariffs.\u00a0 You're talking about -- \nTRUMP:\u00a0 You have no other choice.\u00a0 Well, you have no other choice.\u00a0 I don't want tariffs.\u00a0 Hey look, let's face it.\u00a0 China does tariffs on us like crazy.\u00a0 I have neater friend who's a manufacturer.\u00a0 He can't get goods into China.\u00a0 And when he does -- and he's a really good manufacturer, really good.\u00a0 When he does get them in they charge him a tariff and it's a massive -- he gave me a number which I won't even say because I can't even believe it.\u00a0 But they charge him massive tariffs to get his stuff into China. They've put their stuff in and we don't charge anything.\u00a0 So for people who think there's free trade, free trade is only good when you have smart people on your side.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes, it's interesting.\u00a0 Good analysis.\nAll right, Jeb Bush took a real shot at you last night in New Hampshire.\u00a0 Why don't you listen to this?\u00a0 Get your reaction to this, Donald.\u00a0 Listen to this.\u00a0 \n[BEGIN VIDEO CLIP]\nJEB BUSH [R], PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0 When people look at his record, it is not a conservative record.\u00a0 Even on immigration, where it's, you know, look, it's -- the language is -- is -- pretty vitriolic, for sure, but hundreds of billions of dollars of cost to implement his plans is not a conservative plan.\u00a0 \n[END VIDEO CLIP]\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Donald, are you a conservative?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 I am.\u00a0 And, you know, interestingly Ronald Reagan was a Democrat.\u00a0 I was a Democrat also, and Ronald Reagan was a Democrat and he became not a very conservative president.\u00a0 He became a Republican and he was pretty consecutive, as we talk about conservatives.\nI've really very much evolved over years.\u00a0 And, you know, coming from Manhattan, where you live also, there is no such thing as anything but a Democrat.\u00a0 You know that. We grow up in an atmosphere, but I have always been a conservative person and my bent has been conservative.\u00a0 And over last number of years when I started getting very political, I starting seeing more and more that that is my -- that is my leaning and that is my strong leaning.\u00a0 And I think people see that, and I think they see that with the various plans and my various statements over a period of time.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 So are you a moderate conservative?\u00a0 I mean, would you say that you are liberal on social issues and conservative on fiscal issues?\u00a0 Is that a fair statement?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I'm certainly -- I'm conservative, I'm very conservative on fiscal issues.\u00a0 I would say on social I'm, you know, I'm on the conservative side.\u00a0 I would certainly say on something like immigration, I'm very conservative, because what's happening at the border and I -- look, I was the one that pointed it out.\u00a0 If it weren't for me, they wouldn't be talking about immigration right now, Maria.\u00a0 And I was the one that pointed it out.\nWe are having a crime wave, we are having tremendous loss of jobs, and other things, and we have to solve the problems of illegal immigration.\u00a0 Illegal immigration has turned out to be\u00a0 -- and on that I'm very conservative. \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 So that's going to be your first item on the agenda in the Oval Office, immigration?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 I would really say first of many.\u00a0 We have to do so many things.\u00a0 We have to repeal Obamacare and come up with a much better solution, you know, it's just a disaster, it's turned out to be a disaster.\u00a0 I don't know if you know but Obamacare really kicks in in '16.\u00a0 The numbers are catastrophic for this country in terms of what it's going to cost.\u00a0 It's unaffordable and it doesn't work.\u00a0 It's not good.\u00a0 I mean, the premiums -- look at the premiums.\u00a0 Look at what's happening to the premiums of people.\u00a0 Look what's happening to their deductibles, how high their deductibles are.\u00a0 I mean, you got to get hit by a Komatsu tractor in order to use it.\nSo I -- so many things.\u00a0 Maria, there are so many things that have to be done to bring this country back.\u00a0 Our country is really in bad shape, on top of which it might -- \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 How difficult is it going to be to do all this, Donald?\u00a0 I mean, you're saying it's the first of many things.\u00a0 You've got immigration reform.\u00a0 You've got Obamacare you're going to repeal.\u00a0 You say you're going to roll back Dodd-Frank.\u00a0 I mean have you thought about the timing in terms of priorities your first year in office?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, things could be done quickly.\u00a0 You have great people.\u00a0 You get great people.\u00a0 I know great people.\u00a0 Many of those people are on your shows, you know, to be honest with you.\u00a0 But -- and, you know, these are people that make a lot of money, but when they get the opportunity to serve the country, every single one of them -- like when I call Carl Icahn, I said, Carl, if I had you involved in the negotiations with China, would you do it?\u00a0 Oh, I would love it.\u00a0 \nHe would love to do it.\u00a0 As rich and as busy as some of these people are, they would love to do it.\u00a0 Not money, it's not a question of money.\u00a0 They get nothing for this.\u00a0 But --\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 There is a real movement in terms of short termism versus long termism and Carl Icahn is part of that on the short termism.\u00a0 I wonder what you have to say about that, and this article in \"The Journal\" today that basically says, look, let's do away with quarterly earnings.\u00a0 Are we too short term thinking when it comes to money?\u00a0 And what about the private equity part of business, which basically is being criticized for, you know, activist investing and short term thinking? \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I think the short term is terrible and I think it is hurting the company.\u00a0 You know, the nice part about a company like mine, I'm a private company, I can do whatever I want.\u00a0 I can paint the ceiling and say what's my return on investment?\u00a0 I don't think about it.\u00a0 Whereas they don't want to do that.\u00a0 You know, just to use a, you know, as an example, they don't want to spend 10 cents on doing anything because they're so worried about the border.\nSo, look, I think you're not going to change the system. The system is the system.\u00a0 They want quarterly reports.\u00a0 I mean they want daily reports, frankly.\u00a0 If they could get daily reports, they would be happy with it.\u00a0 But ultimately in many cases it's not a great thing for a company.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Who do you admire in foreign policy, in the military, and in business, that you would like to emulate some of those policies?\u00a0 Putting Carl Icahn aside; I know you're a big fan and highly complimentary.\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I mean, you know, it's such a big question because you're talking about many, many names, and I'll leave out so many and they'll be insulted.\u00a0 But when you look at business, a guy like Jack Welch.\u00a0 I've always been a fan of Jack; I've always liked Jack.\u00a0 I actually did deals with Jack when he was at General Electric.\u00a0 And somebody like Jack Welch was certainly a great example.\nAnd there are so many of them.\u00a0 I've met so many corporate leaders, over the years, over the last four or five years in particular, and so many that are so good.\u00a0 And people like, as an example, Larry Fink, I invest money, I put money with different people, and Larry Fink -- done a great job, you know, he's done a great job for me. And, you know, with the money that I have given them to invest.\u00a0 \nAnd others -- there are so many people that I have great respect for.\u00a0 Unfortunatel, there are far more people that don't do a very good job.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 What would you do in terms of all of your wealth?\u00a0 I mean, in terms of avoiding any conflict.\u00a0 Would you put it in a blind trust?\u00a0 How would you deal with that?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I'd do whatever you're supposed to do.\u00a0 I guess I would put it in a trust or a blind trust, and you know Ivanka and my boys, and I have a lot of great executives.\u00a0 They'd run the company.\u00a0 The company is -- you know, you saw the numbers.\u00a0 I mean, the company is a great company.\u00a0 It's very liquid.\u00a0 We have very little debt.\u00a0 We have tremendous cash flow, and it's a great company.\u00a0 I tell them don't do deals.\u00a0 Just don't do anything.\u00a0 Just relax and run it properly.\u00a0 You know, it's a big company and I'd want them to run it properly.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 So you wouldn't be interested in putting any family members in the administration?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 No, I wouldn't do that.\u00a0 I think that would probably not happen.\u00a0\u00a0 I think that frankly if I did, if I put Ivanka in some position, I think she'd do it fantastically.\u00a0 You know her; she's -- probably she's a friend of yours, actually.\u00a0 She thinks the world of you.\nBut if I put Ivanka in just about any position you name, she'd do a great job.\u00a0 But I don't think I'd do that, no.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Well, let me get your one word sentence describing your opinions on each of these leaders.\u00a0 I'd love to get you to sort of respond to some -- your quick thoughts on somebody like Angela Merkel.\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Fantastic leader.\u00a0 She's -- I was with somebody the other day who thinks she is greatest leader in the world today.\u00a0\u00a0 She's the most -- she's the smartest and the greatest leader in the world today, and this is a person that has great knowledge of her and deals with her.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 David Cameron.\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Um, good.\u00a0 Fought back a tremendous threat because that would have been the whole Scotland situation I think good.\u00a0 I deal with him a little bit.\u00a0 I think very good.\u00a0 I think he's becoming better with time, actually.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 How about Vladimir Putin?\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Uh, I actually think that he is somebody that can be dealt with.\u00a0 I think his dislike of President Obama is so intense that it really has affected the whole relationship.\u00a0 We've driven them into the arms of China, so that now these two are together, which is also a been the great sin.\u00a0 Don't ever let Russia and China get together.\u00a0 We've driven them together.\u00a0 I think he is somebody that I would have a very decent relationship with if I ever win.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 How about Xi in China?\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Always smart.\u00a0 Chinese leaders are -- they have a different system than ours.\u00a0 They don't do it by television, they do it by a different route to get up there.\u00a0 Always smart and certainly he's been very smart.\u00a0 I think what he did with the recent devaluations, which a lot of people said were market driven, they are not market driven.\u00a0 They did it to keep it going.\u00a0 But the -- the leaders in China always turn out to be smart, and he's certainly one of them.\nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 What would you do to deal with the devaluation of the currency there?\u00a0 I mean, what's the solution there?\nTRUMP:\u00a0 Well, what you're going to have to do is you're going to have you talk to them and say, folks, you can't do this and you're going to have to tariff it. Because if you don't, we're going to lose all our business, and that goes with Japan also, by the way.\u00a0 You're going to have to do -- look what they're doing with the yen.\u00a0 And they brag about it.\u00a0 And it's almost like Obama, he's got so many other problems or he's asleep at the wheel, and he's not doing anything, Maria.\u00a0 He's not doing anything about it, but look at what's happening with the yen.\u00a0 They're doing the same thing.\u00a0 \nM:\u00a0 Donald, we've got a lot of questions for you on Twitter and Facebook.\u00a0 And J.F. Evans is asking how you stand on the Second Amendment.\u00a0 A lot of gun owners want to know, and if he is for it and whether or not you have an opinion here.\u00a0 \nTRUMP:\u00a0 Very strong on the Second Amendment; I am a Second Amendment professional.\u00a0 I love the Second Amendment.\u00a0 We have to protect our rights -- and very, very strong.\u00a0 He will be very happy with me on the Second Amendment.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO:\u00a0 Donald, when doing polls throughout the first debate and after the debate, the polls centered on two major issues that were important to American people -- wages and jobs, and No. 2, race in America.\u00a0 We saw another unfortunate, horrible tragedy in St. Louis this morning and last night.\u00a0 What's the answer to bringing us together and -- and improving race in America? \nTRUMP:\u00a0 So when Obama got elected, the one thing some people thought, including me, I thought that he would be a unifier.\u00a0 He'd be, you know, a great really unifier.\u00a0 He would bring that together, he would get people together, and I really saw that and I really hoped that and I think he had the ability to do that.\nAnd unfortunately he has been a great divider.\u00a0 There has been a great division. We are far worse than we were before he took office.\u00a0 And I'm surprised at that and that shouldn't have been.\u00a0 But we need spirit. You know, the country does not have a lot of spirit. \nThere is a lot of -- there is a lot of division, there is a lot of hatred. There is a lot of horrible hatred. You look at Baltimore, you look at -- actually what happened last night was very bad in St. Louis -- you look at Ferguson, you look at all of these different places and the there are many more, and they're ready to explode.\u00a0 They're ready to explode.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: So what do you do?\u00a0 I mean, what's the answer --\nTRUMP: You need spirit, you need the right attitude, but you also need jobs. You have to bring back jobs and you have to get them back quickly.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: What is the single most important answer to getting jobs back in America, creating jobs, and putting more opportunity out there for people?\nTRUMP: We need better trade deals we have to we can't let China and Japan and Mexico and all of these countries -- and I am not just -- you know, I talk about those three because they are more obvious, but we can't let all of these countries. I mean, so many more -- continuously take out -- You know, Vietnam now is a very big source, doing a tremendous job for them but not for us. \nVietnam, who would believe this, but Vietnam is taking tremendous amounts of business from the United States and producing goods for us. We have to produce our goods. We are not going to be producing anything, Maria. So we have to get better trade deals and we have -- We need much smarter people. You know, it is very -- Right now, it is a very complex situation. We have to get better people, we have to get better negotiators, we have to use our brightest, we have to use our best, and we don't do that.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: How do you find those people? I mean -\nTRUMP: I know those people.\nBARTIROMO: Government jobs, people don't want those jobs. How are you going to get the smartest people?\u00a0 \nTRUMP: I know those people, Maria. I know those people and you know those people, and -- I know people that are better than the people that are on your show.\u00a0 Better. But you've never heard of them.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: Let me get your take. You mentioned Charlie Gasparino earlier. You know, yesterday he reported that right after Labor Day, the GOP contenders are going to do a big attack against you -- \nTRUMP: I heard that.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: And -- How are you going to fight back?\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, I am a fan of Charlie and he is only a modest fan of me. I was surprised -- I thought he was a huge Trump fan. He's only a modest Trump fan and I was surprised because I'm a big fan -- Is that Charlie in the background?\nBARTIROMO: Yeah. He's in the background here.\nGASPARINO: I think you're a great businessman. \nTRUMP: Well, I love you. So far I am a good politician, too, Charlie, because I am leading in every poll. So I am going to get you to change your mind, OK?\u00a0 \nGASPARINO: All right.\u00a0 \nTRUMP: But, anyway.\nGASPARINO: All right. I can be convinced.\nTRUMP: But I do have great respect for Charlie and I like him, so -- I heard that, actually yesterday from Charlie, OK, and I know nothing about it other than what he says. In fact, I had mentioned it to somebody that I'm hearing they are going to attack me, they said where did you get it, I said I got it from Charlie. So I don't know, I hope he is wrong and if he's wrong, that's good and if he's right, I think I will survive.\u00a0 \nGASPARINO: Donald, the fundraisers are saying that, the campaigns now are so scared of you, they're coming out no, no, we are not going after Donald.\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Well, Charlie, they are getting killed. I mean, they are getting killed. The new polls -- I mean, they're getting killed. These are\u00a0 professional politicians but they don't have energy, they don't have life, and you know, one thing we know -- this -- we're doing badly, as a country, and one thing -- \nBARTIROMO: Are you worried about Joe Biden coming in?\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Wait a minute. One thing we know, Maria, for sure, we need somebody with energy, and these people don't have -- I mean, they don't have energy. We need smarts, we need everything. But you also have to have energy. When you look at Jeb and you look at some of these people, they don't have the energy that you see from some of our business leaders.\u00a0 You just don't see it.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: How about Joe Biden? The word is he's -- \nTRUMP: Well, maybe he comes in, I really don't know, I really don't care if he comes in, personally. I think Hillary is in trouble. I think she could be in big trouble. We will see what happens. Charlie would actually have a good bent on that, I would imagine. But I think she could be in very big trouble. I think Biden might come in at some point.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: Let me get your take on some off-topic headlines. Some of the lighter stuff. Tom Brady, is he getting a raw deal from the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell? What do you think?\nTRUMP: I think it's ridiculous the way they've treated him. He's a friend of mine, he's a great friend of mine. He's a great guy. I think it is terrible the way they've treated him. They've got -- you know, to go -- to spend 10 million dollars in legal fees, and now it's probably much higher than that, it is crazy what they are doing. He's their great star, let -- They ought to go back to play football. This country has bigger problems.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: What about your players? Who are you taking first in your fantasy football draft? \nTRUMP: As far as I'm concerned, you just mentioned one of the guys. I mean, Tom Brady is just a great guy and I always take Tom Brady. I have taken him for years, and if you have done some friendly bets on Tom Brady, you've done very well. \nBARTIROMO: Donald, how are you going to raise these numbers? I mean, you know, we are really getting into the nuts and bolts now of the issues. What is going to be, you know, to really move the needle for you, to continue gaining?\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Well, you know, I have 25, 26, 28 percent. One poll came out, I am 32 percent.\u00a0 And in all fairness, Maria, there is 17 people.\u00a0 You know, I mean, when you have 32 percent -- I am going to Mobile, Alabama, on Friday and we were thinking about 400, 500 people, so we took the ballroom and it turned out that was sold out in about two seconds, so they took a bigger ballroom -- then they took a convention center. Now they're talking about -- and Charlie, you have to hear this one -- like 30,000 people. They are taking the football stadium. \nSo this started out with 500 people about three days ago, and about 10 minutes later the hotel called, they said we can't handle the crowd that is calling. And literally, it could be 30,000, it could be more than 30,000, but it could be 30,000 people and they have actually had to take the football stadium. So you know, there is something going on out there. There is a movement and even though Charlie considers me a great businessman but not necessarily a politician, I don't know, maybe some day you will say I'm a better politicians -- \nGASPARINO: Well, you're -- \nTRUMP: Actually, I love being a great businessman.\u00a0 \nGASPARINO: What I admire about you is you probably haven't really spent a dime and you're No. 1 in polls. How much have spent?\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Well, I'll tell you. It's a very funny thing -- just have to report it so I can tell you -- I will do a little bragging, but, you know. So I've had so much television, like this interview -- I thought this was going to be -- Maria is brutal, Charlie. \nBARTIROMO: Oh come on Donald.\nYou know, I thought this would be 3 minutes. I just got back from New Hampshire last night where we had a tremendous success, and you know, Maria might keep me on this phone all day trying to be nice. But Charlie -- So it is funny - [Crosstalk]\nBARTIROMO: Well, this has to be a total education for you. I mean, I know you've been all around the world and you've done a lot of stuff, Donald, but this is totally different. What has been sort of your big takeaway from this whole running for president?\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Well let me just answer Charlie's question because it's sort of an interesting-- So what happened, I figured I would have spent 10 million by this point, right?\nBARTIROMO: Right. \nTRUMP: I spent nothing! \nBARTIROMO: You spent nothing?\u00a0 \nTRUMP: No -- nothing -- Charlie, I've spent zero.\nGASPARINO: You know what? You are the best politician out there.\nTRUMP: I mean zero.\u00a0 \nGASPARINO: You are the best politicians out there. \nTRUMP: No, no, listen -- No, no -- I was going to -- I figured by this point in advertising, which is the biggest expense -- I thought I would have spent 10 million dollars by about this point. But how can you do that if every show, from Fox to CNN to you guys, if every show has everything Trump and then on top of it, they have a Trump commercial, people will get sick. They'll get sick.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: It's amazing.\nTRUMP: So I haven't spent anything. I couldn't. If I did I would be -- they would laugh at me. So, so far I've been saving a lot of money.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: Then, you know, you answered a question that you would be willing to spend up to a billion dollars.\u00a0 Really?\nTRUMP: Well, I'll spend what I need. Look, if I am doing well, I'd spend what I need.\u00a0 Now, also, when you do well, you know, between the party and everything else, the money pours in. It does pour in. But I don't take, you know, I don't take. -- I've turned down a lot of money from lobbyists, guys that I know, guys that I've hired, you know, they're very good, some of them, some of them not so good.\nBut I had one guy last week, he said, I want to put 5 million dollars into your campaign. I said I don't need it, I don't want it. You know, I don't want it. You know, this is a guy, Charlie, you know, somebody that you probably know, who doesn't do it because, like, he thinks I have a wonderful personality -- \nBARTIROMO: How has the GOP been treating you, Donald? \nTRUMP: They've be treating me very well. Well, you know, as the frontrunner, they've been treating me very well. And that is why I keep that other door open because if they don't I have that other door open. And not that I want to use it -\nBARTIROMO: When you say I have that other door open, don't you think -- but don't you think running independent would just destroy the opportunity for the Republicans? I mean, are you are willing to do that and then give the election to Hillary -- \nTRUMP: I think it would -- I think it would be bad, it's something I don't want to do. I'm leading in every poll, I am leading in every state. Florida just came out, I am leading -- it was just reported that in Florida, I am leading Bush by a lot and I'm leading Rubio by a tremendous amount. No, I have a lot of properties in Florida. I own Doral, I own, you know, many, many properties in Florida. I love that state. It's an amazing state. But, you know, when you're leading the two people, you're leading the current senator and the ex governor by a lot, that's sort of nice. But it just came out 10 minutes ago.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: Would Rubio be an idea for you as a running mate?\u00a0 \nTRUMP: I mean, it could be. Certainly it could be. I like him, he's a nice guy. I have gotten to know him a little bit over the last couple months, you know, I have seen him in the dais during the debate. We had really a very good -- We have a good relationship. We'll see what happens. But, of course, he's one of the people that Charlie says is going to spend some negative -- \nGASPARINO: That is what his fundraisers are telling me.\u00a0 But they're so scared of you --\nTRUMP: Once that happens, you know, I will no longer like him. You do know that, right? [Laughter] \nBARTIROMO: Right, right. Sure. We know that.\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Then I go after him. Then I go after him.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: Then it's all guns blazing.\nGASPARINO: They are all afraid of you. Why -- you know, you seem to take a certain amount of glee in poking Jeb Bush in the eye. It's like, like -- he's like the Pillsbury doughboy and you just like to stick him.\nBARTIROMO: Yeah, why is that?\nGASPARINO: Why is that?\u00a0 It's funny, too. I have to admit it.\nTRUMP: I actually like him. I find him to be a nice person, I really do. I met him, I don't know him well, but I have seen him and met him a little bit on the trail, as we call it, right. And I find him to be a nice person.\u00a0 In New Hampshire he was sort of expected to win New Hampshire and now he's really not doing well in New Hampshire but he was expected -- so you know, I am going to hit the guy that I thought I should hit.\u00a0 \nAnd frankly, you know, I am leading New Hampshire by quite a bit, and in Iowa it was Walker, and he was expected to -- you know, he was there, he grew up there, he was the governor of the adjoining state, and I hit him very hard, and frankly, you know, I get along with him, he's a nice guy, but I said certain things that are true -- all true -- and now I am leading Iowa by a lot. So I'm leading Iowa and New Hampshire. I really go after the person -- like in business, right, you go after the person that -\nBARTIROMO: And then there is John Kasich. You know, Charles Barkley was on the radio yesterday saying his pick is John Kasich \nTRUMP: Charles said that over me, that is really surprising.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: Charles Barkley said that yesterday.\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Well that's good. Hey, look, he seems like a nice guy. I don't know him and he has been very respectful of me. In fact, he said that Trump has hit a nerve like I have never seen before. He said that. You know, it is hard to hit -- I don't want them to do that. I want them to hit me, you know -- Walker was -\nBARTIROMO: What do you mean you want them to --\nTRUMP: I will tell you, Maria, Walker was very interesting because he came up to see me like six, seven months ago, before this all started, and gave me a plaque because I supported him a little bit and all that and he gave me a plaque in my office. And he was so nice and then one of his guys said something a little\u00a0 nasty about me. I said, oh, thank goodness, and then I was able to hit him. That is what changed Iowa. You know, once I said that, that's what changed Iowa poll. So, you know, so Kasich has been so nice, and you know, I am really a counter puncher. If you look at what's happened with me and the people that I hit, it is really the people that hit me first. I don't think I hit anybody first.\u00a0 \nGASPARINO: You never take the first shot.\u00a0 \nTRUMP: I never take it. I just -- I can't. Maybe it's my weakness.\nGASPARINO: You're the Floyd Mayweather.\nTRUMP: Yeah, you know what? I think it's my weakness. If they're nice to me, I am never going to say anything bad about a person. It is terrible.\u00a0 I keep hoping for them to hit me, but it's one of those things.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: Donald, when you get into the White House, we want to know what your agenda will be. What is the most important issue that you are going to tackle?\nTRUMP: This is longest phone call I think I've ever had, Charlie. Can you believe this? [Laughter]\nGASPARINO: Yeah -- \u00a0[Crosstalk] \nTRUMP: I thought this was going to be a little quickie -- This is unbelievable.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: Yeah. We're trying to get you priorities because -- \nTRUMP: I mean, I know you are going to get great ratings -- but this is getting crazy.\nGASPARINO: Donald, I could never keep you on the phone this long. \nBARTIROMO: Donald, we appreciate it.\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Charlie, I will meet you any time you want. \nGASPARINO: Thank you, sir.\nTRUMP: Look, he was the source of great information. Somebody's going to spend 10 million dollars trying to kill me, OK? So what can I tell you?\nBARTIROMO: Well, we hope that the next time - [Crosstalk]\nTRUMP: Maria, just to finish this -- But you know, look, there are so many things. Obamacare has to be repealed and replaced, the military has to be strengthened, the vets have to be taken care of. We have to do, you know, we have to do new trade deals, we have to renegotiate our trade deals, we have to do something with Iran, because what we are inheriting is a deal made by very stupid people. And then on top of it you tell me that this report just came out where they can do their own inspections. Hey, Charlie, would you -- You are a very trusting person, right?\nGASPARINO: Yes, of course.\nTRUMP: Charlie is a very trusting person. He trusts nobody. He might trust his mother, but I am not sure about that, Maria. OK?\nGASPARINO: You guys should have met my mother.\nTRUMP: Charlie, would you trust -- would you trust Iran to do their own inspections?\u00a0 \nGASPARINO: You know, Donald -- I mean, this is why you are hitting a nerve because you boil this down to its bare essentials.\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Right. But isn't that incredible, though? I don't know if this report is a joke. Maybe it is false, but I wouldn't be surprised -- This is like, you know, Sergeant Bergdahl, right? We get Bergdahl, a traitor. They get five guys that they wanted desperately for years who are right now back in the -- You know, that is the way we -- I call him the five-for-one president. We get a traitor that we don't want -- we ought to throw him back -- and they get five guys that\u00a0 they want. That's the way we deal.\nDo you think that is enough questions for this morning, Charlie?\nBARTIROMO: Yes, it absolutely is. Donald, we so appreciate your time this morning. We hope that you come in person next time.\u00a0 \nTRUMP: Thank you. I will. I will. And take care of yourselves. You both are terrific.\u00a0 \nBARTIROMO: We'll be watching, Donald. Thank you very much. Donald Trump there.\n","14":"\nI also want to thank Jan [Bauer] for reminding us that today is the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. And I am thrilled to see the progress \u2013 she talked about some of the barriers that she faced when she came here to go to college, and how a lot of those barriers have been broken down and eliminated. What she didn't say is that in addition to the leadership Tom Harkin showed in getting the ADA passed, Jan was a strong voice in favor of that as well and an incredible witness for what it would mean.\nI think that we should acknowledge how the disabilities community has played such an important role in changing things for the better in our country. I remember my first job out of law school was with the Children's Defense Fund. I didn't want to go work for a law firm. I wanted to go to work to be an advocate, and I joined the organization started by Marian Wright Edelman, an incredible woman lawyer, African-American, first ever to pass \u2013 and be acknowledged as passing \u2013 the Mississippi state bar, and Marian started the Children's Defense Fund. When I joined, our first project in the summer of 1973 was to go door to door along with others across our country to gather evidence about why so many American children were not in school. We suspected that one of the biggest reasons was that their disabilities were not accommodated in school, and therefore they could not attend school. But we didn't know that for sure, and we wanted to find out. So I went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, saying, \"Do you have a school-aged child who's not in school?\" And I heard, yes, you know, our daughter dropped out to take care of the younger kids, or our son dropped out to go to work to help support the family. But I heard mostly that, yes, we have a blind child, a deaf child, a child in a wheelchair, a child with some other kind of disability that is not accepted in school. So we gathered up all of our evidence, and we presented it to the Congress, and that first effort resulted in passing Education for All, and all children with disabilities were given the right to go to school. That was a huge step forward for our country.\nAnd then the effort began with real conviction to try to expand the rights that people with disabilities should have in our society. Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, Tony Coelho, and then the bill was finally passed and signed by George H.W. Bush. It was a great success in showing that bipartisanship \u2013 bringing people together to solve a problem that affected millions of our fellow citizens \u2013 could actually work.\nWe've come a long way in the last 25 years. We still have work to do. We're by no means finished. And when I was Secretary of State, President Obama and I wanted to get passed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We held an event at the White House. We lined up sponsors, both in the Congress and outside, because it required the Congress \u2013 the Senate \u2013 to pass. And then we worked really hard, and the Republicans would not support it in the numbers needed. They wouldn't even listen to the pleas of their former leader, Senator Robert Dole, who as you know lost the use of an arm when he was in the military in World War II.\nSo there's a lot of unfinished business \u2013 both at home, and around the world. But I personally believe that the progress and the landmark legislation \u2013 first on education then broadly opening up transportation and buildings and employment, everything that people should be able to pursue \u2013 that that legislation was one of the real highlights of the civil rights and human rights movements in America.\nWe have our faults and we have our challenges, but there isn't any nation that has continually tried to push forward to widen the circle of opportunity the way we have. Despite the continuing problems that we face, we're going to keep doing that.\nSo I want to applaud you, Jan, and others who have been at the forefront of this movement. I want to introduce the Todds \u2013 Dale, Sara and Adam \u2013 who are here. I've turned over my twitter account to Sara to be tweeting about the challenges they face as a family with a young man who's got some challenges himself because I think we all have to recognize that as much progress as we've made, we still have work to do. So I want to thank you for being leaders and advocates on behalf of the community.\n","15":"\nCLINTON: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, President Van Zant, and thanks to everyone at the New School for welcoming us today. I'm delighted to be back.\nYou know, over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to listen to Americans' concerns about an economy that still isn't delivering for them. It's not delivering the way that it should. It still seems, to most Americans that I have spoken with, that it is stacked for those at the top.\nBut I've also heard about the hopes that people have for their future\u2014going to college without drowning in debt; starting that small business they've always dreamed about; getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement.\nPrevious generations of Americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain: if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. And when you get ahead, America gets ahead. But over the past several decades, that bargain has eroded. Our job is to make it strong again.\nFor 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules, it will trickle down, it will trickle down to everyone else. Yet every time they have a chance to try that approach, it explodes the national debt, concentrates wealth even more and does practically nothing to help hard-working Americans.\nTwice now in the past 20 years, a Democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind. [applause]\nI think the results speak for themselves. Under President Clinton\u2014I like the sound of that\u2014America saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history. [applause]\nNearly 23 million jobs, a balanced budget and a surplus for the future, and most importantly, incomes rose across the board, not just for those already at the top. Eight years later, President Obama and the American people's hard work pulled us back from the brink of depression. President Obama saved the auto industry, imposed new rules on Wall Street and provided health care to 16 million Americans. [applause]\nNow today\u2014today, as the shadow of crisis recedes and longer-term challenges come into focus, I believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy. You can't have one without the other.\u00a0 We can't create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth, and we can't build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness. We need both.\nBecause while America standing again, we are not yet running the way we should. Corporate profits are at near record highs and Americans are working as hard as ever. But paychecks had nearly budged in real terms. Families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets. Out of pocket costs of health care, child care, hearing for aging parents, are rising a lot faster than wages.\nI hear this everywhere I go. A single mom talked about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids. She doesn't expect anything to come easy. But if she got a raise, everything would not be quite so hard.\nThe grandmother who works around the clock providing child care to other people's kids. She's proud of her work, but the pay is fairly enough to live on, especially with the soaring price of her prescription drugs.\nThe young entrepreneur whose dream of buying a bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student debt. If he can grow his business, he can pay off his debt and pay his employees, including himself, more, too.\nMillions of hardworking Americans tell similar stories. Wages need to rise to keep up with cost, paychecks need to grow. Families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead. The defining economic challenge of our time clear. We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans, so they can afford a middle-class life. We must drive steady income growth that lifts up families, and lifts up our country. And that... [applause]\nAnd that will be my mission, from the first day I am president to the last. I... [applause]\nI will get up every day thinking about the families of America, like the family I came from, with a hard-working dad who started a small business and scrimped, and saved, and gave us a good middle-class life. I will be thinking about all the people that I represented in New York and the stories that they told me, and that I worked with them to improve. I will, as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop of major changes in our economy and the global economy that did not start with the Recession and will not end with the recovery.\nYou know, advances in technology and expanding global trade have created new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports. Too often they are polarizing our economy, benefiting high skilled workers, but displacing and downgrading blue-collar jobs and other mid-level jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions of Americans.\nToday's marketplace focuses too much on the short-term, like second to second financial trading, and quarterly earnings reports, and too little on long-term investments. Meanwhile, many Americans are making extra money renting out a small room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car. This on-demand, or so-called gig economy is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation.\nBut it is also raising hard questions about work-place protections and what a good job will look like in the future.\nSo, all of these trends are real and none, none is going away. But they do not determine our destiny. The choices we make as a nation matter.\u00a0 And the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what American life in the middle class and our economy will be like in this century.\nAs president, I will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents of change start working for us more than against us, to strengthen, not hollow out, the American middle class. Because I think at our best, that's what Americans do. We are problem solvers, not deniers. We don't hide from change; we harness it.\nThe measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families, not just for successful CEOs and money managers and not some just arbitrary growth targets untethered to people's lives and livelihoods. [applause]\nI want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving and the successful. We're not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past, we can't go back to the old policies that failed us before, nor can we just replay the successes.\nToday is not 1993. It's not 2009. So we need solutions for the big challenges we face now.\nSo today, I'm proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking Americans, an agenda for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth.\nLet me begin with strong growth. More growth means more jobs and more new businesses. More jobs give people choices about where to work.\nAnd employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones. That's why economists tell us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes.\nSmall businesses create more than 60 percent of new American jobs on net, so they have to be a top priority. I've said I want to be the small-business president, and I mean it. And throughout this campaign, I'm going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape, easier access to capital, tax relief and simplification.\nI'll also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in America, closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas. [applause]\nAnd I know it's not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform. [applause]\nI want you to hear this. Bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years. [applause]\nThen there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs, create the next generation of high-paying jobs.\nYou know, when we get Americans moving, we get our country moving. So let's establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private funds... [applause] ... channel those funds to finance world-class airports, railways, roads, bridges and ports. [applause]\nAnd let's built those faster broadband networks and make sure there's a greater diversity of providers so consumers have more choice. [applause]\nAnd really, there's no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner renewable energy right now. [applause]\nOur economy obviously runs on energy, and the time has come to make America the clean-energy superpower.\u00a0 I advocate that because these investments will create millions of jobs, save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats of climate change.\nAnd let's fund the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries, just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the 1990s and President Obama's initiatives on precision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years.\nI will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead.\nBut today, let me emphasize another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued: breaking down barriers so more Americans participate more fully in the workforce, especially women. [applause]\nWe are in a global competition, as I'm sure you have noticed. And we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines. But that's exactly what we're doing today. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.\nThe movement of women into the American workforce over the past 40 years was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But that progress has stalled.\nThe United States used to rank 7th out of 24 advanced countries in women's labor force participation. By 2013, we had dropped to 19th. That represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and for American families.\nStudies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because they're expanding family-friendly policies like paid leave and we are not.\nWe should be making it easier for Americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers. Women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying every day about how they're going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick.\nYou know, last year\u2014 [applause] \u2014last year while I was at the hospital here in Manhattan, waiting for little Charlotte to make her grand entrance, one of the nurses said, thank you for fighting for paid leave. And we began to talk about it. She sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of.\nIt's time to recognize that quality, affordable childcare is not a luxury. It's a growth strategy. And it's way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job and women of color making even less. [applause]\nYou know, all this lost money adds up. And for some women, it's thousands of dollars every year. Now I am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women's issues. Well, those days are over. [applause]\nFair pay and fair scheduling, paid family leave and earned sick days, childcare are essential to our competitiveness and our growth. And we can do this in a way that doesn't impose unfair burdens on businesses, especially small businesses.\u00a0 As president, I'll fight to put families first, just like I have my entire career. [applause]\nNow beyond strong growth, we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver of raising incomes.\u00a0 The evidence is in. Inequality is a drag on our entire economy. So this is the problem we need to tackle. Now, you may have heard Governor Bush say Americans just need to work longer hours. Well, he must not have met very many American workers. [applause]\nLet him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day, or the teacher who in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast worker marching in the streets for better pay. They do not need a lecture. They need a raise. [applause]\nThe truth is the current rules for our economy do reward some work, like financial trading, for example much more than other work, like actually building and selling things, the work that has always been the backbone of our economy. To get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. If you work hard, you ought to be a fairly. So, we do have to raise the minimum wage, and implement President Obama's new rules on overtime, and then we have to go further. [applause]\nI will crack down on bosses who exploit employees by mis-classifying them as contractors or even steal their wages. To make paychecks stretch, we need to take on the major strains on family budgets. I will protect the Affordable Care Act and build on it to lower out-of-pocket health care costs. [applause]\nAnd to make prescription drugs more affordable. We will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing Social Security and making it easier to save for the future. Now, many of these proposals are time-tested and more than a little battle scarred. We need new ideas, as well, and one I believe in and will fight for is profit-sharing. Hard-working Americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce.\nSo, I will produce ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. That is good for workers and good businesses. Studies show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in the company's success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees' pockets. It's a win-win. Later this week in New Hampshire, I will have more to say about how we do this.\nAnother priority must be reforming our tax code. Now, we hear Republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. But take a good look at their plans. Senator Rubio's would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family.\nWell, that is a sure budget busting giveaway to the super wealthy, and that's the kind of bad economics you are likely to hear from any of the candidates on the other side. I have a different take... [applause] ... guided license principles. First, hard-working families need and deserve tax relief and simplification. Second, those at the top have to pay their fair share. That's why I support the Buffet Rule, which makes sure millionaires do not pay lower rates than their secretaries. I have called for closing the carried interest loophole, that lets wealthy financiers pay an artificially low rate.\nAnd let's agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything that America has to offer, should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share, especially while companies who can't afford high-priced lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more. [applause]\nAlongside tax reform, it's time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power, which has been proven again and again to drive up wages. Republican governors like Scott Walker have made their names stomping on workers' rights, and practically all the Republican candidates hope to do the same as president. I will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks. Evidence\u2014 [applause] \u2014evidence shows that the decline of unions may be responsible for a third of the increase of inequality among men, so if we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers. [applause]\nAnd let me just say a word here about trade. The Greek crisis as well as the Chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth an ocean away are linked in a common global economy. Trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades, but it has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hard-working communities.\nSo we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements. We should support them if they create jobs, raise wages and advance our national security. And we should be prepared to walk away if they don't. To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans.\nI love the saying by Abraham Lincoln who, in many ways, was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance of the middle class and the importance of government playing its role in providing opportunities. He talked about giving Americans a fair chance in the race of life. I believe that with all my heart, but I also believe it has to start really early, at birth.\nHigh quality early learning, especially in the first five years, can set children on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by 25 percent. And\u2014 [applause] \u2014and I'm committed to seeing every 4-year-old in America have access to high quality pre-school in the next 10 years. But I want to do more. I want to call for a great outpouring of support from our faith community, our business community, our academic institutions, from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens, to really help parents, particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles, to really help prepare their own children in that 0 to 4 age group.\nEighty percent of your brain is physically formed by the age of 3. That's why families like mine read, talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter. I've said that her first words are going to be enough with the reading and the talking and the singing. [laughter]\nBut we do it not only because we love doing it, even though, I'll admit, it's embarrassing, you know, reading a book to a two-week-old or a six-week-old or a 10-week-old, but we do it because we understand it's building her capacity for learning. And the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten, she will have heard 30 million more words than a child from a less advantaged background.\nThink of what we are losing because we're not doing everything we can to reach out to those families, and we know, again, from so much research here in the United States and around the world that that early help, that mentoring, that intervention to help those often stressed-out young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid the difficulties that stand in the way of their being able to really get their child off to the best possible start.\nWe also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level, and in the coming weeks and months, I will lay out specific steps to improve our schools, make college truly affordable and help Americans refinance their student debt.\nAnd let's embrace\u2014 [applause] \u2014let's embrace the idea of lifelong learning. In an age of technological change, we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs.\nThere are exciting efforts underway and I want to support and scale the ones that show results.\nAs we pursue all these policies, we cant forget our fellow Americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world from the inner cities to coal country to Indian country.\nTalent is universal; you find it everywhere. But opportunity is not. There are nearly 6 million young people aged 16 to 24 in America today who are not in school or at work. The numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering.\nA quarter of young black men and nearly 15 percent of all Latino youth cannot find a job. We've got to do a better way of coming up to match the growing middle class incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class.\nI firmly believe that the best anti-poverty program is a job but that's hard to say if there aren't enough jobs for people that were trying to help lift themselves out of poverty.\nThat's why Ive called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas. When\u2014 [applause] \u2014when all Americans have the chance to study hard, work hard and share in our country's prosperity, that's fair growth. It's what I've always believed in and it's what I will fight for as president.\nNow the third key driver of income, alongside strong growth and fair growth, must be long-term growth. Too many pressures in our economy push us toward short-termism. Many business leaders see this. They've talked to me about it.\nOne has called it the problem of quarterly capitalism. They say everything is focused on the next earnings report or the short-term share price and the result is too little attention on the sources of long-term growth: research and development, physical capital and talent.\nNet business investment, which includes things like factories, machines and research labs, have declined as a share of the economy.\nIn recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends. That doesn't leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a company's future success.\nThese trends need to change. And I believe many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities, not just to today's share price but also to workers, communities and ultimately to our country and, indeed, our planet.\nNow I'm not talking about charity; I'm talking about clear-eyed capitalism. Many companies have prospered by improving wages and training their workers that then yield higher productivity, better service and larger profits.\nNow it's easy to try to cut costs by holding down or even decreasing pay and other investments to inflate quarterly stock prices but I would argue that's bad for business in the long run and it's really bad for our country.\nWorkers are assets. Investing in them pays off; higher wages pay off. Training pays off. To help more companies do that, I proposed a $1,500 tax credit for every worker they train and hire.\u00a0 And I will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longer-term investments that create jobs, more than just quick trades. [applause]\nI will also propose reforms to help CEOs and shareholders alike to focus on the next decade rather than just the next day. [applause]\nMaking sure stock buybacks aren't being used only for an immediate boost in share prices; empowering outside investors who want to build companies, but discouraging cut and run shareholders who act more like old-school corporate raiders. And nowhere will the shift from short-term to long-term be more important than on Wall Street.\nAs a former senator from New York, I know firsthand the role that Wall Street can and should play in our economy, helping main street grow and prosper, and boosting new companies that make America more competitive globally.\nBut as we all know in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either could not or would not keep up. I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight.\nUnder President Obama's leadership we have imposed tough new rules that deal with some of the challenges on Wall Street. Those rules have been under assault by Republicans in Congress and those running for president. I will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms we have made. We can do that, and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust.\nWe also have to go beyond Dodd-Frank. Too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky. And the problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines. Serious risks are emerging from institutions in the so-called shadow banking system, including hedge funds, high-frequency traders, non-bank finance companies. So many new kinds of entities, which receive little oversight at all.\nStories of misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking. HSBC allowing drug cartels to launder money, five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates. There can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior. [applause]\nAnd while institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all, even when they have already pocketed the gains. This is wrong, and on my watch it will change. Over the course... [applause] ... over the course of this campaign, I will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors, not just high-frequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections. I will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem. We will ensure... [applause]\nWe will ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee. And we will also process individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing. [applause]\nWhen the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public, it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public. It could, for example, help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers.\nNow, reform is never easy, but we've done it before in our country, and we have to get it right this time.\u00a0 And yes, we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us.\nTwo years ago, the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Terry Duffy, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that really caught my attention.\nHe wrote, and I quote, \"I'm concerned that those of us in financial services have forgotten who they serve and that the public knows it. Some Wall Streeters can too easily slip into regarding their work as a kind of moneymaking game divorced from concerns of the Main Street,\" unquote.\nI think we should listen to Terry Duffy. Of course, long-term growth is only possible if the public sector steps up as well.\nSo it's time to end the era of budget brinkmanship and stop careening from one self-inflicted crisis to another. It's time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus how we're going to tackle the big stuff together.\nHow do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys? Can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing? What are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors, like Silicon Valley?\nQuestions like these demand thoughtful and mature debate from our policymakers and government, from our leaders in the private sector, our economists, our academics, others who can come together to the table and on behalf of America perform their patriotic duty to make sure our economy keeps working and our middle class keeps growing. [applause]\nSo government has to be smarter, simpler, more focused itself on long-term investments than short-term politics and be a better partner to cities, states and the private sector. Washington has to be a better steward of America's tax dollars and Americans' trust. And please, let's get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology. [applause]\nThat's what I'll do as president. I will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality. [laughter] [applause]\nI want to have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together, and I will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable, including by continuing to restrain health care costs, which remain one of the key drivers of long-term deficits.\nI will make sure Washington learns from how well local governments, businesses and nonprofits are working together in successful cities and towns across America.\nYou know, passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress. As president, I will use the power to convene, connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually get things done, because above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country. [applause]\nI confess, maybe it's the grandmother in me, but I believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade you'll never sit, and the vision I've laid out here today for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth all working together will get incomes rising again, will help working families get ahead and stay ahead. That is the test of our time.\nAnd I'm inviting everyone to please join me to do your part. That's what great countries do. That's what our country always has done. We rise to challenges. It's not about left, right or center; it's about the future versus the past.\nI'm running for president to build an America for tomorrow, not yesterday, an America built on growth and fairness, an America where if you do your part, you will reap the rewards, where we don't leave anyone behind. [applause]\nThank you all. Thank you. I just want to leave you with one more thought. I want every child, not just the granddaughter of a former president or former secretary of state, but every child to be able to reach for her God-given potential. Please join me in that mission\u2014let's do it together.\nThank you all so much. [applause]\n","16":"\nDANA BASH: Hillary Clinton is campaigning across the country, but she's dropping in this week on some folks you would think she has all locked up, congressional Democrats.\nBut her lunch on Tuesday could be a little bit awkward, thanks to one man, Senator Bernie Sanders, who's been giving Clinton a run for her money on the trail with his huge crowds and his populist message.\nBut when she sat down with CNN's Brianna Keilar for her first national TV interview, Clinton insisted there's no bad blood.\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I always thought this would be a competitive race.\nSo, I am happy to have a chance to get out and run my campaign as I see fit and let other candidates do exactly the same. I feel very good about where we are in Iowa. We are signing up thousands of volunteers, people committed to caucus for us. We have a committed supporter in every one of the 1,600 precincts.\nAnd one of the things that I learned last time is, it's organize, organize, organize. So I couldn't be happier about my campaign.\nKEILAR: Senator Sanders has talked about how, if he's president, he would raise taxes. In fact, he said to CNN's Jake Tapper, he would raise them substantially higher than they are today, on big corporations, on wealthy Americans.\nWould you?\nCLINTON: Well, I will be laying out my own economic policies. Again, everybody has to run his or her own campaign. And I'm going to be telling the American people what I propose and how I think it will work. And then we'll let voters make up their minds.\nKEILAR: Are\u2014is raising taxes on the table?\nCLINTON: I'm going to put out my policies, and I'll other people speak to their policies, because I think we have to both grow the economy faster and fairer, so we have to do what will actually work in the short term, the medium term and the long term.\nI will be making a speech about my economic proposals on Monday. And then I look forward to the debate about them.\nKEILAR: We see in our recent poll that nearly six in 10 Americans say they don't believe that you're honest and trustworthy. Do you see any role that you've had in the sentiment that we've seen, where people are questioning whether you're trustworthy?\nCLINTON: I can only tell you, Brianna, that this has been a theme that has been used against me and my husband for many, many years. And, at the end of the day, I think voters sort it all out. I have great confidence. I trust the American voter.\nKEILAR: One of the issues that has eroded some trust that we've seen is the issue of your e-mail practices while you were secretary of state. I think there's a lot of people who don't understand what your thought process was on that.\nSo, can you tell me the story of how you decided to delete 33,000 e-mails and how that deletion was executed?\nCLINTON: Well, let's start from the beginning. Everything I did was permitted. There was no law, there was no regulation, there was nothing that did not give me the full authority to decide how I was going to communicate.\nPrevious secretaries of state have said they did the same thing. And people across the government knew that I used one device. Maybe it was because I am not the most technically capable person and wanted to make it as easy as possible.\nKEILAR: But you said they\u2014that they did the same thing, that they used a personal server and...\nCLINTON: Well, personal e-mail.\nKEILAR: ... when facing a subpoena, deleted e-mails from them?\nCLINTON: You know, you're starting with so many assumptions that are\u2014I've never had a subpoena. There is nothing\u2014again, let's take a deep breath here. Everything I did was permitted by law and regulation. I had one device.\nWhen I mailed anybody in the government, it would go into the government system. Now, I didn't have to turn over anything. I chose to turn over 55,000 pages, because I wanted to go above and beyond what was expected of me, because I knew the vast majority of everything that was official already was in the State Department system.\nKEILAR: Let's talk now about Republicans. There are so many. [laughter]\nBut, right now, the front-runner... [laughter]\nCLINTON: It's a big crew.\nKEILAR: It is a big crew.\nRight now, the front-runner is Jeb Bush. Can you believe that a quarter-century after your husband was elected, there could be another Bush-Clinton race?\nCLINTON: Well, we'll see.\nThat's up to, first, the Republicans on his side and the Democrats on my side. What's great about America is anybody can run for president. That is literally true. And you have to go out and you have to do what everybody else does. You have to make your case. You have to have your agenda. You have to raise the money. You have to work really hard.\nKEILAR: Donald Trump is also creating quite a lot of commotion on the other side. He's a friend of yours, has been over the years. He donated to your Senate campaign, to the Clinton Foundation.\nWhat's your reaction to his recent comments that some Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals?\nCLINTON: I'm very disappointed in those comments.\nAnd I\u2014I feel very bad and very disappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding immediately and saying: Enough. Stop it. But they are all in the\u2014you know, in the same general area on immigration.\nYou know, they don't want to provide a path to citizenship. They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants.\nKEILAR: But what about Jeb Bush's approach to that? It's different, certainly, than Donald Trump's and...\n[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: Well, he doesn't\u2014he doesn't believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does.\nKEILAR: Have you given any thought to the woman who should be on the $10 bill? [laughter]\nCLINTON: You know, I am very torn about it. I want a woman on a bill. I don't know why they picked the $10 bill. Some people are now agitating for the $20 bill.\nKEILAR: The $20. Do you think it should be the $20?\nCLINTON: You know, I want a woman on the bill. And I think that it might be easier to change the $20 than it is to change the $10. But we'll see.\nAnd I don't like the idea that, as a compromise, you would basically have two people on the same bill. One would be a woman. That sounds pretty second-class to me. So, I think a woman should have her own bill. And it may be more\u2014more appropriate to look at the $20 than the $10. I don't know. We'll see.\nKEILAR: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much for talking with us.\nCLINTON: Thank you. My pleasure. Thanks.\n","17":"\nTrump: Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.\nSo nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this.\nAnd, I can tell you, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. [laughter]\nThey didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. [applause]\nOur country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. [applause]\nAudience Member: We want Trump. We want Trump.\nTrump: When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time.\nWhen do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.\nThe U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. [applause]\nThank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\nBut I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people.\nIt's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably \u2014 probably \u2014 from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast. [applause]\nTrump: Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them.\nThey just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.\nSo now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19 \u2014 and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said \u2014 and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, \"Don't hit Iraq,\" because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.\nWe spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love \u2014 they're great \u2014 all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.\nAnd we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.\nLast week, I read 2,300 Humvees \u2014 these are big vehicles \u2014 were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.\nAudience Member: We need Trump now.\nTrump: You're right. [applause]\nAudience Member: We need Trump now.\nTrump: Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product \u2014 a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero.\nOur labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.\nAnd our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it.\nThat's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.\nBut the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.\nAudience Member: We want Trump now.\nTrump: Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.\nIt came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, \"That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing.\"\nAudience Member: We need Trump now. [applause]\nTrump: We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.\nYesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster.\nTrump: And remember the $5 billion Web site? $5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion Web site.\nI have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a Web site. It costs me $3. $5 billion Web site. [applause]\nAudience: We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump.\nTrump: Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us \u2014 believe me \u2014 to the promised land. They will not.\nAs an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know \u2014 \"Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?\"\nI like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us.\nBut you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.\nAudience Member: No more free [inaudible].\nTrump: Thank you.\nI watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, \"What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job.\"\nAnd that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to \u2014 I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine. [applause]\nIn fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing. [laughter]\nBut Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, \"Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.\"\nWe have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be \u2014 and \u2014 and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it. [applause]\nAudience: Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.\nTrump: So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully \u2014 they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.\nYes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? It won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.\nAudience: It needs Trump.\nTrump: Now, our country needs \u2014 our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote \"The Art of the Deal.\"\nAudience Member: Yes.\nTrump: We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned. [applause]\nAnd we also need a cheerleader.\nYou know, when President Obama was elected, I said, \"Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit.\"\nHe was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.\nAudience Member: But not a leader.\nTrump: He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that.\nBut he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.\nWe need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again. [applause]\nWe need \u2014 we need somebody \u2014 we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that. [applause]\nAnd, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, \"Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough.\"\nYou know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.\nSo ladies and gentlemen... [applause]\nI am officially running...[applause]... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again. [applause]\nIt can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.\nWe have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be \u2014 they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen. [applause]\nI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. [applause]\nI'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.\nRight now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.\nHow stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they? [applause]\nI'm going to tell you \u2014 thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.\nNumber one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator.\nHe's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.\nWe get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have.\nTake a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But...\nAudience Member: Yes, we do. Yes, we do. [applause]\nTrump: So we need people \u2014 I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.\nFree trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work.\nSo, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.\nBut with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything \u2014 everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete.\nSo I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, \"What's your problem?\"\nHe said, \"You know, I make great product.\"\nAnd I said, \"I know. I know that because I buy the product.\"\nHe said, \"I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.\"\nI said, \"Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this?\"\nHe said, \"Yeah, they do it all the time with other people.\"\nI said, \"They send it back?\"\n\"Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them.\"\nNow, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.\nAsk Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.\nHey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for \u2014 I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.\nI love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, \"Oh, you don't like China?\"\nNo, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much \u2014 it's like \u2014 it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.\nThey are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place.\nWe have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.\nNow they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country \u2014 we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.\nThey're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.\nAnd, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.\nSo this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, \"That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it.\"\nBut I have another one, Ford.\nSo Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.\nAll of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.\nNow, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.\nSo I announced that I'm running for president. I would... [applause]\n... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in \u2014 and I wouldn't even use \u2014 you know, I have \u2014 I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.\nYou get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph). But they're not good.\nBut I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.\nBut I wouldn't even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I'd say, \"Congratulations. I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.\"\nAnd you say to yourself, \"How does that help us,\" right? \"How does that help us? Where is that good\"? It's not.\nSo I would say, \"Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.\nNow, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're [inaudible]. And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, \"You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford.\"\nAnd guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us.\nSo under President Trump, here's what would happen: [applause]\nThe head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.\nAnd he'll say, \"Please, please, please.\" He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, \"No interest.\" Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, \"Sorry, fellas. No interest,\" because I don't need anybody's money. It's nice. I don't need anybody's money.\nI'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I [inaudible]...[applause]\nAnd by the way, I'm not even saying that in a \u2014 that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.\nAudience Member: Absolutely.\nTrump: So \u2014 because we got to make the country rich.\nIt sounds crass. Somebody said, \"Oh, that's crass.\" It's not crass.\nWe got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.\nWe got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.\nWe've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it. [applause]\nBut here's what's going to happen:\nAfter I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the \u2014 the donors and by the lobbyists \u2014 and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero \u2014 I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. \"Please reconsider,\" I'll say no.\nHe'll say, \"Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico.\" That's it. They have no choice. They have no choice.\nThere are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example.\nTrump: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say \"we're gonna protect.\" What are we doing? They've got nothing but money.\nIf the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us.\nAnd believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out \u2014 and they kept our equipment.\nThey always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be \u2014 we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.\nBut look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone.\nAnd I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now \u2014 it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running. [applause]\nBut all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, \"Is he intelligent?\"\nThen I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question.\nHow are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna \u2014 how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible.\nBut Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.\nThere is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.\nSo Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.\nAudience Member: Yes.\nTrump: Somebody said \u2014 thank you, darlin'. [applause]\nSomebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, \"But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.\"\nAudience Member: We don't need nice.\nTrump: That's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family. [applause]\nBy the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job? [applause]\nGreat. Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family. They're a great family. [applause]\nSo the reporter said to me the other day, \"But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?\"\nI said, \"I don't know.\" I said, \"I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person.\"\nBut, I said, \"This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, \"He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle.\"\nTrump: They're right about that, but I'm doing it.\nNumber two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.\nSo I said, \"That's OK.\" I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job.\nI started off \u2014 thank you \u2014 I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said \u2014 and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.\nBut he used to say, \"Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it.\"\nI said, \"I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it.\"\nAnd after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals \u2014 the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.\nBut they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, \"Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks.\"\nSo I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am. [applause]\nI've employed \u2014 I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.\nSo a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything. [applause]\nAnd it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, \"He had assets of $9 billion.\" So I said (ph), \"No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets.\"\nSo they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate.\nIt's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.\nAnd I have assets \u2014 big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected \u2014 9 billion 240 million dollars.\nAudience Member: Yeah.\nTrump: And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph). That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.\nIn fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, \"Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion\"? I said, \"I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it.\"\nBut in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of \u2014 net worth, not assets, not \u2014 a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets \u2014 Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York \u2014 many other places all over the world.\nSo the total is $8,737,540,00.\nNow I'm not doing that... [applause]\nI'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not.\nI'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.\nWe have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.\nSo I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years \u2014 you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.\nAccording to the economists \u2014 who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying \u2014 that $24 trillion \u2014 we're very close \u2014 that's the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That's when we become Greece. That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable. And we're gonna be there very soon. We're gonna be there very soon.\nAudience Member: Make America strong.\nTrump: So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.\nAudience Member: Yeah. [applause]\nI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\nAudience Member: Yes.\nTrump: Mark my words. [applause]\nNobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. [applause]\nI will find \u2014 within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.\nAudience Member: Yes. [applause]\nTrump: I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. [applause]\nI will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately. [applause]\nFully support and back up the Second Amendment. [applause]\nNow, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, \"You know, Mr. Trump,\" and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, \"You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened\" \u2014 it's up in the prison area \u2014 \"my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting.\"\nI said, \"Very interesting.\"\nSo protect the Second Amendment. [applause]\nEnd \u2014 end Common Core. Common Core should \u2014 it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end \u2014 education has to be local.\nRebuild the country's infrastructure.\nAudience Member: Yeah.\nTrump: Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.\nI look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.\nYou know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after \u2014 or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.\nWell, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.\nTrump: So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.\nYou look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.\nSave Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. [applause]\nGet rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.\nRenegotiate our foreign trade deals.\nAudience Member: Yes. [applause]\nTrump: Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.\nBe careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.\nAnd strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.\nAudience Member: Yes. [applause]\nTrump: Sadly, the American dream is dead.\nAudience Member: Bring it back.\nTrump: But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.\nThank you. Thank you very much. [applause]\n","18":"\nCLINTON: Thank you so much. [applause]\nThank you. Oh, I am thrilled to be here, and to be in such a beautiful facility, having just had the chance to spend a little time with some children, mostly 4-year-olds, but a few 5-year-olds. It was great.\nAnd I thank Julie and the entire team here at the Y. I am such a big believer in this kind of partnership, and I was thrilled, as Julie was talking about it, to see the applause break out on behalf of this YMCA and all that it does.\nThis is, for me, a very important place to be to talk about a really critical issue, one that, as Julie has said, I have spent much of my adult life being committed to and concerned about, and I can't think of a better place to do this than here in New Hampshire, a state that will always have a special place in my heart. [laughter] [applause]\nAnd so, I had a great event Saturday in a perfect place on a perfect day, on Roosevelt Island in New York City at the Four Freedoms park that was constructed in honor of President Roosevelt. And I was able to talk about the four fights that I want to wage and win on behalf of the American people.\nThey, to me, really encapsulate what my campaign is about, but also what our country needs to do together, build an economy for tomorrow, not yesterday; strengthen America's families, because when our families are strong, America is strong; harness all of our power, not just the military but diplomatic and economic to use our values to lead the world; and to revitalize our democracy here at home, particularly by focusing on getting dark, unaccountable money out of politics, even if it takes a constitutional amendment. [applause]\nAnd I will be rolling out specific policies over the weeks to come, but I do believe with all my heart that everything we need to do in our country really starts with how we treat our children and how we try to raise them, taking care of their needs, being able to stimulate them, to give them a better chance in life, helping them become successful and good citizens.\nAnd, for me, all of this does come back to our kids. And that's because my mother, who was with me in New Hampshire in 2008, really taught me that everybody needs a chance and everybody needs a champion. And for... [applause]\nFor her, she knew what it was like not to have either when she was growing up, because she was abandoned very young by her parents and sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her, so that by the time she was 14, she was out on her own, working as a house maid and a babysitter, in another family's home.\nAnd I didn't know any of this when I was growing up. When I was the age of the kids we were reading \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\" to, I just knew she was my mom. And she was great and she was fun, and she taught me so much. And she made grilled cheese and tomato soup sandwiches. I mean, there was just a wonderful sense of being loved and taken care of, but also being inspired.\nAnd I remember asking her when I got old enough to kind of piece together some of the answers to questions I was getting about her childhood, how could she do this?\nAnd her answer was very simple, you know, kindness along the way from people that cared about her and showed her she mattered. The first-grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat for lunch, and without embarrassing here, started bringing extra food, and then would lean over and whisper, \"Dorothy, I brought too much food today. Would you like some? I can't eat it all.\"\nOr even the woman whose house she went to work in, she wanted so much to go to high school, but she knew she had to do the chores that were necessary. And so the woman said, \"Well, if you can get your chores done, you can go to high school.\" And that was a great gift that my mother was forever grateful for.\nBecause those people believed in her, she believed in me. You know, there is a direct link. If we believe in our children, we instill in them the belief that they are worth something. And then they, in turn, can pass that on.\nNow, ideally we all hope that families can do that. But in today's world, it's really hard for many families to do everything they're expected to do under the stresses that they face. Because of her, I believe in the potential of every American, and particularly every American child. And when our children succeed, America succeeds.\nSo, I've been a champion for early childhood education for as long as I can remember, really starting when I was in law school and got interested in, as I was studying the law, why do some people follow the law and other people don't. What's\u2014what's in their background? What makes them either a productive member of society or somebody on the outside who may be trying to tear down instead of build up?\nAnd that's why I'm putting this front and center in my campaign, because I think it's time we realized once and for all that investing in our children is one of the best investments our country can make. [applause]\nNow, I think most of us kind of intuitively have known that. But now research is telling us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact life-long success. So we have to help parents be their children's first teachers, from that very first day. And we have to help them get access to quality, affordable childcare and preschool.\nAnd for me, it's recognizing the reality of today's families: 40 percent of the breadwinners, the principle breadwinners in America today are women. We have a lot of single moms heroically trying to raise kids under sometimes very challenging circumstances. We have a lot of two-parent families where people are working night shifts. They're overlapping. They are just doing everything they can sometimes with multiple jobs to keep body and soul together and put that food on the table and that roof over their head.\nToday's parents have to juggle so much. They have to squeeze every minute out of every 24-hour day. And that just makes the argument even stronger as to why we have to have their backs. We have to be there to help them do the best job they can possibly do.\nYes, they need to do the job that pays them. But at the end of the day, the job raising children, taking care of your family, caring even for your parents as they age, is the most important job any of us will ever do. And we don't do it for pay. We do it for love. We do it for a sense of giving back. But let's try to figure out how to make it a little bit easier.\nYou know, I met a woman... [applause]\nYou know, I met a woman a few weeks\u2014a couple weeks ago who was trying to do everything she could imagine to make it work. She was a single mom. She's raising three kids. She was working, and she was going to community college, because she was trying to get ahead so that she could get a better job.\nShe said, \"You know, I don't ask for anything, but why does it have to be so hard\"? I hear that question all over. \"Why does it have to be so hard\"?\nIt's hard enough to pay for any preschool or childcare at all, let alone the quality programs that help kids develop and flourish. Funding for these opportunities has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. So it's no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent the past decade.\nIn many states, it costs more for childcare of quality than it costs for college tuition, and we know what's happened at that end of the learning curve.\nWe actually did make a lot of progress expanding preschool attendance for 3-and 4-year-olds during the 1990s. I was honored to hold the first ever White House conference on early childhood development to bring together people, like those you see here. [applause]\nBut starting in 2001, there's been almost no progress. Only 55 percent of all of America's 3-and 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool, and meanwhile, many of our economic competitors are racing ahead. They are making big investments in preschool and early education.\nI'll tell you a little story. You know, I spent a lot of time as secretary of state trying to figure out how we were going to deal with the rise of China. It's going to be one of the biggest problems for the next president. And there're a lot of aspects to it.\nBut I was not surprised to get a call about two years ago shortly, after I left the State Department, on behalf of the highest-ranking woman in the Chinese government. And she was coming to Washington, and I had worked with her as secretary of state, and she asked if she could see me, and I said, \"Of course. I'd be happy to see her.\"\nAnd then she said, \"You know, could you do an event with me about early childhood\"? I said, \"Oh, certainly. What is it about early childhood that has you so interested\"?\nHere's what she said, and then we did the event. We did the event at the Brookings Institute in Washington.\nChina's making a huge commitment to early childhood and to pre-kindergarten. Why? They look at the same brain research.\nIn fact, they have asked the American Nobel Prize-winning economist from the University of Chicago, hardly a hotbed of radical liberalism... [laughter] ... to be their consultant, among others, because he did the study, which proved that early-childhood investing by a country is one of the best returns on investment that we can make. So the Chinese are using an American expert for that. [applause]\nThough, if I hadn't been excited before, I got really motivated about this. But unfortunately, we're hearing something different from Republican leaders in Washington.\nRepublicans aren't just missing the boat on early-childhood education; they're trying to sink it. Their budget puts at risk on the most effective investments for our youngest children, Early Head Start.\nDid they cut subsidies to oil companies? No. Did they cut tax loopholes, like carried interest for hedge-fund managers? No.\nThe Republicans took care of those at the top and went after the kids.\nNow I believe getting off to a good start should be our children's birthright, part of the basic bargain that we have with each other as a nation.\nEvery child should have the tools and the skills to thrive in tomorrow's economy, especially those kids from our most vulnerable and at-risk communities. And we need to make sure that parents can get good jobs and stay in the workforce. That drives the economic engine. So we have to do more to help them deal with the most difficult of the decisions of parents for young children to stay in the workforce.\nI believe the time has come to make pre-school and quality child care available to every child in America. If our families are going to be strong and our economy is going to thrive, all our kids need the chance to get off to the best possible start. [applause]\nI will I will work with states and communities across America to make sure that in the next 10 years, every four-year-old in America has access to high-quality pre-school. Now already governors and state legislatures across the country are discovering the value of pre-school and this is bipartisan.\nYou know, one of the states with a universal pre-K program in America is Oklahoma\u2014about as red a state as you can get. But they have figured it out, the government and business leaders and families alike that this is a smart investment for them. And we have to build on the momentum started by the states. Now look how far here in New Hampshire you've come.\nNearly 20 years ago, back when Senator Jeanne Shaheen was Governor Shaheen, she delivered funding for public kindergarten for the first time in the state's history. [applause]\nThat then allowed the conversation to move where it is today with Governor Maggie Hassan supporting efforts for full-day kindergarten and innovative pre-K partnerships. So you start and get what you... [applause] ... have achieved on kindergarten. Then you move toward full day and then innovative pre-K.\nAll across the country we need to be doing that. And we also need to invest in child care because, if you only start at four, the brain research shows that 80 percent of your brain has developed by the age of three. Now the good news is that leaves 20 percent to keep working on. [laughter]\nBut it is a fact that, by three, many of our kids have already had most of the brain development that they're going to get. And in this campaign, I'll offer a comprehensive agenda to ensure that every child in America has access to quality affordable child care. [applause]\nI will propose a middle-class tax cut to help parents deal with rising child care costs. [applause]\nAnd I'll lead an effort to expand child care opportunities and to make sure that programs address both the needs of working parents and the needs of children.\nWe shouldn't think of child care as just a place to deposit your kids, a warehouse. We should invest in programs that create health environments for early learning and to make sure that parents get the support they need from the time their children are infants. I will double the Early Head Start Child Care Partnership Grant Program, which brings Head Start's evidenced-based curriculum into the child care setting to provide comprehensive, full-day, high-quality services to low-income families. And I will double our investment in Early Head Start itself, a program I helped to create when I was first lady. And we know... [applause]\nWe know it's making a difference, because we actually have evidence that shows it's making a difference.\nAnd this is part, as I said, of a long-term commitment of mine, going back to my Methodist Church, where I was\u2014I was raised, and babysitting, you know, children of Mexican migrant farmworkers, through my years at the Children's Defense Fund, working to expand opportunities for kids with disabilities, and through my time in the White House with my husband and in the Senate in New York and even as secretary of state, because I have learned that talent is universal, but opportunity is not. And I look sometimes... [applause]\nI look sometimes in the eyes of kids who've had a really tough set of obstacles to overcome, and they're doing the best they can. And we need to do what we can to help them succeed.\nBut every baby comes into this world with so much God-given potential. And when they leave the hospital, some will have great opportunity their family can give them, and others will struggle.\nNow, as you may have heard, I am a new grandmother. And so, for me... [applause] ... this has become really personal. I remember being in the hospital waiting for Charlotte's arrival and talking to the nurses there. And what did they want to talk to me about? They wanted to talk to me about how hard it was for them, plus a lot of their patients, to get childcare. How it was especially hard when they had to work the night shift. How they has to keep juggling everything, all the time. And it was here, at one of the great moments in my life, a reminder that there are so many hardworking, conscientious people, who deserve more help than they're getting right now.\nAnd it needs to be a partnership, just like this Y is a partnership. You know, a partnership between the public and private interests. A partnership where people feel that they can contribute and participate.\nI think if we come together and take this on as a true national mission, we can unlock the potential of all our children and further the potential of our country.\nAnd our country then will be more inclusive, not leaving people behind and out, and where a father can tell his daughter, \"You can grow up to be anything you want, including president of the United States.\" [applause]\nQUESTION: Well, how do you do? How do you do?\nI'm Jackie Cowell , and like many of you I'm looking around the audience and I'm seeing many of you that like me have been working on this for 20 or 30 years. So thank you for your perseverance on early childhood education out there, you know.\nAnd the children that you met this morning are likely to graduate from high school in 2030. So just think about what 2030 is going to be looking like.\nWhen I was in high school, our class took a field trip to see a computer. I don't... [laughter] ... I don't think they do that anymore, but... [laughter] ... but it's really going to be\u2014they're likely to retire in the 2080s. So how do you prepare them for this very complex world they're going to inherit? And many of them will hold jobs that haven't been invented yet. So it's really working on these skills, as you talked about\u2014early childhood education. And we're thrilled that this discourse is now part of the presidential primary; that early childhood education is being talked about; and making sure ever child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.\nAnd, you know, here in New Hampshire, things have been tough for families, trying to make ends meet, trying to make sure they can get into childcare that is quality, that really helps them reach their full potential. And there's too many families that aren't able to do that because of the difference of the cost.\nSo, yeah.\nCLINTON: Well, you know, Jackie , I think that's a great perspective to put on it because when we talk about early childhood, we think about the little kids like the ones that we were with in the classroom.\nBut we ought to have a broader perspective and think about the adults they will become. And what kind of adults do we need? We need people who will have exactly the skills for jobs that haven't been invented, and will have the temperament and the character and the attributes to, you know, get along with people, to respect the law, respect each other, to be part of building a stronger, more prosperous America.\nAnd I think it's a great perspective if you kind of work backwards and you say to yourself, \"OK, what are you going to look for in somebody who wants to be a worker and a citizen in 15, 20, 30 years?\" You know that that really starts so importantly at the beginning.\nQUESTION: Thank you so much for being here this morning and for this discussion.\nI'm Mary Lou Beaver from Rochester. I'm not here this morning representing an organization, but as someone who was in the field for more than 25 years as a teacher, as a center director, and as a center owner here in Rochester.\nI also was a mom, who was dependent upon childcare for my children as I suddenly found myself a single mom, and was in school trying to continue my education so that I could do more and provide more for my family. Having quality childcare education, early education for my kids was so important to me because I was in and out so much of the time when I really wanted to be spending time with them, and wanted to give them all that I could.\nBut as so many parents today are facing, you need to work the hours that you have to work in order to support your family. And it's very important that we have not only the accessibility and the quality, but the affordability for all families.\nDo you agree?\nCLINTON: Oh, I do agree. And I think your story is really important for everybody to hear because that is the reality that is going on right now. I\u2014I just meet so many working parents, particularly single working moms who are struggling. They're really working as hard as they can, as you were, and many of them trying to go to school at the same time because they know they'll have a better future if they do.\nI remember when I was teaching law at the University of Arkansas, oh gosh, back in the early 1970s, I met so many people around the campus who were single parents, trying to go to school. And childcare was their biggest obstacle. And we, you know, we started a fund called the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, because it wasn't the money that they needed so much for the tuition, although that was a stretch, it was all the other expenses that surrounded the difficulty of them being able to get their education.\nAnd I think you have to look at what young families are going through today in a very comprehensive way and say, OK, what can the extended family do? What can the\u2014you know, houses of worship, our churches, do? What can communities do? What can the Y do? Or you know, the Boys & Girls Club?\nThere's so many different ways to kind of piece this together, but there isn't any way to get to a universal program, unless our government in Washington sees it as a priority to partner with many of the states and localities\u2014we have the mayor here; thank you for being here, mayor\u2014so that we can provide the backstop and the support that is necessary.\nAnd it's particularly important for the youngest kids, the zero to three kids, because those are kids who need a lot more personal attention. You know, Bill and I are exhausted every time we take care of Charlotte. [laughter]\nWe love every minute of it, but whew. It reminds you hard it is to raise babies and to keep an eye on them, as they, you know, take off on their own. So I think it is important that we do everything we can to deal with that zero-to-three age group. And that's going to take more direction. That's why I mentioned Early Head Start Child Care Partnership and the Early Head Start Program.\nBut again, we need more people to help fill that space because that's often where parents really are stretched, and we also don't have a lot of time off for a lot of working parents And so, just getting everything organized, when you have that new baby is a challenge, don't you think?\nQUESTION: Absolutely. As a grandmother, I can certainly relate to the exhaustion. [laughter] The other concern that I had as a center director was the wages that we were able to pay to our educators. We know that consistent, quality educators are so important to young children, as they are growing and learning. But we can't always keep them, because of the wages that are paid.\nCLINTON: Well, that's why I said I'm going to offer a middle-class tax cut that can go toward helping parents pay for quality child care, because you've put your finger on one the biggest problems. A lot of parents cannot afford quality child care. And a lot of the teachers and the child care workers can't afford to live on what the parents can pay.\nSo you have a perfect storm where we need quality child care, but how are we going to get the people with the continuity so that the experience is there to be able to deliver that child care. When parents can't go any further, they're stretched as far as they can get.\nAnd I have been meeting with child care workers. And a lot of them just throw up their hands. They'd rather go be a food server for the money, but not for the, you know, reward that they have gotten from taking care of kids. They just\u2014I mean, they're making $8, $9, $10 an hour for often 12-hour days. And that is just a huge burden on them and their family. So then, you have a downward spiral. Is that what you've seen, too?\nQUESTION: It is. There's a saying that: Parent's can't afford to pay; teachers can't afford to stay; there's got to be a better way. And so...\nUNKNOWN: That's good.\nQUESTION: Right\u2014it's the Worthy Wage Campaign, is\u2014that's their saying.\nAnd so here in New Hampshire, we've actually with the Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services and our governor's office applied for two federal grants, hoping to really show what we could do in early childhood education. So the Race to the Top\u2014Early Learning Challenge Grant and the Preschool Development Grant, and we didn't get them. And one of the reasons, we're the only New England state that didn't get the Race to the Top Grant, because we've been divesting instead of investing.\nAnd so what we found also, talking with business leaders, that this is not a red or a blue issue, that people really genuinely care about making sure every child has that opportunity.\nSo here in New Hampshire, we're really seeing that starting to\u2014to come\u2014but we haven't gotten those grants, and we'd like to.\nCLINTON: Well, I want to throw it open for\u2014I know there're a lot of people in this audience who care deeply about this issue, have their own experience in doing the issue.\nAnd so Julia, I think we should see if somebody else wants to contribute to the conversation.\nMODERATOR: Do we have any questions from the audience? Right here in the pattern?\nQUESTION: Hi.\nCLINTON: There is\u2014there is...\nMODERATOR: There is a microphone coming.\nCLINTON: There's a roving microphone. [laughter]\nQUESTION: Oh. Thank you.\nMy daughter\u2014my granddaughter is here. What are you going to do for the\u2014the grandparents that are raising these children? My generation, all of my friends are raising their grandchildren.\nCLINTON: Can I ask you without\u2014I don't want to impinge on your\u2014your privacy. What are the circumstances under which you're raising your grandchildren [inaudible]?\nQUESTION: It was\u2014[inaudible]\u2014they're going to be turned over to the state because of addiction.\nCLINTON: So, you know, I have to tell you, this is\u2014thank you. Thank you. I'm so, so sorry. But you are the second grandmother in New Hampshire who's said that to me.\nAnd that's one of the reasons why if you followed my campaign\u2014because of what I've been hearing, because I have spent two months listening to people, because I do think it's important, when you want to represent the entire country, you actually listen to what's happening in people's lives. And substance abuse and addiction is ravaging families all over the country.\nAnd I heard it first in Iowa and then as soon as I got to New Hampshire\u2014I was sitting down in Keene, New Hampshire talking to some people. First thing a retired doctor said, \"What are you going to do about the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire\"?\nFirst of all, I'm going to talk a lot about it, because we need to drag it out of shadows. We need to hold it up to the light. [applause]\nAnd\u2014and\u2014and then it's heartbreaking, because there has not been an event I've got to, where somebody hasn't come up to me, sometimes bravely, like you did in public, and sometimes just privately taking me aside to talk to me about it.\nThat and mental-health problems that go untreated and... [applause]\nSo I would say three things.\nFirst, I think you're very brave and very loving to take on this responsibility, and you should know that every time... [applause] ... you think about how hard it is, and you're grandchildren will be really better off because their grandmother stepped in and said, \"I'm here for you, and I will take care of you.\" [applause]\nSecondly, we have to\u2014we have to extend every program, every tax\u2014everything we do to people taking care of kids, whether they are parents or they are grandparents or maybe, in some cases, older siblings or aunts or uncles, because of the inability of a child's parents to be able to do so.\nSo whatever I propose, you will be eligible for, people who are taking care of their grandchildren. [applause]\nYes. Yes. [applause]\nRight now, you can't get any help in most places. And we have to change that. We have to face the reality. I mean, when you're\u2014look, I just --we were just laughing about, you know, my eight-month old is beginning, you know, heave herself around in the resemblance of a crawl. But once she takes off and we're chasing her around, and trying to keep her hands out of the outlets and all the things that you have to do with little kids, grandparents who are raising their kids, and there are millions of them, need more help.\nYou know, when I was a senator, I championed a program in New York City to have a special form of housing for grandmothers raising their kids, because they needed, in my view, the support of a community. Because it can be really isolating. I mean, most of your friends, you know, they're not raising babies, toddlers or school-age kids, so you need the support of a broader community to help you with that, and you need the support that any parent would get, because that's what you're doing, you're parenting.\nSo I can tell you that I will do everything I can, both in any benefit that I think the country should extend to raising children, you will be eligible, but also to the idea of how do we provide support for you and for other grandmothers, because it's predominantly grandmothers. There are some grandfathers, predominantly grandmothers too.\nQUESTION: [off-mike]\nCLINTON: It is.\nQUESTION: [off-mike]\nCLINTON: You have half-a-dozen friends?\nQUESTION: Well, yeah.\nCLINTON: No, no, I mean who are raising their children. [laughter]\nYeah.\nQUESTION: They're raising... [crosstalk]\nCLINTON: And do you support each other?\nQUESTION: Oh, absolutely.\nCLINTON: OK. That's\u2014that's important. You need to support each other because you need to get that, you know, that emotional support and the\u2014and the\u2014and the hints and the tips, like, you know, somebody finds out something that'll work for them, it may work for you.\nSo thank you for raising that and thank you for saying that. Yeah.\nJulie?\nMODERATOR: Thank you.\nNext question. Over here? Sure.\nQUESTION: Hi. Early childhood education is a great foundation, but I have a 14 year old, so what your plans for education in general? The state of education today is horrendous, especially for children with ADHD. You're looking at cookie-cutter classrooms, and these kids don't learn that way.\nSo what types of plans do you have for them?\nCLINTON: Well, this is one of the\u2014you know, the key issues about how we do more do adapt our school system to spark the ability to learn in every kind of kid, because kids learn differently.\nYou know, some kids can sit there and absorb the teacher's lessons. Some kids need to move. Some kids need to have practical experience. And I do think we have erred in trying to channel every kid into one form of learning. And I don't think that... [applause]\nI don't think that works for every kid. And especially for kids who are hyperactive, kids who, you know, need to be channeled and directed, but also need to be able to, you know, get rid of some of that extra energy that they've got.\nI mean, I don't know how you\u2014I don't know how you expect to eliminate everything from recess to gym to extracurricular activities during the school day and not have a lot of kids unable to concentrate and a lot of kids unable to really absorb the lessons you're trying to teach.\nSo, the specific issue about ADHD kids is we need to make sure we have the best possible diagnosis and treatment, because we are medicating lots of kids. And I think we have to ask ourselves: Are we medicating those kids because they have a medical condition that needs to be medicated? And the answer is yes, some do, no doubt about it. But are we medicating kids because we've not yet figured out how to better deal with their particular needs?\nAnd that starts in the family, because it, you know, it's hard for a lot of families, but it also goes into the schools.\nSo I\u2014I\u2014part of what I will be talking about in the campaign is how do we, you know, get our schools and doing so by respecting our teachers who are on the front lines of trying to... [applause] ... help kids. And, you know, trying to figure out what works for different kinds of kids. And I don't think a cookie-cutter approach works. I want every kid to do well in school. I want every kid to get the skills that that kid needs. I think we made an error when we eliminated in high school, in most high schools, technical education, what we used to call vocational education. [applause]\nI think, you know, there are\u2014we're going to need a lot of jobs that are good jobs, by people who can do work that is not just academic work. It is work that, you know, they learn to do by doing. And then\u2014I was, you know, I was in a community college, you knew, New Hampshire Technical Institute, talking to the people there. And the\u2014there were students who were taking courses, who were in high school. That's one way of doing it, having kind of a group of high schools send their kids to a technical institute if they're interested.\nI went to one in Iowa where young kids were learning how to be machinists. They were juniors and seniors in high school. And the ones who were seniors had jobs lined up, starting to pay, like, $40,000 because they were coming out as a certified machinist.\nWell, we need to make that available for more kids. And, look, I'm not a scientist. [laughter]\nBut unlike a lot of the candidates on the other side, I actually listen to scientists. [laughter]\nAnd one of the things that... [laughter and applause] ... one of the things that I will try to do, with a\u2014by partnering, you know, not by mandating and directing, but partnering with our educators, partnering with people who have experience like our folks here, is to figure out: OK, how do we get more hands-on learning? Because I do believe that for kids, especially ADHD kids, doing something, not trying to sit still, which is really hard, but getting up and learning, you know, going from machine to machine to figure out how it works, if that's their interest.\nSo we're going to take a hard look at all of that. But it's\u2014you know, education is a local and state matter, but I think if we do a better job looking at all the research about what actually produces the best results, then we can come up with some incentive programs and some encouragement that will begin to try once again to get our education system to respond to the real needs that a whole variety of kids have.\nQUESTION: Thank you. [applause]\nMODERATOR: Can we get someone in the back? Women in the [inaudible]? Yes.\nHere comes the mike.\nQUESTION: Thank you. We spend so much money on the military and we are able to get the money just like this. But nationwide, our schools are not equal and they're not of the same standards. So, why are we not making a priority nationwide and per state on education as much as spending on other things? And the military is important, I do realize that.\nOK. Thank you.\nCLINTON: Well, you know, education has been principally a state responsibility and a local responsibility. And it really wasn't until, you know, 30, 40 years ago, really, I guess back in the 1960s, when the government began to put in a lot more money from the Federal Government into education.\nAnd the original idea behind the Federal Government putting money in was to try to equalize spending, so that, you know, kids in poor districts would have a better chance to get the same resources and the same quality of teachers and all that, which I think is still very important, so that it was an equity argument\u2014some of you know, Title 1, in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\u2014was really designed to do that.\nThen in the Reagan Administration, I think it was 19\u2014I want to remember here\u2014'83 or so. There was a report that came out called \"A Nation at Risk.\" And it compared our educational outcomes with comparable countries, mostly Europeans, some Asian, and basically said, you know, our kids are not keeping up, they're not performing. And that was really a big change.\nThe Reagan administration began saying, OK, well, the Federal Government has to do more to try to change the way we're educating. And that went on. And certainly, President George W. Bush with No Child Left Behind, it was certainly well-motivated. I was in the Senate. I know the arguments that were made. And it was to try to, you know, create a system where, no matter who you were, where you went to school, you'd have the same expectations about how you were going to achieve.\nAnd I say all of this because we've always spent money on our military, you know, depending upon who's in and who's out, greater or lesser amounts. But always the biggest part of the budget, other than Social Security, Medicare, et cetera.\nSo I think that your question is a fair one, like, what are our priorities? We will always have to have the\u2014you know, the strongest, best-equipped military. But even there we have to save money. We have to be smart about it. We have to look for ways to get more done efficiently.\nAnd just like every other part of government, it needs to be looked at hard, so that we don't just send money, without getting the results that we need. And there are a lot of issues in procurement and in other areas around\u2014you know, military equipment and expenditures that really need to be cleaned up, streamlined and made less expensive without sacrificing quality.\nSo I think that it's time in our country\u2014and in my speech on Saturday, I said we have to [inaudible] our government. We have to take a hard look at everything. We have to bring it into the 21st century. Now our military equipment is 22nd century. I mean, it's more advanced than anybody, anywhere.\nBut we're also fighting wars where a lot of what we've paid a lot of money for is no longer applicable. I mean, we're dealing with different kinds of threats. We're dealing with cyber threats. We're dealing with, you know, irregular warfare and terrorism. So we've got to adjust how we fund even defense, but we have to always fund it. to the extend that we need to get the outcomes we're looking for.\nBut on education, we've put more federal dollars in. But to go back to the question about ADHD, we need to take a hard look about what's working and what's not working. I just want to give you a\u2014and I'm going to roll out a whole education proposal, too. But I want to give you a quick understanding of what I mean.\nYou know, everybody believes, and I'm guilty of this, that we're an expert about education, because we went to school. [laughter]\nAnd those of us who are parents, we had kids in school, so we think we got it all figured out. We know what worked or didn't work for us and, therefore, we kind of translate that into what will or won't work for other people.\nLook, there's a lot of truth to that. People's\u2014your experience matters. And how you experienced school matters.\nBut I think research really counts. So, there's a team of researchers I know\u2014you know, they're based at Harvard, but other schools have been involved. And they went through all of the work that's been done. They said, OK, what makes for a great school?\nAnd they came out with some things that are simple, but hard to do and hard to pay for, you know, things like a longer school year, particularly for disadvantaged kids. We have so much research, it matters, because, you know, for many of this in room, summertime, you give your kids new experiences. Maybe they go to the Y camp. I was talking to, you know, one of he people where who runs the camps. Maybe they\u2014maybe you take them on trips, where they go to museums.\nBut for a lot of kids, they actually lose learning over the summer. So here the teachers have worked and worked, and parents have reinforced the messages in many instances, then they lose ground, so they start the school year a little behind in some areas than where they ended the school year.\nSo a longer school year for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense. A longer school day for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense, because if you have kids particularly in the pre-teen, early-teen years, and they get out of school before parents get home from work, that is one of the worst times of the day for kids to get themselves in trouble. And all kinds of trouble and bad influences.\nWell, you know, the parents are working. Oftentimes, again, they have no options, so longer day, longer school day.\nMore support for preparing for teachers so that they can share what works with each other. Now, that sounds so simple, but it is so critical. Like, OK, what worked in your classroom? You know, I tried this lesson, it didn't work, let's take another look at it.\nAnd what we've done instead is to disempower experienced teachers and instead basically try to lay on top of them all of these tests and all of these standards.\nI believe in both, always have, but you can get to a point of diminishing returns. Too many and really all you're doing is like running on the hamster wheel, instead of figuring out what does this kid need? What's the diagnosis for this kid's problem? How do we deal with it? And then finally let's not forget the role that parents play and families play in helping a kid succeed in school. So having more interaction between the school and the home, even if it's a phone call, even if it's an e-mail exchange, even better if it's regular visits. Because if parents don't understand what their kids are supposed to be learning and they don't reinforce it, it's really hard for teachers to make that case.\nSo I think that we can do a better job in using the money we spend on education more effectively and trying to figure out where at state and local levels more expenditures would make a difference. And I'm very open to that because it breaks my heart that in a lot of poor districts right now, those poor schools have lost every extracurricular activity. They don't have sports teams anymore. They don't have bands. They don't have plays. They don't have a lot of the things that you remember from school and that for many kids gave them their first taste of success.\nAnd so, when you cut out all of those programs and you just say, \"You've got to do well on these tests\" that are taught in a certain way, to be learned in a certain way, a lot of kids are not gonna be able to grasp that and do well. But if you give them more options, more responsibility and more support for those places that need it, then, I think, we can get better outcomes personally as well as academically.\nSo that's what I want to see us do more of, so. [applause]\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMODERATOR: Thank you.\nWe have time for one more question. Lady in the back in the polka dot?\nQUESTION: Thank you for mentioning that you listen to scientists, because I happen to be one of them. [laughter]\nCLINTON: Excellent. [laughter]\nQUESTION: So I'm a mom, and [inaudible] that way, but also I am a research psychologist, and studying creativity and studying social-emotional learning, especially in schools.\nAnd one thing that you mentioned also was that we want to prepare kids, and I completely agree with you, for the jobs of tomorrow that we don't know what they're going to be. We don't know what they are going to be, and the central skill that we need to teach them and enable is creativity.\nHowever, we seem to also do one more thing is compare ourselves to places like China. And our education is turning into worksheet-based education. Only we are drilling kids and art is disappearing, music is disappearing, even in [inaudible] rich schools where I live in Portsmouth. Art is once a week. Music is once a week. That's it.\nAnd it's all about tests and it's all about [inaudible] even in kindergarten. I have heard stories from kindergartners who come home crying after tests in kindergarten.\nSo, can we try to compare ourselves also to places like Finland that do not start formal education until age seven? [applause]\nThey let them play. [applause]\nCLINTON: Well, you make a great point. If people are really interested in following up on the points that she made, we don't compare ourselves to China, but it is stressing to me when China invests in preschool opportunities for kids and we don't. Because if you look at the highest-performing nations, Finland is usually at the top.\nThey have early childhood education. They have paid leave. They have support for families. And yes, they don't start school until kids are seven, but those kids have not just been wandering around fending for themselves. They've been in organized settings, predominantly family-based, but not exclusively.\nAnd if you look at the other countries\u2014the best comparisons are to what are called the OECD countries, if you're interested in googling that and looking. They do a very thorough educational survey every few years and they lay out what's working and what's not working.\nAnd I absolutely agree that, you know, creativity, you cannot expect kids to be creative if you don't let them play. Now, playing is a learning experience and in preschool it should be, in kindergarten it should be. [applause]\nThat doesn't mean they can't be learning at the same time. And that\u2014and this debate that we're having seems to me to be so beside the point. It's not like either play or learn. Through play that is supervised in preschool, you will learn if it's done right. That's why we want quality preschool. Right? And so it's a way of unleashing creativity and allowing, you know, little kids' personalities to develop.\nI just\u2014in the classroom where I just was, I was handed this book of drawings. Each of the kids did a drawing about what they want to be when they grow up. And, you know, they want to be a firefighter. They want to be an artist. They want to be a vet. They want to be a hair stylist. I mean, it was everything you could imagine, but that's the beginning of them thinking about envisioning adulthood.\nSo the teachers here, they look at that, and they\u2014and they\u2014you know, they'll talk about what it would mean to be a vet. Or gee, why do you want to be a hair stylist? What does that mean to you? What kind of artist do you want to be? That is just as important as anything else you can do in the classroom.\nAnd so I think that the reaction against all the testing is coming from people who believe that we have to\u2014we have to hold accountable what happens in our school. We can't just say it doesn't matter whether kids learn anything. That's not acceptable.\nBut we have to get back to thinking about the different ways kids learn, and creativity\u2014the best gift you can give a child is a creative, open, learning mind that will enable that child to pursue his or her own dreams to live up to his or her own God-given potential.\nAnd that potential may... [applause] ... may not at all be the same by anybody else's.\nSo I want to\u2014I want to give our two guests, if I can, the chance for the last word, because they\u2014they've been on the front lines.\nUNKNOWN: Thanks, Secretary.\nYou know, we're just delighted again that this is part of a discourse in the presidential campaign, having early childhood education. And it really is in those earliest years\u2014more than numeracy and literacy, it's those essential life skills, like you mentioned, perseverance, working in teams, ability to problem-solve, creativity that can make all the difference in preparing them for their future.\nThank you.\nThank you so much for this conversation. [applause]\nJackie and I were talking earlier with so many in the room that have been down in the trenches with us for the last 25 or more years that we've been doing this in New Hampshire.\nAnd it is so wonderful to have this discussion today that we are having and to have so many people know what early childhood is, know what it means, to have seen that brain development going through from zero to age five and understand the importance of this.\nAnd we are so welcome to have this piece. Thank you. [applause]\nSo that concludes our program today, and I just wanted to thank you all very much for coming out to the YMCA of Strafford County and thank Secretary Clinton. [applause]\n","19":"\nThank you! Oh, thank you all! Thank you so very, very much.\nIt is wonderful to be here with all of you.\nTo be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.\nTo be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.\nTo be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt's enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.\nAnd in a place... with absolutely no ceilings.\nYou know, President Roosevelt's Four Freedoms are a testament to our nation's unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.\nTwo Democrats guided by the \u2014 Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.\nPresident Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said there's no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: \"Equality of opportunity... Jobs for those who can work... Security for those who need it... The ending of special privilege for the few... The preservation of civil liberties for all... a wider and constantly rising standard of living.\"\nThat still sounds good to me.\nIt's America's basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.\nThat bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.\nIt's what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.\nIt's what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.\nWhen President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.\nWhen President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.\nBut, it's not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.\nWe're still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.\nInstead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.\nWhat happened?\nWell, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.\nExcept it wasn't the end.\nAs we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.\nYou worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs... you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again \u2014 going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.\nSo we're standing again. But, we all know we're not yet running the way America should.\nYou see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.\nWhile many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America's kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.\nSo, you have to wonder: \"When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?\" \"When?\"\nI say now.\nProsperity can't be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.\nDemocracy can't be just for billionaires and corporations.\nProsperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.\nYou brought our country back.\nNow it's time \u2014 your time to secure the gains and move ahead.\nAnd, you know what?\nAmerica can't succeed unless you succeed.\nThat is why I am running for President of the United States.\nHere, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.\nI'm running to make our economy work for you and for every American.\nFor the successful and the struggling.\nFor the innovators and inventors.\nFor those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.\nFor the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.\nFor the nurses who work the night shift.\nFor the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.\nFor the veterans who served our country.\nFor the small business owners who took a risk.\nFor everyone who's ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.\nI'm not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.\nOur country's challenges didn't begin with the Great Recession and they won't end with the recovery.\nFor decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.\nAdvances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.\nThe financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value... too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.\nOur political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they've lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.\nNow, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we've made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.\nOur next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that \u2014 to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.\nAt our best, that's what Americans do. We're problem solvers, not deniers. We don't hide from change, we harness it.\nBut we can't do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.\nAmericans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.\nNow, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they're all singing the same old song...\nA song called \"Yesterday.\"\nYou know the one \u2014 all our troubles look as though they're here to stay... and we need a place to hide away... They believe in yesterday.\nAnd you're lucky I didn't try singing that, too, I'll tell you!\nThese Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.\nWe've heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.\nAsk many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they'll say: \"I'm not a scientist.\" Well, then, why don't they start listening to those who are?\nThey pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.\nThey want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.\nThey shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.\nThey want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.\nAnd they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.\nFundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called \"a village\" that has a place for everyone.\nNow, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.\nI believe that success isn't measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty...\nHow many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive...\nHow many young people go to college without drowning in debt...\nHow many people find a good job...\nHow many families get ahead and stay ahead.\nI didn't learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.\nMy mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.\nHer own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.\nYou know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.\nThe 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.\nThe woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.\nAnd, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.\nThat's why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.\nTo meet every challenge.\nTo be resilient... no matter what the world throws at you.\nTo solve the toughest problems.\nI believe we can do all these things because I've seen it happen.\nAs a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.\nMy first job out of law school was for the Children's Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn't go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.\nAs a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.\nIn Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.\nAs Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9\/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.\nIt took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.\nThere are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.\nJust weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.\nShe doesn't expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isn't quite so hard for families like hers?\nI want to be her champion and your champion.\nIf you'll give me the chance, I'll wage and win Four Fights for you.\nThe first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.\nTo make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.\nThe middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can't have one without the other.\nIs this possible in today's world?\nI believe it is or I wouldn't be standing here.\nDo I think it will be easy? Of course not.\nBut, here's the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we can't stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.\nThere are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.\nBusiness leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.\nThere are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.\nThere are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow's economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.\nIn the coming weeks, I'll propose specific policies to:\nReward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck \u2014 because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.\nI will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.\nI will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.\nWe will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.\nWe will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.\nAnd we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\nDeveloping renewable power \u2014 wind, solar, advanced biofuels...\nBuilding cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings...\nUsing additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment...\nAnd ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.\nNow, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.\nWe will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.\nWe will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.\nNow, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.\nThat's why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.\nAnd I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.\nOne thing I've learned is that talent is universal \u2014 you can find it anywhere \u2014 but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.\nOur country won't be competitive or fair if we don't help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.\nSo let's staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.\nLet's make college affordable and available to all ...and lift the crushing burden of student debt.\nLet's provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.\nNow, the second fight is to strengthen America's families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.\nAnd today's families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.\nI believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.\nI believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.\nI believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.\nThat you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.\nI believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.\nAnd it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job \u2014 and women of color often making even less.\nThis isn't a women's issue. It's a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.\nIn America, every family should feel like they belong.\nSo we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.\nAnd, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.\nYou know, America's diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what's drawn so many to our shores. What's inspired people all over the world. I know. I've seen it with my own eyes.\nAnd these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.\nSo we have a third fight: to harness all of America's power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.\nNo other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran \u2014 and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.\nNo other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.\nAs your President, I'll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.\nAnd if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.\nAs a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today's threats and tomorrow's.\nAnd when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, I'll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they've earned.\nI've stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.\nBut, I know \u2014 I know we have to be smart as well as strong.\nMeeting today's global challenges requires every element of America's power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.\nThere are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there's a lot of good news out there too.\nI believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.\nAnd we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. That's why we have to win the fourth fight \u2014 reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.\nWe have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.\nWe need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen's right to vote, rather than every corporation's right to buy elections.\nIf necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United.\nI want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. That's why I've proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.\nI'll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.\nWhat part of democracy are they afraid of?\nNo matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.\nGovernment is never going to have all the answers \u2014 but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.\nThat means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.\nWe need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.\nThere's so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.\nTo do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.\nNow, I'll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But I'll also stand my ground when I must.\nThat's something I did as Senator and Secretary of State \u2014 whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities \u2014 and it's something I will always do as your President.\nWe Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other's back.\nLike any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.\nPeople all over the world have asked me: \"How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?\"\nNow, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled \u2014 even killed \u2014 not hired as Secretary of State.\nBut President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. That's how we do it in America.\nWith that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.\nWe can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.\nWe can strengthen our families.\nWe can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.\nAnd we can renew the promise of our democracy.\nIf we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.\nI want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.\nTalk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.\nText \"JOIN\" to 4-7-2-4-6.\nGo to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to make calls and knock on doors.\nIt's no secret that we're going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But I've spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I'm not stopping now.\nYou know, I know how hard this job is. I've seen it up close and personal.\nAll our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.\nWell, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!\nAnd the first grandmother as well.\nAnd one additional advantage: You're won't see my hair turn white in the White House. I've been coloring it for years!\nSo I'm looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I'm not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.\nAnd along the way, I'll just let you in on this little secret. I won't get everything right. Lord knows I've made my share of mistakes. Well, there's no shortage of people pointing them out!\nAnd I certainly haven't won every battle I've fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.\nI think you know by now that I've been called many things by many people \u2014 \"quitter\" is not one of them.\nLike so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.\nWhen I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. I'd come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\nI can still hear her saying: \"Life's not about what happens to you, it's about what you do with what happens to you \u2014 so get back out there.\"\nShe lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century \u2014 all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.\nShe was born on June 4, 1919 \u2014 before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.\nThe story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us \u2014 not just some, but all \u2014 should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.\nNot only because we're a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we're a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.\nI wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.\nI wish she could have seen the America we're going to build together.\nAn America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.\nWhere we don't leave anyone out, or anyone behind.\nAn America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.\nThank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America.\n","20":"\nWow! Thank you so very much. I cannot tell you how personally honored I am to be here with all of you, to be at this historic institution. Let me start by thanking President Rudley, everyone at Texas Southern university. It's a great treat to be here, to have heard just briefly from Dr. Rudley and others about the incredible programs and progress and the fact that you graduated more than 1,000 young people into the world not so many days ago. This institution is the living legacy, the absolute embodiment of Heman Marion Sweatt and the long struggle for civil rights. and for me, to be surrounded by so many here in Houston, Texas, and indeed from across our country, who were part of that movement is especially touching. I am delighted to be here with my friend, Sheila Jackson Lee, she has been a tireless champion for the people of the 18th District and state and the country.\nI have to tell you though I thought she would tell you about the most important news coming out of Congress. And that is she is finally a member of the grandmother's club. And as a member of now a little over eight months, it is the best club you will ever be a member of, Sheila. I have to tell you I was excited to come here and to talk about an issue that is important to Barbara Jordan and should be important to all of us. But to do so in front of Dr. Freeman is a little daunting. I mean anyone who knows what this man has meant, not only to Barbara Jordan but to so many who have studied here who have been in anyway effected by his brilliant teaching, elocution and delivery would be a little daunted too. I noticed that both Dr. Rudley and Dr. Sheila both got off before Dr. Freeman came up.\nI also want to say my thoughts and prayers are with all the families in Houston and across Texas affected by the recent terrible flooding. And I am confident that this community will embrace them. I remember very well coming here after Katrina with my husband, and in fact we decided to invite along a young Senator from Illinois by the name of Barack Obama, along and with Sheila and other leaders in the community. We toured the facilities that Houston had provided to those who were fleeing that horrific storm. And I saw how people had opened their hearts and their homes. This is a city that knows how to pull together, and I'm confident you'll do so again on behalf of those who are suffering from this latest terrible disaster.\nAnd it is also a special moment to be here, knowing that Barbara Jordan was succeeded by Mickey Leland and the 18th District was so well represented for so long, and I am delighted to be here with Alison and to remember the pioneering work he did on behalf of children and the poor and hungry. So many issues that he was the champion of. And I want to thank Rosemary McGowan and all the friends and loved ones of Barbara Jordan here today. This is such a particular honor for me because the award is in memory of one of my true personal heroes\u2014a woman who taught me and so many others the meaning of courage and determination in the pursuit of justice.\nI first met Barbara Jordan when I was a young attorney and had been given a position working for the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee investigating Richard Nixon, and it was such a profound moment in American history. And there wasn't anyone who was a more effective eloquent inquisitor than Barbara Jordan.\nAs a 26-year-old fresh out of law school, as some of you are perhaps now having graduated from the Thurgood Marshall School here at TSU, I was riveted and not a little intimidated to tell you the truth by this unstoppable Congresswoman from Texas. I got to talk with her, which was thrilling, I got to hand her papers, which was equally exciting, but mostly I got to watch and listen to her.\nAt a time of shaken confidence, she stirred the entire nation with her words.\nRemember what she said: \"My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete; it is total.\"\nIt was that passion and moral clarity that took Barbara Jordan from the TSU and the halls of Texas legislature all the ways to the halls of Congress. The first woman and the first African American ever elected to represent Texas in the House of Representatives.\nAnd she defended and continued the civil rights legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and her friend and mentor President Lyndon Johnson\u2014and in particular she was a staunch advocate for the Voting Rights Act, which had helped make it possible for her to be elected.\nIn 1975, in the face of fierce opposition, Barbara Jordan led the fight to extend the special protections of the Voting Rights Act to many more Americans, including Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans as well.\nAnd like every woman who has run for national office in this country in the last four decades, I stand here on the shoulders of Barbara Jordan and so does our entire country.\nAnd boy do we miss her. We miss her courage, we also miss her humor, she was funny and most of all her irresistible voice.\nI remember talking to her and Ann Richards one time. And between the two of them, forget trying to get a word in at all. And they were telling me about how they would love to go to the University of Texas women's basketball games. Right, and Barbara would be there by that time in her wheelchair, and Ann would be holding court right next to her. And Barbara would be yelling directions like she was, you know, the coach. \"Why are you doing that? Jump higher! That's not a pass!\" You know, all of those kinds of sideline comments. And so Ann was telling me this, with Barbara right there and I finally turned to her and said, \"Barbara, encourage these young women, don't just criticize them.\" And Barbara turned around and said, \"When they deserve it, I will.\"\nWe sure could use her irresistible voice. I wish we could hear that voice one more time.\nHear her express the outrage we feel about the fact that 40 years after Barbara Jordan fought to extend the Voting Rights Act, its heart has been ripped out.\nAnd I wish we could hear her speak up for the student who has to wait for hours for his or her right to vote. For the grandmother who's turned away from the polls because her driver's license expired. For the father who's done his time and paid his debt to society but still hasn't gotten his rights back.\nNow we know, unfortunately, Barbara isn't here to speak up for them and so many others. But we are. And we have a responsibility to say clearly and directly what's really going on in our country\u2014because what is happening is a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people, and young people from one end of our country to the other.\nBecause since the Supreme Court eviscerated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, many of the states that previously faced special scrutiny because of a history of racial discrimination have proposed and passed new laws that make it harder than ever to vote.\nNorth Carolina passed a bill that went after pretty much anything that makes voting more convenient or more accessible. Early voting. Same-day registration. The ability of county election officials to even extend voting hours to accommodate long lines.\nNow what possible reason could there be to end pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and eliminate voter outreach in high schools?\nWe should be doing everything we can to get our young people more engaged in democracy, not less.\nIn fact I would say it is a cruel irony\u2014but no coincidence\u2014that Millennials, the most diverse, tolerant, and inclusive generation in American history, are now facing so much exclusion.\nAnd we need look no further than right here in Texas. You all know this far better than I, but if you want to vote in this state, you can use a concealed weapon permit as a valid form of identification\u2014but a valid student ID isn't good enough?\nNow, Krystal Watson found out the hard way. She grew up in Louisiana but came to Marshall, Texas, to attend Wiley College. Krystal takes her responsibilities as a citizen so seriously that not only did she register to vote in Texas, where she was living and would be for a number of years, she even became a deputy registrar to help other people vote as well. But this past year, when she showed up at her local polling place with a Wiley College ID, she was turned away.\nExperts estimate that hundreds of thousands of registered voters in Texas may face similar situations.\nAnd while high-profile state laws like those in Texas and North Carolina get most of the attention, many of the worst offenses against the right to vote actually happen below the radar. Like when authorities shift poll locations and election dates. Or scrap language assistance for non-English speakers\u2014something Barbara Jordan fought so hard for.\nWithout the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, no one outside the local community is likely to ever hear about these abuses, let alone have a chance to challenge them and end them.\nIt's not a surprise for you to hear that studies and everyday experiences confirm that minority voters are more likely than white voters to wait in long lines at the polls. They are also far more likely to vote in polling places with insufficient numbers of voting machines.\nIn South Carolina, for example, there's supposed to be one machine for every 250 voters. But in minority areas, that rule is just often overlooked. In Richland Country, nearly 90 percent of the precincts failed to meet the standard required by law in 2012. Instead of 250 voters per machine, in one precinct it was more than 430 voters per machine. Not surprisingly, people trying to cast a ballot there faced massive delays.\nNow there are many fair-minded, well-intentioned election officials and state legislators all over this country. But this kind of disparity that I just mentioned does not happen by accident.\nNow some of you may have heard me or my husband say one of our favorite sayings from Arkansas, of course I learned it from him. \"You find a turtle on a fence post, it did not get there on its own.\" Well, all of these problems with voting did not just happen by accident. And it is just wrong, it's wrong to try to prevent, undermine, inhibit Americans' rights to vote. Its counter to the values we share. And at a time when so many Americans have lost trust in our political system, it's the opposite of what we should be doing in our country.\nThis is the greatest, longest-lasting democracy in the history of the world. We should be clearing the way for more people to vote, not putting up every roadblock anyone can imagine.\nYet unfortunately today, there are people who offer themselves to be leaders whose actions have undercut this fundamental American principle.\nHere in Texas, former Governor Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters. He applauded when the Voting Rights Act was gutted, and said the lost protections were \"outdated and unnecessary.\"\nBut Governor Perry is hardly alone in his crusade against voting rights.\nIn Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote.\nIn New Jersey, Governor Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting.\nAnd in Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000.\nThankfully in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off.\nSo today, Republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of American citizens from voting. What part of democracy are they afraid of?\nI believe every citizen has the right to vote. And I believe we should do everything we can to make it easier for every citizen to vote.\nI call on Republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they're so scared of letting citizens have their say.\nYes, this is about democracy. But it's also about dignity. About the ability to stand up and say, yes, I am a citizen. I am an American. My voice counts. And no matter where you come from or what you look like or how much money you have, that means something. In fact, it means a lot.\nI learned those lessons right here in Texas, registering voters in south Texas down in the valley in 1972.\nSome of the people I met were, understandably, a little wary of a girl from Chicago who didn't speak a word of Spanish. But they wanted to vote. They were citizens. They knew they had a right to be heard. They wanted to exercise all the rights and responsibilities that citizenship conveys. That's what should matter because when those rights are denied to anyone, we're all the worse for it. It doesn't just hold back the aspirations of individual citizens. It holds back our entire country.\nThat's why, as a Senator, I championed a bill called the Count Every Vote Act. If it had become law, it would have made Election Day a federal holiday and mandated early voting opportunities. Deceiving voters, including by sending flyers into minority neighborhoods with false voting times and places, would have become a federal crime. And many Americans with criminal convictions who had paid their debts to society would have finally gotten their voting rights back.\nWell today, with the damage to the Voting Rights Act so severe, the need for action is even more urgent.\nFirst, Congress should move quickly to pass legislation to repair that damage and restore the full protections that American voters need and deserve.\nI was in the Senate in 2006 when we voted 98 to zero to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act after an exhaustive review process.\nThere had been more than 20 hearings in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Testimony from expert witnesses. Investigative reports documenting continuing discrimination in covered jurisdictions. There were more than 15,000 pages of legislative record. Now that is how the system is supposed to work. You gather the evidence, you weigh it and you decide. And we did 98 to nothing. We put principle ahead of politics. That is what Congress needs to do again.\nSecond, we should implement the recommendations of the bipartisan presidential commission to improve voting. That commission was chaired by President Obama's campaign lawyer and by Governor Mitt Romney campaign's lawyer. And they actually agreed. And they set forth common sense reforms, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting. Providing online voter registration. Establishing the principle that no one should ever have to wait more than 30 minutes to cast your vote.\nThird, we should set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person voting everywhere\u2014including opportunities for weekend and evening voting. If families coming out of church on Sunday before an election are inspired to go vote, they should be free to do just that. And we know that early in-person voting will reduce those long lines and give more citizens the chance to participate, especially those who have work or family obligations that make it difficult to get to the polls on Election Day.\nIt's not just convenient\u2014it's also more secure, more reliable, and more affordable than absentee voting. So let's get this done.\nAnd I believe we should go even further to strengthen voting rights in America. So today I am calling for universal, automatic voter registration. Every citizen, every state in the Union. Everyone, every young man or young woman should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18\u2014unless they actively choose to opt out. But I believe this would have a profound impact on our elections and our democracy. Between a quarter and a third of all eligible Americans remain unregistered and therefore unable to vote.\nAnd we should modernize our entire approach to registration. The current system is a relic from an earlier age. It relies on a blizzard of paper records and it's full of errors.\nWe can do better. We can make sure that registration rolls are secure, up to date, and complete. When you move, your registration should move with you. If you are an eligible vote and want to be registered, you should be a registered voter\u2014period.\nNow, Oregon is already leading the way modernizing its system, and the rest of the country should follow. The technology is there. States have a lot of the data already. It's just a matter of syncing and streamlining.\nNow, all of these reforms, from expanded early voting to modernized registration, are common sense ways to strengthen our democracy. But I'll be candid here, none of them will come easily.\nIt's going to take leadership at many levels.\nNow more than ever, we need our citizens to actually get out and vote for people who want to hear what is on their minds.\nWe need more activists working to expose abuses, educate Americans about their rights, and hold authorities accountable for protecting them. Some of the worst provisions in recent laws have been blocked or delayed by tireless advocates raising the alarm and filing legal challenges. But they can't do it alone.\nWe need more grassroots mobilization efforts like the Moral Monday movement in North Carolina to build momentum for reform.\nWe need more Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen's right to vote, I mean the principle underlying our Constitution, which we had to fight for a long time to make apply to everybody, one person, one vote and we need a Supreme Court that cares more about protecting the right to vote of a person than the right to buy and election of a corporation.\nBut of course, you know what we really need? We need more elected leaders from Houston to Austin to Washington who will follow in the footsteps of Barbara Jordan and fight for the rights and opportunities of everyday Americans, not just those at the top of the ladder. And we need to remember that progress is built on common ground, not scorched earth.\nYou know, when I traveled around the world as your Secretary of State, one of the most frequent questions I was asked was, \"How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard in that campaign?\"\nPeople were genuinely amazed, which I suppose is understandable, considering that in many places, when you lose an election or you oppose someone who wins you could get imprisoned or exiled\u2014even killed\u2014not hired as Secretary of State.\nAnd it's true, I was surprised when the President asked me to serve. But he made that offer, and I accepted it, because we both love our country.\nSo my friends, here at this historic institution let us remember that America was built by people who knew that our common interest was more important than our self-interest. They were fearless in pursuit of a stronger, freer, and fairer nation.\nAs Barbara Jordan famously reminded us, when the Constitution was first written, it left most of us here out. But generations of Americans fought and marched and organized and prayed to expand the circle of freedom and opportunity. They never gave up and never backed down.\nAnd nearly a century ago on this very day, after years of struggle, Congress finally passed the 19th amendment to give women the right to vote in the United States.\nSo that is, that is the story of progress, courageous men and women, expanding rights, not restricting them. And today we refuse, we refuse to allow our country or this generation of leaders to slow or reverse America's long march toward a more perfect union.\nWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to fight just as hard as those who came before us did. To march just as far. To organize just as well. To speak out just as loudly. And to vote, every chance we get for the kind of future we want.\nThat's what Barbara Jordan would do. That's what we should do in honor of her.\nThank you, and may God bless you.\n","21":"\nWell, this is so exciting, to be here with all of you and to be here for such an important cause, to make sure that the Democratic Party and particularly the Democratic Women's Council recruits and trains and fields more women for public office right here in South Carolina. There are a lot of longtime friends here; I won't try to mention everybody, but I do want to thank Susan and the entire board for DWC. And I want to thank Gilda, who I think has been in the state legislature since '92, started in elementary school and worked her way up. Former Governor Jim Hodges, we're delighted he is here, thank you. A national Democratic chair, a state Democratic chair, of course Don and Carroll Fowler, so happy to see them. Your candidate for the Senate last time, Joyce Dikerson, thank you Joyce.\nI was thinking on the way down here that I first came to South Carolina as a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund, started by your own South Carolina native Marian Wright Edelman from Bennettsville. I came back many times going to Renaissance weekend, going to Hilton Head, then going to Charleston. Made a lot of friends, had a lot of good times, and am thrilled to be back, and I'm back because I want to support you.\nYou know, the theme of this day of events is how to build a party and how to build a party that really respects and includes women and gives women in this state a chance to not only be at the table but at the head of the table. Carrying with them their Democratic experiences and their life experiences. And you're right, I am running to live again at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But I don't want to be there all by myself\u2014I want Democrats elected from the local to the county to the state to the federal level, once again making the case that when Democrats win, Americans win.\nI want to say just a few words about what's happening to America's families and what's happening with our economy. Because I've always believed fundamentally that when families are strong, America is strong.\nAnd we've come through some really tough economic times. I looked at the statistics and South Carolina has pulled itself up and other places have as well. American families have made a lot of sacrifices. People lost jobs, people lost homes, people had to put college on the back burner, retirement on the back burner. But everybody just kept going. It took a lot of determination, and across America we're beginning to see the results of all that hard work. And I will say that there does seem to be a pattern, Democratic presidents, and there are two in particular that I'm thinking of, over the last 35 years, seem to inherit a mess of problems. Have you noticed that? So then they have to dig us out of the ditches they find themselves in and put us back on the right track, and of course I'm talking about Bill Clinton and Barrack Obama, but of course presidents don't do it alone\u2014they do it with the American people. It's a partnership.\nAnd today we are standing again, but we're not yet running. And we face a choice: Are we going to hand over our country once again to people and policies that crashed our economy before and that will shred all the progress we've made?\n[Crowd shouts NO!]\nWell that's obviously the right answer, but that's what this campaign is going to be about. Because we're going to have to stand up to the people who want to keep the deck stacked in favor of those at the top. We are going to fight to make sure that the success of our country is shared across the economy and that more families have the chance to get ahead and not just to get by but to stay moving forward with the kind of confidence and optimism that has always marked the best times in America.\nIt's time to make the words \"middle class\" mean something again. They should represent a solemn promise that anyone willing to work hard can earn a decent living and a better life, not just get by paycheck to paycheck.\nThat's the middle class I grew up in. My dad was a small businessman, and when I say small, it was small. He ran a small drapery printing business. And he literally had a print plant with big long tables that had silk screens, and sometimes my mother, my brothers, and I would help to pour the paint in and take the squeegee and then we'd walk down the table, print the fabrics, and then he'd go out and sell them. And it was a good decent middle-class life that he provided to my brothers and me. And I am so grateful, and there was never in my mind in fact that's what so many of us believed when we were growing up. The future seemed so unlimited\u2014of course we had to fix a lot of things in the country, starting with civil rights and human rights, but the opportunity ladder always was held out there.\nI just came from Kiki's Chicken and Waffles, which I highly recommend, and I was meeting with a group of African American businesswomen, and they were telling me what they needed to keep growing and build an even better future, it sounded so much like the conversation I remember around my dinner table. That's what links us together past all the other differences that sometimes divide us.\nBeing middle class in America should mean you feel in control of your own financial destiny.\nIt should mean you have a little more, so you can worry a little less.\nIt should mean that you can invest in your future and the future of your children, putting aside some for education, putting aside some for retirement.\nYou should be able to go to sleep at night knowing that everything you've worked for won't be lost in a flash because of decisions that are made or failed to be made in Washington.\nSo therefore, I want to be a president who makes corporations live up to the basic guarantee that when workers help produce record profits, those workers should get a real share of the rewards instead of it all going to those at the top.\nAnd you know the statistic. Something is wrong when top CEOs earn 300 times more than a typical American worker, or here is my latest least favorite statistic, the 25 biggest hedge fund managers earn more than all the kindergarten teachers in America...combined. What does that say about our values and the importance of preparing our children through education to make it in a very competitive global economy?\nToday, too many politicians who want to return to the same failed top-down economics are mouthing the words \"middle class.\" But this is something you have to believe in and something you have to be ready to fight for. If those words are going to have meaning again, they've got to be backed up by real solutions, not empty rhetoric. And those solutions have to speak to the ways that the economy has changed.\nToday, 40 percent of mothers are the sole or primary breadwinners in their household. And more Americans are working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. Parents are rushing home from work to get their kids home from school and maybe get them off to practice or rehearsal. They are squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day with barely enough time to breathe, let alone relax.\nI remember when I was a practicing lawyer back in Little Rock, and around 3 o'clock every afternoon all of the women who worked in the firm were hunched over their phones kind of whispering into them and at first I didn't know what was going on, and then I realized they were checking to see if their children got home safely.\nMany people today can't count on relatives to pitch in because so many families now are scattered across the country. Now I happen to be extremely lucky because my amazing 8-month-old granddaughter lives near me, so I get to see her a lot.\nBut nobody expects everything to come easy, that's not part of life, we know that, but it shouldn't be quite so hard to get ahead and stay ahead.\nSo I do believe that everyday Americans and their families need a champion. A champion who will fight for them every single day. Not for some Americans but for all Americans. And I want to be that champion. I want to get up every single day going to work for you, standing up for you, making a difference for you.\nNow, take the issue of equal pay. I don't think I'm letting you in on a secret when I say, too many women still earn less than men on the job. And women of color often make even less. And then there's the so called, motherhood penalty, with many women taking a pay cut when they have children. All this lost money adds up. For many families, we're talking about thousands of dollars every year. That's money that could go for rent or groceries or a new car or into the college fund. Now we could fix this. If Republicans would get on board, we in fact could fix this today but they won't.\nOne Republican candidate dismissed equal pay as \"a bogus issue.\" Another said Congress was \"wasting time\" worrying about it. One even said that efforts to guarantee fair pay reminded him of the Soviet Union.\nAnd to that I say what century are they living in?\nBut thankfully the American people know the truth. And the truth is that when any parent is short-changed, the entire family is short-changed. And when families are short-changed, America is short-changed. And therefore this is not a women's issue this is a family issue and an American economic issue.\nAnd here's what we should do instead to close the wage gap. First, we should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which gives women the legal tools we need to fight discrimination at work.\nI introduced this legislation in the Senate back in 2005 and kept sponsoring it again and again. Well it's time to get this done, once and for all.\nSecond, we should promote pay transparency across our economy to ensure women have the information they need to negotiate fairly. You can't stand up for equal pay if you don't know whether you're paid equally. You remember the Lilly Ledbetter case, she didn't know for the longest that she wasn't being paid the same as her male coworkers doing the same jobs. Postings for new jobs or promotions should come with salary ranges. Large companies should report on how fairly, or not, they're compensating workers, male or female.\nAnd we should applaud those businesses and communities that are leading the way with best practices and real accountability. I think transparency when it comes to pay is our friend. The more we can bring it out from under the table to put it on top, the more information we can have to advocate for ourselves and advocate for each other.\nThird, we need to raise wages for the lowest paid jobs in America -- which are, they are disproportionately held by women, especially women of color\u2014we need to make it easier for more women to enter higher paying fields like science and engineering and technology. But I want to say something that a lot of people may not know even in this room full of activist and well informed democrats.\nIn most states today, waitresses, bartenders, hairstylists, and others who rely on tips are paid even lower than minimum wage.\nSome are paid as little as two dollars and thirteen cents an hour. And they are also more likely to face exploitation, wage theft, and sexual harassment. Think about somebody you may know, think about the mom trying to succeed at work and give her kids the support they need with a job that pays her $2.13 an hour. And forces her to put up with some pretty awful behavior by clients or customers or bosses to try to get those tips to at least push it up to the federal minimum wage level.\nAnd finally, we need workplace policies like paid leave and flexible scheduling that allow parents to take care of their obligations at home without sacrificing pay at work.\nNow, it's no secret that on equal pay and so many other issues, we're up against some pretty powerful forces, political and economic, that will do say and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. I'm here to tell you I'm not afraid to take them on.\nYou know I've spent my adult life going to bat for children, families, and our country.\nAnd I do know how hard this job I'm seeking is. I have seen it up close and personal. You're not going to catch me wondering what it's like. Instead I'm spending my time planning for what I will do for you when I get there.\nAll our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. Think about what they look like on inauguration day and then we watch them they grow grayer and grayer, and by the time they leave they're as white as the building they live in.\nWell, let me tell you, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I have one big advantage. I've been coloring my hair for years. So you're not going to see me turn white in the White House. And you're also not going to see me shrink from a fight. I think by now people know I don't quit.\nSo I hope you'll join me. I hope you'll help me build this campaign, make it your own. Tell your friends to go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer.\nThis election is not about me. It's about us. And it has to be about what we will do together to restore faith, confidence and optimism in the future and the country we love.\nI want to end with a story, some of you might remember we had a pretty vigorous campaign in 2008.\nI vaguely recall. And both President Obama and I worked really hard and he won and I lost and then I went to work to make sure he'd win. And I was so relieved, I was just so relieved when finally November 2008 came around and he did.\nAnd then a few days after the election, my husband and I were taking a walk in a little forested area near where we live, and his phone went off, and he answered it, and it was the president-elect, who said, \"Bill, I need to talk to you, and I want to talk to Hillary.\" And Bill said, \"Well, we're in the middle of a forest, but as soon as we get home we'll call.\" So we did, and the president-elect talked to Bill about the ideas he had and the cabinet and economic problems that he was all of a sudden being confronted with that he hadn't even been told about to the extent they were. So Bill talked to him and then hands me the phone, and the president-elect says, \"I want you to come to Chicago to meet with me.\" And so I said, \"Certainly, when would you like me to come?\" And he says, \"As soon as you can come.\" And I thought he wanted to talk to me about what I would do in the Senate to try to support what he was going to be championing as president.\nSo I went a few days later, go into this big office building and sit down with the president-elect, and he says to me, \"I want you to be my secretary of state.\" And I said \"Well, Mr. President-elect, I'm honored, I'm flattered, but there are so many other people,\" and I gave him names of people that I thought would have been great secretaries of state. And he says, \"No, no, I have to spend all my time dealing with this economy, it's worse than we were even told, and yet we have all these problems around the world and I need somebody who I can send out there to go anywhere to talk to anyone, and I want it to be you.\" I said, \"Well, I can't tell you how moved I am, but I have to go back to the Senate.\" And he said, \"Now, I don't want to hear from you until you say yes.\" So I go back to the airport and get on the plane. I go back to New York and I'm thinking, you know, the right thing for me is to stay in the Senate, the people of New York had had a rough time. I became senator, and eight months later we had 9\/11, and so I had spent most of my first term trying to help people and rebuild our city and protect it and everything and I just thought I needed to go back.\nSo I called the president-elect and said, \"You know, again I cannot tell you how honored I am, and I will support you in any way I can, but I need to go back to the Senate, and so I must say no, Mr. President elect.\" He said, \"I told you I didn't want to hear from you until you're ready to say yes.\" And so I say to my husband, you know, \"Can you believe this? I mean the president-elect has asked me to be secretary of state, I told him no twice, and he says he's not going to give up until I say yes.\" Bill says, \"Well as I remember it, I asked you to marry me twice before you said yes. He said you might stop and think that maybe there is a pattern here.\" So I stayed up all night ,and I thought, you know, suppose it had been reversed, and I had been fortunate enough to win, and I wanted somebody to be in my cabinet that I knew I could rely on and I had asked the president-elect. I would have wanted him to say yes, because the country was facing some very serious decisions. So I called him back the next day, and I said \"OK, Mr. President, I am honored, I will be your secretary of state,\" and from that moment on we began to talk and to work together.\nFast forward to my first trip I go to Asia in February 2009, and I go because when I started calling presidents, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. They all said we didn't know what to expect because nobody's been paying a lot of attention to us. And I said well that is going to change, because the president and I see Asia as a very important priority, and I will come, so I was on my way.\nOne of the countries I was going to was Indonesia, and I agreed to do both the private meetings with the leaders and press conferences, the kinds of things you see on TV, and to do a lot of what's called public diplomacy, where we would reach out to people, and we would basically say, we care about you we're back we want to work with you. Let's try to find ways that we can be partners and send a different message.\nSo I agreed to go on this show in Jakarta called the \"Awesome Show.\" And it was the early morning show, and it was unlike anything I've even seen on our TV, and you know you see anything on our TV these days, people are jumping up and down, they're singing, they're dancing, and I'm sitting here thinking, \"Oh my gosh, I hope they don't ask me to sing or dance\". But thankfully they didn't. They did an interview, and then they said the audience, \"Does anybody have any questions?\" So somebody raised a hand and was called on. So this person said, \"I want to ask you something. We followed your election.\" I found that people overseas followed our election, in some ways closer than some Americans, really followed it, and so this questioner said, \"We followed your election, it was really a hard, long-fought election\" because as you know our elections last forever compared to most other countries which have elections. And he says, \"We saw you and President Obama going at it, he was saying bad things about you, you were saying back things about him, and then all of a sudden you end up as his secretary of state? How does that work?\" And I thought, you know this is a really serious question, because in lots of places you run against somebody, you can be exiled, imprisoned, or killed, not made Secretary of State, so I thought that there was a moment here that if I could rev my brain up that maybe could reach particularly young people because Indonesia is a relatively young democracy. So I said, \"You're right, we ran a very hard campaign against each other. He won, I lost, and then I went to work for him because he and I shared many of the same positions about what should be done in the next presidency and then he won and then he asked me to be Secretary of State for the same reason, we both love our country.\"\nAnd no matter how hard this election or any election becomes we should remember that at the core we can have disagreements, and we will, we have different governing philosophies, we have different views about what works, what the evidence shows works about economic policies, that's all fair game, but we should show more respect toward each other and we should remember why we're doing this, because we love our country, and we want it to be the country of hope and potential for our children and our grandchildren that many of us saw come into being over the last decades so as I run for President we're going to have some very difficult challenges. We'll have disagreements, we'll have debates, but I want you to know that I will be remembering what I think should be at the core of every political campaign, how we treat one another, and how we care for this gift we've been given, the United States of America. Thank you very much.\n","22":"\nWow, what a great way to begin and to all of you especially Mary Carmen and LaKeisha thank you for speaking on behalf of providers and parents. We're going to hear from everybody as we go through our event today. I want to thank everyone at New Horizons for welcoming us to this facility. And to all my friends at SEIU as well.\nWe're here today to talk about childcare. But its important to understand that when we talk about childcare we're talking about the economy, we're talking about families, we're talking about fairness, we're talking about all of the values that we believe are necessary to raise healthy successful productive children in society today. I want to say just a few words about what's happening with our economy and more broadly about America's families. Because I think when our families are strong America is strong. And if we don't have strong families its really hard for us to be the kind of strong nation that sets the table for our children to do better.\nWe've come back from really tough economic times. The great recession just really knocked people to the ground. People lost their jobs, they lost their homes they postponed doing things like going to college, they had to keep working if they had a job even if they were at or beyond retirement. It really took a lot out of everybody. And we are in much better shape today in large measure because families made the sacrifice and worked really hard despite the odds. They took extra jobs like some of you they skipped what were really necessities but they figured out how to make them not as urgent a need, like not driving the car as much or not buying all the food that the family required. So everybody made it work.\nBut the deck is still stacked for those at the top. Something is wrong when top CEOs earn 300 times more than what the average worker earns and I heard a statistic the other day that was kind of related to what we're talking about today, if you take the salaries, the compensation, of the top 25 hedge fund managers in America, those 25 men make more than all the kindergarten teachers in the country put together. Now I happen to think that kindergarten teachers and child care providers and child development specialists are really important because they are the people that are helping to get our kids off to a good start working with families.\nAnd I'm running for President because I think everyday Americans need a champion, a champion that gets up every single day and goes to work and goes to bat and does everything I can to help families just get by which is what you were talking about. I want you to get ahead and stay ahead. I want to make the words \"middle class\" mean something again.\nNow, when we think about strong families being the backbone of our country, we have to recognize that our economy is different and our families are different. I was born in Chicago and the families of today are not exactly the same as the family I was born into. Most families need two incomes or two jobs if there is only one parent to make ends meet. And 40 percent of moms, just like LaKeisha, are now the sole or the primary breadwinners in their household. So that's a big different from the way it was when I and others here were growing up. Yet we haven't adjusted our economy or our government programs to take those differences into account. You know I can remember very well when I was a young lawyer before I had my daughter in my law firm where I worked in Arkansas, around 3 o'clock I'd see all the women who worked there sort of whispering into their phones and I didn't know why, but it was just like clockwork, well they were trying to make sure their kids got home safely because their kids were walking home or getting off the bus and going home waiting for mom to get home. And it wasn't accepted back then that you could be a good worker and a devoted parent at the same time, especially for women. But that kind of juggling act is what most of us do all the time now and therefore we have to adjust how we support families so that you can be the best you can be and how we support small businesses like so many child care providers so you can make a living while you do what you love.\nSo we know that with Moms and Dads squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day and with you Mary Carmen saying you work 17 hours, it's hard to even find time to breathe. And many can't count on anybody being there to help you because everyone you know is working hard and trying to make ends meet.\nSo finding high quality, affordable, flexible childcare is more important than ever. But it's also harder than ever.\nFederal and state funding for childcare has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. So it's no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent over the past decade. And now the Republican budget that is being worked on by the Congress would cut funding even more. Making it so much more difficult. America cannot turn its back on our children and our working parents. Family values are economic values. I'm going to be putting forth plans to fix this. We should do it now. And Republicans should either get on board or get out of the way.\nBecause it's now time for us to face reality. Our families need new solutions today, they need real help not promises. And I'm very clear about what I think needs to be done but I want to hear from all of you because what I'm doing in traveling around the country is taking ideas I have, some of which I have been developing for many years, but hearing from people on the front lines, whether its immigration or small business or today child care.\nFirst, to bring down out-of-control family costs, we need to make investments in childcare a national priority.\nWhat President Obama has proposed is a good start. I'll look for responsible ways to go even further, whether it's providing tax cuts to new parents or grants to states targeted for infants and toddlers. Whatever its going to take to give both LaKeisha and the providers more opportunities. And you know its embarrassing, I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State, there are only 9 countries left in the world that have no form of paid family leave, and we are one of them. And the other ones are tiny countries, countries without many resources. Every other country has something that says, we think it's really important that moms bond with their newborn babies, we think its important that a dad can have some time, we think it's important that children can take care of their parents as those parents maybe are ill or failing. So we've got to have better systems in place with more support and we have to focus on quality so that all our kids have access to the best possible care. And many of you know how hard that is because you have two people helping you take care of 16 children. There are a lot of places where there would be one person trying to take care of 16 children. We have to reducing overcrowding and increasing training and most importantly we have to increase wages. Because you expect to make a living doing the most important job in the world if you have to sacrifice your own family. That doesn't make any sense to me at all.\nSo to all the childcare workers here today, I want you to know that the service and care you provide strengthens our economy, it strengthens families and helps prepare children. You should be valued for that, respected for that, and you should be paid for that.\nNow I am a new Grandmother and it's really wonderful but just being around my new 7 1\/2 month old granddaughter just reinforces what I believe, which is when when we short-change childcare workers, we short-change kids and short-change Americans' future. It makes it harder to retain the best staff. It makes it harder to keep up those high standards.\nSo we have to stand firmly together and united on behalf of your right to organize, your right to bargain collectively, your right to fighting together for the higher wages that reflect the value of your work. There is nothing more important to the family or to the support of the family, which you are, than caring for our youngest children.\nThat's why I so respect the vital work that SEIU is doing, under the leadership of President Mary Kay Henry, is so vital. I think it is absolutely essential.\nAnd I want to say something else about it, when people talk to me about the need to improve our educations system, I agree, because I want every child to have the best possible education. But education starts at birth. Education starts when that little baby comes into the world. In fact we now know, because of brain research, that about 80% of the brain is actually developed by the age of 3 and 4. If we don't take care of our babies we are short changing them on their brain development and then when we get to kindergarten no matter how hard they try, no matter how much their mom says do your best, do your homework, no matter how hard their teacher works they're going to be at a disadvantage. That's wrong, it isn't right that a child like my grandchild will have all of these opportunities because we're reading and we're talking and we're singing but we're not working 17 hour days and we're not trying to get by on $5100 after the expenses are paid. So yea, we're going to make sure that Charlotte has every chance in the world but I want every baby, everyone your babies and every baby you take care of to have exactly the same chances.\nUltimately, this is, for me, about how we work together to give every child the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. You see it in their faces when they are put in your arms from the very first minute. You want to keep that light in their eyes, you want to make sure they have every opportunity to fulfill that God-given potential. And I'm here because I want to help you and the parents you serve unlock that potential, when we unlock the full potential of every American, we can unlock the full potential and prosperity of America.\nSo for me, this is as important an as anything else that I'm going to talk about in my campaign for president. Thank you.\n","23":"\nWell first let me thank all of you in particular our round table participants for being with us today and thanks to Bike Tech for welcoming us to this amazing facility. I'm delighted to have this chance to talk more about small businesses. But I want to begin with what's happening more broadly with America's economy and America's families. Because I've always believed fundamentally that when our families are strong, our country is strong.\nAnd we've come back from very tough economic times. I don't need to tell anybody here that. Our economy and our country are in much better shape today, and in large measure because families worked so hard. They took extra jobs, they skipped vacations, they scrimped and they postponed going to college they saved and made it work.\nBut the deck is still stacked for those at the top.\nPeople aren't getting a fair shake. Something is wrong when CEOs earn more than 300 times than what the typical American worker earns and when hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a truck drivers or nurses.\nI'm running for president because everyday Americans and their families need a champion and I want to be that champion. I want families to do more than just get by \u2014 I want you to get ahead and stay ahead. I want to make the words \"middle class\" mean something again.\nNow, small businesses like Bike Tech and the ones you'll here about today have to be at the heart of that effort \u2014 creating jobs, driving growth, and giving millions of Americans the chance to live up to their God-given potential.\nNow, I did not learn this from politics \u2014 I learned it from my father who was a small business man. He had a very small business, printing drapery fabrics and then went out and sold them. My mother, my brothers and I and occasionally a few day laborers would help out with the actual printing process. That's what put food on the table and gave us a solid middle class home.\nToday, small businesses all over our country have worked their way back from the perfect storm of the crisis, when sales and credit, together, dried up at the same time. Businesses are finally starting to sort out how they can grow again, add jobs, and planning for the future.\nBut the deck is stacked here as well. Ask any small business owner, as I have, and they'll tell you: It is wrong that it is so easy for big corporations to get a break but so hard for small businesses even to get a loan. It shouldn't take longer to start a business in America than it does in Canada and France! But that is the fact.\nI want to be a small business president. A president who does make it easier to start and run a small business in this country, so it seems less like a gamble and more like an opportunity. We have to level the playing field for our small businesses.\nFirst, we need to cut the unnecessary red tape that costs small businesses time and money and keeps new entrepreneurs out. We should scrub federal regulations to find responsible ways to make life easier for small businesses, and we should offer new incentives to state and local governments to do the same, because that's where many of the obstacles still lie.\nSecond, we need to simplify tax filing and provide targeted credits and deductions for small businesses, not just the big corporations that can afford the lawyers and lobbyists to find every single loophole.\nThird, we'll use technology to expand access for small businesses into new markets, whether it's across town, across the state, or across the world. That's what I did in partnership with eBay in Upstate New York when I was a Senator. We started a public-private partnership to help small businesses that had never sold beyond their local community reach customers very far away.\nFourth, and I want to emphasize this today, I will fight to level the playing field for small businesses so they can get the financing they need to build and hire\u2026 including women and minority entrepreneurs who face extra barriers. And this morning when I was reading the Des Moines Register \u2014 big head line: REPORT: Iowa Ranks Last for Women Owned Business. This could not be a more timely article for our discussion today and although it says Iowa has made some progress it says Iowa has seen the lowest growth in the most businesses owned by women from 1997 to 2015 and women owned companies have the least economic clout in Iowa and all the states and the District of Columbia. So this is a very important issue for our whole county but I think it is especially important for our friends here in Iowa because access to credit can be as important to growing a small business as it is for the big ones.\nAnd you shouldn't have to be a Fortune 500 company to get a loan.\nFor many small businesses these loans have always come from community banks with deep local ties. But today those same local banks are being squeezed by regulations that don't make sense for their size and mission. Like endless examinations and paperwork designed for banks that measure their assets in the many billions. And when it gets harder for small banks to do their jobs it gets harder for small businesses to get their loans. We can ease these burdens for community banks without harming consumers \u2014 and without easing up one bit on the Wall Street. We should not apply the same restrictions on community banks as those needed by the big banks.\nLet's be clear about this: It's not the big banks that need relief from Washington \u2014 it's small banks and small businesses. We should be doing more to rein in risky behavior on Wall Street and \"Too Big to Fail,\" banks not less.\nI fully support the regulations in Dodd-Frank on the big banks but we should pass common sense community banking reform right now, however, the republicans in the congress insist on using this issue to give relief to community banks as a Trojan Horse for rolling back the protections for consumers and rolling back the rules for the big banks \u2014 as we're seeing right now in what Republicans are introducing \u2014 we should call it what it is: a cynical attempt to game the system for those at the top.\nOur goal should be helping community banks serve their neighbors and customers the way they always have. To make it easier to give our responsible loans to responsible small businesses so they can do what they do best, create jobs and help families get ahead.\nSo I'm eager to hear the ideas from everyone around the table. And I see some elected officials in the audience and am eager to hear your ideas. What are the obstacles you've faced and how can you overcome them? What more can we do to help small businesses grow?\n","24":"\nCLINTON: Thank you. Wow. Thank you. I am thrilled to be here with all of you.\nAnd Sarah, that was excellent. I thank you so much.\nAnd I hope you'll get to know Sarah and spend time with her and help her as she works so hard between now and February 1st.\nAnd Dean and Gary, thank you for welcoming us to your beautiful home; what a delight it is to be here with you. [applause]\nSomebody asked me the other day, well, you know, you're going to these events, where you're taking time to actually talk and listen to people, is that really what you're going to do?\nAnd I said, well, yes, it is because not only do I learn a lot but I also feel like it's the best way to make those connections that will not only give me a firm foundation in the caucus here in Iowa or in a primary in New Hampshire\u2014because it really is about people-to-people connections if we're really talking about what we want to do\u2014but it will also give me the kind of information I need to be an even better president.\nAnd I just had another example about that. You may know that Gary's a radiologist and right before we came in, we were talking about his work. He's an expert in breast cancer. And I asked him about the mammography recommendations that's at least the women in the room I'm sure have seen over the last several years.\nAnd he was giving me some really important insight into the commission that made those recommendations and his expert opinion about them. And I'm so grateful to you for that because it's the kind of discussion that you can't have unless you have an opportunity to actually talk and listen with people.\nI want to thank all of you for coming. I am delighted to have this chance to talk with you. I think what we're going to do is I'll say a few words about the campaign and what I want to achieve. And then we'll have a chance to talk individually and I'll be able to hear from each and every one of you.\nI have been incredibly impressed over the last several years at how hard the American people have worked to pull ourselves out of the Great Recession. People have made a lot of sacrifice. People have lost jobs. They lost houses. They lost the chance to finish or go on with their education. And they did everything that they could think of to do to get back on their feet.\nAnd I'm so relieved that, as I travel around the country and talk with people, there is a sense that we are on our feet. We're not running yet but we are on our feet. And we can see the changes that are happening in people's lives and put them in a context as to where we go from here now as a country.\nI'm very grateful to President Obama for the hard decisions he made when he inherited the mess that he inherited when he became president in 2009. [applause]\nAnd I know that he and I and everyone who was in his administration realizes that, unless the American family and the American worker is strong, everything we want to see happen for our country is going to be much more difficult. And so I come to this campaign committed to being a champion for Americans and American families.\nThat's what my work has been throughout my entire adult life, starting with my first job out of law school when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, all the way through to the work that I did as secretary of state promoting women's rights, promoting the rights of people who would otherwise be marginalized or left on the sidelines.\nAnd I know that, although we have to\u2014it's still hard to imagine exactly how we're going to get to the point where people are not just getting by but getting ahead again and staying ahead because, look, the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. We know that.\nAnd so we have to be especially focused on how we're going to bring about the changes that will ignite opportunity for everybody willing to work hard for it again.\nSo when I look at where we are as a nation and where we need to be, I see four big challenges that we have to take on together. And there are going to be fights, because they're\u2014if they were easy, they would already be done. So I will posit that right now.\nNumber one, we have to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. It needs to be innovative. It needs to be sustainable. It needs to be producing good jobs with rising wages. We need to get back into the habit of actually rewarding workers with increases in their paychecks for the increases in productivity and profitability that they have helped to bring about. [applause]\nYou know, Warren Buffett has said it, but so have a lot of other people. There's something wrong when the average American CEO makes 300 times more than the typical American worker or when hedge fund managers themselves make more and pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers.\nIn fact, I heard a statistic the other day that really made a big impact on me, that the top 25 hedge fund managers together made more money than all the kindergarten teachers in America.\nAnd when you think about value, what it is that's going to get us moving again, I think kindergarten teachers are really important. And so\u2014[laughter and applause]\u2014and we've got to make a claim on becoming the 21st century clean energy superpower. Iowa has really helped us. The RFS, the renewable fuel standard and a lot of the investments that have made here, has been one of the reasons why we have made some real progress but not near enough. And other countries are going to seize that title unless we do what we have to.\nIt's also imperative that we give people the tools through education and job training and skills not just in rhetoric but in reality so that they can make the most out of their own lives. And for me that starts at the very beginning.\nI have been a child advocate and a child development proponent for my entire adult life because it's what I really care about, what I believe in. And I think we have to start before kindergarten. We have to have universal pre-K but we also have to do more to reach out to families so they know the tools they should use to be their children's first teachers.\nNow we've got this new granddaughter who is unbelievable. And we were with her this weekend. You know, we go and just stare at her. I mean, that's what\u2014it's really\u2014it's wonderful and silly at the same time.\nBut we also read to her. Here she is, 7.5 months old, we're reading and reading and reading. And I imagine among her first words were\u2014will be, you know, \"Enough with the reading,\" because between her mom and her dad and Bill and I, we're constantly doing that.\nBut we're doing it not only because we love to do it and we love to see her begin to reach her hands out and grab onto the books, we're doing it because we know that it aids her brain development. That has been one of the great discoveries with brain research in the last couple of decades.\nWe increasingly can see what happens when you are literally feeding the brain as well as the body of these infants and then the babies and the toddlers. That will help them be better prepared when they actually end up in kindergarten and it will begin to close the achievement gap because, you know, we're going to do everything we can for our granddaughter. Charlotte will get every opportunity we can possibly imagine.\nBut what kind of country will she grow up in?\nAnd what kind of world will she enter?\nAnd what will happen to all of the other infants, babies, toddlers and children in our country today?\nSo we have to look at education from the very beginning. Then we have to make sure that we are doing all we can to empower our teachers, to make sure that they have the support of parents so that they can do the job they have been trained to do to help prepare our kids.\nAnd then we've got to make sure that college is affordable. And that cannot happen at the rate we're going unless we change the way we fund college education for young people who wish to have that experience.\nMany of us in this room, I bet, as I did, borrowed money to go to college. But then we were able to pay it back because it wasn't such an overwhelming burden as it has become now.\nThe average student in Iowa graduates with $30,000 in debt and that then makes it very difficult for them to start a business or buy a new home or even get married, as one young man told me not so long ago.\nSo we have to deal with the indebtedness to try to move toward making college as debt-free as possible. I'm 100 percent behind President Obama's proposal for free community college. We've got to try to get that through.\nAnd then we've got to try to do everything we can to make college available and affordable to all of our young people. [applause]\nYou know, when you think about our economy today, it is absolutely linked to education. It is also linked to strong families and strong communities. And that's our second challenge, because a lot of families and communities have been under tremendous strain.\nOne of the biggest stresses in anybody's life is health care. I will fight to protect the Affordable Care Act and I will work to make the changes that are required. [applause]\nWe are really now in a different world, 16 million people who didn't have health insurance who now do. We have to do everything we can to make sure that Medicare is as available and protected and affordable as possible. And we have to be sure that where there are changes that can be made we try to find ways to work across the aisle to make them.\nI don't hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talking as much as they used to about getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. I think the reason is is because there are a lot of people that they may actually be encountering from time to time who have been helped. And we need to make sure to make the argument over and over again, what will you do if you say to people we're going to take away the health care we finally have been able to provide for you? That is just unacceptable.\nBut there are some problems. You know, one of the problems\u2014and I heard about this in Iowa\u2014is what happens when a 26-year old becomes a 27-year old and is no longer eligible to be on his or her parents' policy? That was one of the best changes in the Affordable Care Act. And the fact is that a lot of young people aren't making the income they need yet to be able to afford their own health care. So we have to look out to see what we're going to be able to do to help them.\nThere are two issues that fall into this category that are huge strains on families. And I heard about them first\u2014I heard first in Davenport and I heard about it all the way across the state until I got to Council Bluffs. One is the drug epidemic\u2014meth, pills in Iowa and then I got to New Hampshire.\nAnd at my very first coffee shop meeting I heard about the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire. In the past year I've been told reliably we had more people die of drug overdoses in America than automobile accidents for the first time in our history.\nThis is tearing families apart but it is below the surface. People aren't talking about it because it's something that is hard to deal with.\nI also heard a lot about untreated mental health problems. And so many communities, so many states turning their backs on people with mental health problems. Facilities are being closed. Even though we now require there to be treatment in the Affordable Care Act, there's not enough available treatment. Not enough resources.\nThe other day, I was in California at an event. And I just said what I said. I said, you know, mental health is not being treated. We claim we're now going to be able to help people with their health care problems, but if we don't help with mental health, we're leaving out a huge number of people. And a young woman came up to me and asked me a question. She said, \"Did you know that we're having all these suicides in my high school?\" I said, \"No, I did not know that before I came.\" She goes, \"Well, we've had four young people kill themselves in the last months.\"\nThen I was in New York at an event this past way. Said the same thing that I said to you, and then I was visiting with people. And a woman come up\u2014came up to me and she goes, \"Thank you for mentioning mental health. We have gone in the last six months to four funerals of friends of my children who have killed themselves.\"\nI have to tell you, when I started running, when I started thinking about this campaign, I did not believe I would be standing in your living room talking about the drug abuse problem, the mental health problem and the suicide problem. But I am now convinced I have to talk about it. I have to do everything I can in this campaign to raise it... [applause] ...to end the stigma against talking about it.\nAnd we also have a challenge that affects everything we do, and that is to fix our dysfunctional political system. And that\u2014that underlies everything that we can possibly hope to get done. I'm very committed to meeting with anybody, going to have any conversation, to try to find common ground. But we also have to stand our ground. And we have to try to figure out how we're going to get people to work with us for the betterment of our country, the betterment of people who need a good positive support system, whether it be health care of aid for college, or anything else.\nWe also have to address the unaccountable dark money in politics. I think the supreme court made a grave error with its Citizens United decision. And I will do everything I can do to appoint supreme court justices who will protect the right to vote, and not the right of billionaires to buy elections. [applause]\nAnd, you know, I've been consulting with a lot of legal experts. and some of them think there may be a way to get legislation through that will enable us to regulate this kind of use of money in our political system which is so corruptive and corrosive. But others agree with former Justice John Paul Stevens, who recently wrote a book in which he said it's going to take a constitutional amendment. I will work for that if that's the only way to fix this problem, because we cannot continue with the kind of assault on our democracy, on voting rights, and on the opportunity for us to know where the money is coming from that influences our political system.\nNow, for us , we have challenges around the world. I was coming through the\u2014the garage, there's a TV that Dean and Gary have, and it was talking about ISIS in Iraq. We have threats that we know of. That we can begin to try to figure out how best to address. It's not just dictators. Also disease, climate change, which\u2014I think global warming is a threat to us. But we have to be confident and strong in understanding that there are many ways to approach the problems that America will be confronting in the world. And we must do so in cooperation with our friends, our allies, our fellow democracies around the world.\nI am convinced that the 21st century can once again be a century in which the United States leads and helps to set the values and the standards. But we have to have an agreement, first of all, foremost, with our own country and in our own Congress about how to do that. I was outraged, and said at the time, that when a group of Republican senators sent a letter to the ayatollah of Iran, in a\u2014essentially criticizing the actions of the president of the United States\u2014I don't care what party you are. We have one president, and we should stand behind that president when he's trying to work out very difficult problems. [applause]\nSo, I know there are a lot of hard choices ahead of us. I wrote a book called \"Hard Choices.\" There is it. There is it. I'll sign that for you. But I think we're more than up to it. You know, I am a confident optimist about where America's future lies. That doesn't mean I'm not aware of how difficult it is. I'm going into this race with my eyes wide open about how hard it is to be the president of the United States. I have a little experience about that. And I have to tell you, I find it, you know, very reassuring because I do have that experience to know what's possible and how best to proceed. but I also know that we are living in an incredibly complicated time in American history. It is not a time for easy answers or glib answers or one-liners or applause lines. Those are all great. That's part of campaigning.\nBut at the end of the day, we need a president who has both the experience and the understanding to deal with the complexity of the problems that we face. And I appreciate what both Dean and Sarah said about the experiences that I've been privileged to have during the last decades. I really believe that I can go into that office on the very first day and begin to do what is required.\nSo I look forward to visiting with each and every one of you. I look forward to working with you, not only as we move toward the caucuses. I would be honored to have your support on February 1st. And then I will need your help as we move toward the general election because I don't want this election to be about me. I want to it to be about us and the agenda that we want to set for our country.\nYou know, when I campaigned so hard against then-Senator Obama, I was, you know, working as hard as I could. He was working as hard as he could. And at the end of the day, he won. And then I went to work to make sure he got elected our president. And I was so relieved and happy when that finally happened.\nThe Sunday after the election, Bill and I went for a walk in an area that Sarah would know, a big kind of nature preserve near where we both live, and we just wanted to let down because we'd been working so hard to elect then-President-Elect Obama. So we're wandering through the woods, and Bill's phone rings, which is sort of a miracle since we have terrible cell coverage there. And he pulled it out of his pocket and it was the president-elect. And he said, \"You know, I'd like to talk to you and Hillary.\" And Bill said, \"Well, we're kind of in the middle of a forest. Can we get home and call you back?\"\nAnd so we did. And when he called back\u2014when Bill called back, he talked to the president-elect and then I talked to him. And he said to me, \"I want you to come see me in Chicago.\" And I said, \"Sure. When?\" He goes, \"As soon as you can get here.\" And I said, \"Well, OK.\" So the following Thursday, I went to Chicago and he asked me if I would serve as secretary of state.\nAnd I said, \"You know, Mr. President-elect, I, you know, I really want to go back to the Senate. I'm very flattered, but there are a lot of other people who could do that.\" \"No,\" he said. \"I know what I want and I want you to do this.\" I said, \"Well, you know, Mr. President-elect, I really want to go back to the Senate and that's where I think I can best work with you and best serve you.\" He goes, \"Look,\" he said, \"I don't want to hear from you again until you say yes.\" [laughter] So, you know, I told him \"no,\" you know, again later. And he just said, \"Don't\u2014don't call me until you say yes.\" And I did tell my husband, I said, \"He's so persistent. I've told him no twice and he keeps saying, you know, I'm waiting for you to say yes.\" And Bill said, \"Yeah, well, I asked you to marry me twice before you said yes.\" [laughter]\nSo I guess there's a connection there. So then I\u2014I stayed up that night and I\u2014I thought, you know, supposed I'd been honored to win, and I had wanted this incredibly talented American to be in my cabinet and I'd asked him, I'd want him to say yes. And I thought, you know, what's what I have to do.\nSo I called him and I said, \"You know, President-elect, I would be honored to serve in your cabinet.\" And we immediately got starting to work. A few months later, on my very first trip as secretary of state, I went to Asia. And I went in part because everybody I called, all of the leaders in the countries that I spoke with, were saying, \"You know, we just don't know whether the United States cares about us anymore; nobody's been paying any attention to us; you know, we're\u2014we're kind of feeling like we're not important to you anymore.\" I said, \"Well, you are, and the president feels that way; I feel that way; I will come see you.\"\nSo I went out. And one of the countries that I went to was Indonesia, in part because it's a very important country, but also President Obama had a personal connection with it. And my idea was not only to talk to the leaders, but to talk to the people, what's called public diplomacy. So that as you were\u2014as I was out there talking to presidents and prime ministers and others, I would also find ways of trying to connect to to tell people, \"Look, the United States really does care about the world we're trying to create together, and that's part of my message from our new president.\"\nSo I went on a\u2014I agreed to go on a show in Jakarta, which was their morning show. And it was like a combination of MTV and a reality show and all that. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. And so I go onto the set and people are jumping and they're singing and they're dancing. And it's called \"The Awesome Show.\"\nSo I'm on \"The Awesome Show,\" and I'm talking a little bit to the interviewer. And then they ask people if they have any questions. And somebody in the audience says, \"I want to ask you, we saw you campaigned very hard against President Obama; he campaigned very hard against you. He won. You lost. And then he asked you to be his secretary of state. Why?\"\nAnd I realized, you know, in a lot of these new democracies and other places of course, you run against somebody and you lose, you could get exiled or imprisoned, even killed; not asked to be secretary of state. And so this was a very legitimate question. And I thought, \"I have to answer this in a very, you know, serious way that maybe they can understand in our democracy, you know, we do try to close ranks after we have hard elections,\" at least that's what we should be doing. I said, \"Well, you're right. We campaigned hard. He won. I lost. I then campaigned to get him elected. He asked me to be secretary of state, and I said yes for the same reason: We both love our country.\"\nAnd at the end of the day to me... [applause] ...that's what elections are supposed to be about. We can disagree and we will. We'll have all kinds of arguments, even, about the best way to do things. But we should be coming from a place of love\u2014of loving our country and of respecting one another. And we have to rebuild this feeling in our country again.\nWe have too much work to be done. We have too many people who deserve a better shot at a future for themselves and their families. I want to be their champion. And with your help, I will get up every single day doing the best I can to make sure that the country we love is the country we deserve to have.\nThank you all. [applause]\n","25":"\nCLINTON: Oh, hello. Hi, how are you? Well, it's wonderful to be back in Nevada and here at Rancho. I am delighted to be joined by a number of young people who are going to talk with me and all of you about their lives, their stories, and in particular immigration.\nI want to acknowledge my friend and Congresswoman Dina Titus. Thank you so much for being here. And it is Cinco de Mayo, so that's especially appropriate day for us to be having this conversation.\nI want to begin by thanking everyone at Rancho High School for hosting us today. I'm looking forward to hearing from each of our panel participants. I have a lot of wonderful memories from my time here in Nevada. I've gone door to door meeting with families not far from the school.\nI've met with a lot of culinary workers and other workers who keep the economy going strong. I accompany the registered nurse on 12-hour shift at St. Rose Dominican Hospital and then was very pleased to go back to her home and have dinner with her and her kids.\nAnd I know how hard hits Nevadans work by the great recession. This date in particular suffered some very tough blows. There were a much higher than average home for closure rate for example, a lot of people lost their jobs or their hours or cut dramatically which made it more difficult for them to continue to make a good living.\nWe now see that this state is coming back from those top economic times. Families have found a lot of different ways to make it work for them. We also saw people once again starting businesses, thinking about sending their kids to college. Maybe doing some home repairs, maybe putting a little bit aside for retirement. But we're not yet back on our feet.\nWe have certainly climbed out of the hole we were in, but now we've got to do more than just get by. We have to get ahead and stay ahead.\nAnd there are a lot of ways that we have to think about how we do that together. I think that it's important to recognize that even with all of the hard work and sacrifices so many families made, in many ways, the deck is stacked in favor of those at the top. And I'm well aware that in Las Vegas there is nothing worse than a stacked deck.\nI want to reshuffle the deck. I want to be a champion for hard-working Americans. I want to work across party lines. I want to work with the public and the private sector. I want people to get back to the good old-fashioned American style of problem solving and setting us on back the right course.\nNow, to help reshuffle the deck, people have to do their part. They have to, you know, step up and take education seriously. They have to be willing to work hard because nothing is given to you. My dad was a small businessman and when I say that he was a really small businessman, you know, just a few day workers from time to time. My mom, my brothers and I, but he understood hard work was the path forward in the United States. He made a good living for our family and I will forever be grateful for that. Because when families are strong, America is strong. And I am convinced having thought for families going all the way back to my years in law school and ever since, there is nothing more important.\nNow in this campaign, I think we have to wage and win four big fights. One is to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. And that means we've got to be really focused on what is going to prepare young people and we have to start early. Education is the key. But education in the first years of life is essential. Because now we know that brain development really has formed by the time a child is three or four. So, we've got to do more to make sure every child has the best chance to do well in school, to get ahead, to charge his or her own future, to live up to his or her own God-given potential.\nIt's also essential that we strengthen families and communities and that's means we have to finally once and for all fix our immigration system. This is a family issue. It's an economic issue, too.\nBut it is at heart a family issue at. And if we claim that we are for families, we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system. The American people support comprehensive immigration reform, not just because it's the right thing to do, and it is, but because they know it strengthens families, strengthens our economy, and strengthens our country. That's why we can't wait any longer. We can't wait any longer for a path to fall and equal citizenship.\nNow this is where i differ with everybody on the republican side. Make no mistakes, today not a single republican candidate announced or potential is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one.\nWhen they talk about legal status, that is code for second-class status. And we should never forget who this debate is about and you're going to meet some of them in just a minute. People who work hard, who love this country, who pay taxes to it and wants nothing more than to build a good future for themselves and their children.\nWe're talking about the young people at this table. They are dreamers in much more than name. They are kids that any parents or grandparent would be proud of. And I don't understand how anyone can look at these young people and think we should break up more families, or turn away more hard workers with talent to help us build the kind of country we all want to see.\nSo, I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for your family across our country. I will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put dreamers, including those with us today, at risk of deportation. And if Congress continues to refuse to act as president, I would do everything possible under the law to go even further.\nThere are more people, like many parents have dreamers, and others, with deep ties and contributions to our communities, who deserve a chance to stay and i will fight for them.\nThe law currently allows for sympathetic cases to be reviewed but right now most of these cases have no way to get a real hearing. Therefore, we should put in place a simple, straightforward, accessible way for parents of dreamers and others with a history of service and contribution to their communities, to make their case and to be eligible for the same deferred action as their children. But that's just the beginning. There's much more to do to expand and enhance protections for families and communities to reform immigration and enforcement and detention practices, so they are more humane, targeted, and effective. And to keep building the pressure and support for comprehensive reform.\nYou know, our personal basis, the first time I ever met anyone who was in our country working was when I was about 12 years old, as I recall. And through my church, I was recruited, along with some other girls in our Sunday school class to serve as babysitters on Saturday for the small children, so the older children could join their parents in the fields because believe it or not when I was growing up in the Chicago area, it was farm field as far as the eye could see. And the migrants, immigrant laborer would come up, through the Texas up through Midwest, up to Chicago, then up to Michigan. And we were asked to try to help out.\nI remember going to the camp where the families lived and taking care of the little kids, while kids at my age were doing really hard work.\nAnd what stuck in my mind was how at the end of the day there was a long road from in the camp that went out to a kind of dirt road in the middle of the fields. And the bus that had the workers from the field down it that came back around 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon, stopped and let off the parents and the older brothers and sisters and all these little kids started running down the path to see their moms and dads and their big brothers and sisters. And they were scooped up by these really, really tired people.\nAnd I just watched this and I thought, they're just like me and my brothers. You know, when my dad comes home from work, and we go out to see him. After he has come back from his day of doing what he had to do to help support us. I've never gotten that experience to the image out of my mind.\nAnd so, for me, this is about what kind of people we are and what kind of country we have. And I am actually convinced this is in our economic interest. It's in the interest of our values and it's even in the interest of our long-term security as a nation. So, you know, where I stand. And there can be no question about it because I will do everything I can, as president, and during this campaign, to make this case.\nI know there are people who disagree with me but I want them to have a conversation with me. Because the facts are really clear. You know, we know how much people who are working hard contribute to our economy, both in what they buy and what they pay in Texas. In fact in New York, which I know a little bit about because I representative for eight years and I lived there now, our undocumented workers in New York pay more in taxes than some of the biggest corporations in New York. So, I'm ready to have this discussion with anybody, anywhere, any time.\nBut let me turn to the people who are living this story. I want you to meet them. I want you to hear from them. And I'm going to start with you, Asther , if you will introduce yourself, and talk about your own life and what brings you to the table today.\nSILVA: Thank you, secretary. My name is Asther Silva. I am currently a student at the Nevada State College pursuing my degree in history with thesis in pre-law. I arrived in United States when I was four years old. And Nevada has been my home since I was five. I came here with my mom and dad. I had a younger brother here. He is a United States citizen.\nFortunately, our family was scammed when I was very young. And because of that my father was given a deportation order. And so know, he's in order of deportation.\nCLINTON: He was scammed because you hired a lawyer to help you?\nSILVA: Yes. Well, it wasn't a lawyer. It was [inaudible] who took advantage of the fact that, you know, there was a lot of different immigration programs in the 1990s and people did not understand the differences. And so because of that, in 2001, my father was given deportation order that was not acted on until 2011. So our family in those 10 years did not know he been had that order deportation.\nRight now, thankfully, because of prior to your discussion, my dad has state of removal so he will qualify for the different action program once the lawsuit that's really an obstacle right now is moved out of the way. And my mom will who is here, she will be able to apply so that we're not afraid that she will be deported.\nCLINTON: And talk to me a little bit about what you have done in school. How you see your future. The contributions you have already made as a young person and what you would like to do further.\nSILVA: Growing up, I was really dedicated to school. My parents, they put a really big emphasis on me succeeding because of all the sacrifices they had made. They had not seen their family in 25 years.\nAnd so when I went to elementary school, middle school, I was really\u2014I was dedicated. In seventh grade, I was named the gladiator of the year at my middle school because I was the student that showed\u2014ironically the most citizenship. And so just programs like that, but I could not take advantage of them because when once I turned the age of going to college, I couldn't have a way out.\nI was afraid for many years until finally a counselor at my college, at the college at College of Southern Nevada at that time knew what was happening and helped guide me and I became involved in politics. And knowing that I didn't have to be afraid from myself because there was something, and I met other people that we're in the same situation as myself, which is something that never happened before.\nCLINTON: Erica\u2014that his mom. Part of our jobs as mom is to embarrass our children at any possible moment, but also when we're proud of them to show that pride. So, I'm happy that they're there.\nErica, how did you end up here with us today?\nERICA: I'm here to basically share my story. I came to the United States when I was two years old. My parents and I made the journey here after we lost my little sister. They basically wanted to give me a better future. I now have a 17-year-old brother. He's a U.S. citizen. And now with my parents would qualify if the lawsuit was lifted.\nI'm currently going to CFS. I want to major in political science and psychology. And I'm just here wondering what are your plans to help my community and help my family and help us not to live in fear anymore?\nCLINTON: Yes. Now that's why I think it so important that we continue to try to change the laws comprehensively. But as I have said numerous times, I support the president's action in the face of in action.\nI was personally very disappointed that when I was a senator for eight years, we had a few chances to try to do more for dreamers, do more for comprehensive immigration reform, and we were not successful.\nAnd then when I was Secretary of State, I was very pleased that there was bipartisan agreement in the Senate for comprehensive immigration reform. And it was such a good signal that Democrats and Republicans can work together, could solve a difficult problem, could put aside partisan differences. And the Senate passed it and the House of Representatives would never take it up.\nAnd I think it would have passed if they had taken it up. But I think that they\u2014the leadership in the House decided that politically they didn't want to do that because they had people who were strongly opposed to comprehensive immigration reform.\nBut I think we have to keep working on it. And that is why your stories are so important because we can't look at it as though it is some kind of abstraction. It's real people's lives and so many people who have made contributions, who have worked hard in school, who have started businesses, who have raised their children here.\nAnd as you point out in your family, you have a brother who is a U.S. citizen. So it's\u2014we have a lot of these blended families and I want to do more to make sure that Doca and Dapa and all of the changes that have occurred continue and even expand. I would like to try to do more on behalf of the parents of dreamers who are not necessarily included. But the best way is to get the comprehensive immigration reform in our Congress and try to resolve all of this.\nUNKNOWN: I'm 26 years. And I have been here since I was one year old. I graduated this summer with a degree in psychology and criminal justice. And unfortunately, when I was 15 years old, both my parents and I we received orders for deportation. And since that day we have lived in fear.\nThankfully, because of the production I have some relief, but unfortunately, I can't do the same thing from my parents. Unless the lawsuit again, stop or is dropped, my parents' future isn't secure here in United States. And as a current documented immigrant here in the United States, I stand for me with the 50,000 undocumented transgender immigrants in this country who lack resources to get any legal representation to file within the one-year Deadline for asylum.\nSo my question, Secretary Clinton, is would you lift the one-year deadline for asylum-seekers?\nCLINTON: Well, I think there's several things about that question that I'd like to answer of. One is I think that people in the immigration system should be represented. And we have made some progress on that, but not enough. And so I am in favor, particularly for young people, to have representation.\nI'd like everyone to have it. But if we have to, you know, try to prioritize, I would like young people, I would like people from vulnerable populations, who would otherwise not have the support that they need. And I don't think there's anything magic about the one-year. I think that as part of comprehensive reform, we need to look at how we make our entire system more humane.\nI also\u2014I'm very worried about detention and detention facilities for people who are vulnerable, and four children, that I think we could do a better job if we kept detention to people who have a record of violence, illegal behavior and that we have a different approach toward people who are not in that category. And I don't think we should put, you know, children and vulnerable people into big detention facilities because I think they are at risk. I think that their physical and mental health are at risk.\nSo, these are issues that we should go as far as we can to get the resources to provide support and particularly representation and change some of our detention processes within the kind of discretion that I think the president has exercised with his executive orders. But it's also clear as the president has said many times a lot of these issues can only be resolved once and for all if we have changes in the law.\nSo, I want to protect people. I want more humane treatment. No matter how the law currently is written or how it's enforced. And to put the resources behind doing that and then continue to fight for comprehensive reform. Thank you. Wanda\nUNKNOWN: Thank you, Secretary Clinton for being here and hearing our story and welcome to Nevada.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nUNKNOWN: I arrived to the United States when I was seven months old. Nevada is the only place I call home. And I grew up here. I went to school here. I graduate in University of Nevada [inaudible] with two degrees here, education as you've mentioned earlier is one of our strong points as dreamers.\nAnd because of it, I'm looking at pursuing a law degree. But, again, the system of immigration messes up my family. [inaudible] in our family.\nI come from a mixed status family. Meaning my sister is a U.S. citizen who petitioned from my father to change the legal status, and he became a legal permanent resident. When we planned to do the same for my mother, unfortunately, she faces the three tenure bar. Because of it, it was either make the decision to have her either separate our family or keep our family together. And a strong message in the immigration community is keeping our families together, and that is the path what we took.\nCLINTON: Right.\nUNKNOWN: Unfortunately, she continues to be undocumented. I have\u2014and what the president executive action, she will qualify for [inaudible], thankfully, but unfortunately with the lawsuit we\u2014it's another obstacle in the way.\nCLINTON: Wanda could you explain for people who might not know what the three and 10 rule is because it causes a lot of these issues.\nUNKNOWN: Of course. For example, my mother and I, we entered\u2014the term\u2014legal term enter by infection but we use the term the illegally. My father in his case entered with a work permit. So, he entered legally. And because of it, we faced a 3 to 10 year bar because we way we entered to our journey. We took a different way compared to my father.\nSo because of it, we face 3-10 year bar, we would have to leave our country. We tried to do it the right way undocumented community. But we had to leave the country for 3 to 10 years as a pardon for entering illegally into the country.\nCLINTON: Well, I think your example illustrates the difficulties of these rules that are applied to everybody under every circumstance without looking at the underlying situation. And you have a sister who is a citizen. You have a father who is now a legal permanent resident. You came here at seven months and you have done extremely well with your education, and you're obviously a very committed young person. And your mother, who kept the family going as moms do would have to leave for the 3 to 10-year period in order to be able to petition for reentry and therefore be determined as legal.\nThat's why I have promoted, ever since, you know, we've been having this debate, going back to when I was in the senate, a comprehensive immigration reform program, similar to what the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis, where the people who have been here and people who have as your family has, you know, contributed and worked hard, you would have, you know, pay a fine. You'd probably, you know, we'd want you to learn English which is not a problem before anybody around this table. And we would, you know, want you to, you know, get in line to get a path to citizenship but you'd be no longer at risk of being deported and you would not have to leave the country for 3 to 10 years in order to be able to try to come back in.\nSo, I think there are\u2014there's agreement among the people who supported the bipartisan bill in the Senate even though\u2014I guess some of them are paying a political price for it right now, nevertheless, it was the right thing that they may get it, it is still the right thing.\nBecause we have gained so much from people who\u2014like your families have come here and work hard and made a contribution. So, thank you for explaining that and it shows how difficult it is in so many families to be able to figure out what to do.\nAnd Juan, you have an interesting story because you are a one of those small businessmen. You know, I said the other day I wan to be the president for small business because that's where most jobs created and that's where I think the real engine of economic recovery and growth comes from. So, why don't you tell us what you've been doing?\nUNKNOWN: My name is Juan Salazar. I'm 22 years old. I came here when I was seven when I was young. I grew up here. This is all I know, the place I called home. And I'm undocumented. I struggled when I get\u2014it hit me when I got out of high school. It was hard to find a job.\nIn high school, I found my friends were getting these jobs or getting their drivers license becoming more independent. You know, I got left behind.\nBut\u2014fortunately, thanks to DACA, I was able to get a work permit and I'll tell you\u2014and I could tell us pick from all of us undocumented or immigrant. I did not take no opportunity for granted. We don't take an opportunities for granted and I feel like we don't get those a lot. And right away I went to go get my business license and\u2014to\u2014I have my own pool cleaning service. So my own company and me and my [inaudible]. And we started off with three pools. And I got my business license. I went to get certified. And, you know, to promote my name and everything.\nAnd you know, two or three years later, now, we have over 50 pools. And, you know, I am growing as to [inaudible]. I make sure that I work hard because when we didn't have anything, when my dad lost his job, when the decision hit, we lost our house. We didn't have work. We had to sell food to pay the phone bills. And, you know, I was the only going way up from there.\nAnd we're working hard every day. And, you know, I'm only learning through the struggles that we've been through, and taking it step-by-step.\nCLINTON: I'm very proud to hear your story. Of course, I mean, let's face it, you can clean pools all year round in Nevada. We have a shorter season where I live. But the fact that, you know, you and your dad really were determined to recover from losing your home, losing his job, and just doing what you had to do to be as successful as possible, is the American story.\nI mean that is what is so moving to me about what happened to you.\nUNKNOWN: Yes. And, you know, I felt\u2014at least [inaudible] for once I got the [inaudible]. I got my work's permit, but I cannot say the same thing for my parents because they don't qualify for that type of\u2014because, you know, we are all undocumented. So it was just, you know, I'm happy for the ones who were able to. But now they have a speed bump because...\nCLINTON: Right.\nUNKNOWN: ... they've got to slow down now. And I just want to make sure my parents are protected [inaudible] any minute. And I would not wish that on anybody.\nCLINTON: Right.\nUNKNOWN: Our family separated that far. So, you know, right here in Nevada, 21 percent of the business are owned by immigrants. So we are making a lot of\u2014we are moving up here and we're making a difference. All we want is work and, you know, provide for our families. And we're very united\u2014me and my family. So...\nCLINTON: That's great. Well, I think that you put an important statistic, which is nationally, not just in Nevada, so many of the new small businesses are started by immigrants. And that's something we should be celebrating, not trying to prevent or breakup, because of status differences.\nAnd also on the fact that you're so worried about your parents. I mean I will certainly try to do everything I can to, you know, avoid family breakup, avoid the kind of terrible experience that too many families have already gone through, because they were split up. And half of their family, or the breadwinner in their family, you know, picked up and gone one day.\nSo that's just\u2014it's not smart and it's not right. Do you want to share your story?\nUNKNOWN: My name is [inaudible]. I am 16 years old. I'm a junior and went to high school. It's either medical minor program. I arrived in this country at the age of two. And since then, I thank the dedication of my parents. I have been able to succeed in school. I have...\nCLINTON: Yes.\nUNKNOWN: Currently, as a junior, I continue and start to look towards my future. But once I began to look at what I have in my future, there is not a lot open. I mean, yes, think that guy could go to school, but afterwards, what is there for me? Like, I want to be a doctor. I want to go to Yale.\nCLINTON: OK.\nUNKNOWN: But, after Yale, I can't really become a doctor since my lack of [inaudible]\nCLINTON: well, I think should brag on you. You may be a junior but you have the highest grade point average in the whole class, right? And I think one of your counselors told me it was 4.8. I didn't even know they went that high.\nSo you are exactly the kind of student that every family\u2014that every community should be proud of. And the idea that you want to be a doctor is something we should be encouraging and trying to clear the path so you can go on and do that. Tell me about your family. What happened with the rest of your family?\nUNKNOWN: My\u2014both of my parents also arrived as undocumented.\nCLINTON: OK.\nUNKNOWN: So I \u2014and they were both depending on DACA. My specifically, he bright future to open up his own mechanic shop which he could be currently a mechanic. And with that, he would be able to expand his business. However, since the delay he really can't.\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's important to, you know, put faces behind the stories. Several of you have mentioned how the lawsuit tried to prevent the implementation of President Obama's executive order has really stopped the plan\u2014stopped plans for new businesses, stopped plans for going to school, or what you're going to do when you graduate just creating more uncertainty.\nAnd that is what you are describing with respect to your father. Yes. You know, I think that certainty is really important, predictability, regularization, if you will. People need to know what's going to happen. And it is just unrealistic, and I think, foolish to continue to talk as though we're going to deport 11 million or 12 million people. That is not going to happen.\nAnd so, when you accept the fact that is not going to happen...\nUNKNOWN: No.\nCLINTON: ... right? I once calculated when I was in the Senate how much money it would cost, how many buses would be required. I mean it's just, you know, it's beyond absurd. That's not going to happen. So then, what we have to do is accept the fact we are a nation of immigrants. It always have been. I think it was Franklin Roosevelt who might have said that we started off as a nation of revolutionaries and immigrants. And that has continued throughout our history.\nSo we have to solve the issues that are around this situation that we are faced with. And the facts are really clear about the contributions, the economic consumer contributions, the paying of taxes contributions, and then the young people who work hard and are looking for a place in society.\nSo I know that you each have had very personal experiences. And now is your chance to maybe say what you think should be done and how it should be done so that we have, you know, a debate that is about the realities, not about, you know, the talking points and the arguments. Esther , would you like to start?\nUNKNOWN: Well, secretary, I think one of the most important things for us is family unification. As you mentioned, 11 million people could not be deported. However, millions have already been deported.\nWe have here with us Victoria. She's also a dreamer who received DACA. She hasn't seen her mother in four years because they had to go back to Mexico for an emergency. And on the way back, her mother was unfortunately\u2014broke her leg on the journey back to the United States. And Victoria came here alone. So she's been with a guardian for the past four years.\nAnd to me, one of the questions is what will happen to those families who've already been separated? Thankfully, I go to bed every night and, you know, I live in the fear that my parents will be deported, but they're still here.\nCLINTON: Right.\nUNKNOWN: I can talk to them and I can see them. You know, and I think all of our stories have very complex issues where Juan working and his family's also makes status family all tired of it. You know, we all have siblings which two to three to 10 year bar. Our parents would qualify for adjustment. Unfortunately, that's still in place.\nSo my question is a little bit expanding on several of those issues.\nCLINTON: Yes. No, I think that reunification should be one of our goals in Comprehensive Immigration Reform because, you know, we have attempted to deal with this challenge for years now and in the absence of actually finally passing Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a lot of families have been broken up.\nAnd that's just really so painful for people who live through it, but even for those of us on the outside looking at it to even imagine what that must be like. And that's why I want to do everything we can to defend the president's executive orders because I think they were certainly within his authority. Constitutionally, legally, they were based on precedent that I believe is adequate. And then, still try to go further and deal with some of these other issues, like the reunification of families that were here and that have been split up since the last eight, 10, 12 years. Yes.\nUNKNOWN: For me, if there's 276,000 undocumented LGBT immigrants here in the United States, around 15 to 50 of them are trans. So as a lesbian woman, I'd like to know how we can protect our trans brothers and sisters from being put into institutions where they don't identify with their gender identity?\nCLINTON: Well, that's what Rafael was also referring to earlier. And look I think that we have to do more to provide safe environments for vulnerable populations. And that certainly includes the LGBT community, also includes children, and it includes unaccompanied children. There are just a\u2014there are groups of people who I think we deserve a higher level of care, because of the situations that they are finding themselves in.\nI also think that we have to reform our detention system. I've, you know, I'm not sure a lot of Americans know that a lot of the detention facilities for immigrants are run by private companies and that they have a built in incentive to fill them up, that there is actually a legal requirement that so many beds be filled. So people go out and round up people in order to get paid on a per bed basis. I mean that just makes no sense at all to me. I mean that's not the way we should be running any detention facility.\nSo I think there is a lot we have to do to change what is currently happening and to try to put us on a path toward a better, fairer, or more humane system for everybody. Yes.\nUNKNOWN: I think our court ability is a major factor. Many undocumented immigrants have been exploited. Personally, my parents were actually exploited. When they were at\u2014to this country, they had to work for $2 an hour. That was actually in 1990.\nI also think that since many of these\u2014many of our parents have actually, you know, had a work in a little wage jobs in order to, you know, to move up. I think it's also important to raise the minimum wage throughout the country and\u2014because I think people deserve to make a living wage.\nCLINTON: Yes. No, I agree with that completely. I am very much in favor of raising the minimum wage at the federal level. States and some cities are on their own raising the minimum wage. But I think there needs to be a federal floor. And I believe that the Democrats in the Senate are going to introduce legislation to do just that in the week. So I agree with you. Blanca ?\nUNKNOWN: Secretary Clinton, I think the biggest thing is, as you mentioned, you were going to keep the executive\u2014if elected president, you plan to keep the executive order. But as a down, you mentioned as well that you are going to push Congress. We look forward\u2014well, personally, and I think all of us at this table look forward to a day where we all become citizens of this country. All of us at the table have knocked doors, phoned banks to get voters out there. And we tell them our stories, because it's so important that they're vote not\u2014it's not only voting for themselves, they are voting for us and the future of this country.\nCLINTON: Right.\nUNKNOWN: So if and when elected, do you plan to push Congress as your first initiative, to push for a Comprehensive Immigration Reform?\nCLINTON: Well, it certainly be among my first initiatives. I can't\u2014sitting here today\u2014predict what will be happening. I know that happened to President Obama when he was elected and found out that we were falling into an economic abyss. And I think he deserves a lot of credit for restabilizing our situation and getting us back on the economic upswing.\nSo but among the priorities that I would be advocating for\u2014in the beginning would be Comprehensive Immigration Reform. And one of the reasons for that, in addition to everything we've discussed is as secretary of state, I saw what happens to countries that established a second-class status for people.\nThey do not feel that they belong, or they have any allegiance to the country in which they live and work because they're never fully accepted. That is a recipe for divisiveness and even for disintegration. And there fore, my view strongly is that we are a nation of immigrants. We have assimilated tens and tens of millions of people over the course of our history.\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nCLINTON: We have 11 million, 12 million people right now who are undocumented. The vast majority of whom have proven that they want to be a citizen of this country and we should put them on that path. And those who say, \"Yes, we can do reform, but not a path to citizenship,\" would be fundamentally undermining what has made America unique\u2014the way we have assimilated people, the way people who come here feel so loyal, the contributions they make.\nSo this is not just in my view the right thing to do for America. If you compare us to other countries that did not take that step, you can see what it's done to them. And I don't want to go there. So I very firmly support a path to citizenship in the context of Comprehensive Immigration Reform. Juan?\nUNKNOWN: I kind of just want to add a little personal story with what Rafael said. When I graduated high school, I realized I couldn't find any work. And my dad wasn't working as well. And we found a landscaping job, like a labor for a company. And we're actually getting paid $6 an hour where they would work us like excessively.\nAnd, you know, I was young. And I was just working really, really hard. It's been to a point where you felt like that you'd be humiliated. I remember we'd been working and that the boss was there. We could not look at him in the eye. We could not look at him, and we could not stop working. We hadn't worked harder. And even if it was lunchtime, you had to be working until he left.\nAnd, you know, I was just\u2014there's lots of stories not just like that. There's other stories that we have and I'm through that. It just felt like that and it's really hard. And, you know, me and my dad worked really hard. You know, Timber United \u2014so when he would get home from work, and I would see him limping, I don't like, you know, I don't want this for him which is kind of what motivated me to do something for us.\nCLINTON: Right.\nUNKNOWN: And, you know, he's helped me out through all his life and raised me to respect everyone and be honest and, you know, supported me with school. When we didn't have money, I'd still go part-time to see a cent. I don't know how I did it but I was going. And, you know, I just looking out for him. And we can't [inaudible] united so I'm really glad he's like my business partner.\nCLINTON: I bet he'd say the same thing about you.\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nCLINTON: But, you know, Juan, you make a good point. It's not only about the minimum wage and decent working conditions for people like you and your dad. Often times when I have conversations with people who are fearful about immigration reform, their fears are rooted in the feeling that they're losing jobs that are going to people who are undocumented.\nAnd part of that fear has a reality to it is because if people pay you $6 hour, because you're undocumented. Why would they pay somebody who already is a citizen what the minimum wage should be? So my argument is the quicker we can legalize the people who are here, the better the job market will be for everybody because you will not have a group of people who are taken advantage of and you will not have others who feel as though\u2014and to some extent it's true\u2014are losing jobs because this group that is being taken advantage of is paid so much less and treated so much worse.\nSo my argument to people who worry about Comprehensive Immigration Reform and the effect on their jobs, it's just the opposite. The sooner we can get to legalization, the better the job market will be for everybody. Then, employers will not be able to violate the laws\u2014the Wage and Hour Laws for example, because they're not dealing with a workforce that is scared to say anything, or even scared to look at the boss when he shows up on the work site.\nSo this is about everybody, not just about you and your dad.\nUNKNOWN: Yes, of course.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nUNKNOWN: I'll tell you one more question.\nCLINTON: OK.\nUNKNOWN: I just wanted to say, what do you plan\u2014well, I know here in Nevada and this county our education\u2014we keep on like lowering the education. A lot of kids aren't graduating. And I feel like we need to reach out to these kids and...\nCLINTON: Right.\nUNKNOWN: ... show them that school is very important and so is higher education. A lot of kids don't even\u2014they qualify for college\u2014there's not an\u2014maybe we need to figure out some other way. I think a lot of the reason is because of funding.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nUNKNOWN: They can't afford it and they feel discouraged and they just go on...\nCLINTON: Right.\nUNKNOWN: ... and decide not to go to school.\nCLINTON: Right. Well, look I think that that's a big part of what we have to do to make sure that out economy is competitive and also to make sure that every young person has a chance to continue their education whether it's a community college or college or a job training kind of program that will give them a good start. And you make a really strong point because it's so expensive to continue your education that too many kids are feeling\u2014and their parents are feeling it's just beyond their reach.\nSo that's why I support President Obama's proposal for free community college which at least get you started and I'd like to look to see how we get the debt under control and give people a chance to, you know, not be burdened by debt which makes it really hard for them to start a business or to continue their education.\nSo this is going to be a big part of, you know, my education policy as I go forward in the campaign because you're 100 percent right. Too many young people today feel like, you know, it's just out of their reach or they graduate with some much debt they feel like they are paralyzed. They don't know what to do. They can't buy a house, they can't get married, they can't start a business because the have so much in student debt.\nAnd, you know, then, in Iowa and in New Hampshire, you know, the average student in Iowa graduates with about $30,000 worth of debt, and then, the average student in New Hampshire, about $32,000 worth of debt. They're at the higher end. Nevada is still at the lower end of debt.\nBut, you know, you also have a lot of people who don't have that much in assets and income. So it's all, you know, relative to what they can afford. So we have to do more on that. And I want to put in a big plug before we give you the last word about Rancho because I learned today that this school uses Title I funds to pay for the A.P. exam fee. This is, you know, this sounds a little archane but I want to emphasize how important this is because when you look at high school education, making it possible for more students to have access to advanced placement courses really ups the level of education.\nIt gives kids a leg up if they go on to college because they may have some credit before they ever get there. But too many kids in the past and still across our country don't take the test because\u2014I don't know what it does today\u2014$80?\nUNKNOWN: $85.\nCLINTON: $85. That's a lot of money if, you know, you're making minimum wage or less. So I want to\u2014I really want to\u2014I don't\u2014I hope that the Rancho administrators are still here because\u2014good. The principal is still here. I want to give them a big shout out for using Title I funding to make sure every kid who wants to take an A.P. course gets to and gets to take the exam.\nSo I'm sure, you're going to do some of that next year. [crosstalk] Currently. You have them tomorrow?\nUNKNOWN: I had my Chemistry test Monday and I have my Statistics and English Language next Monday.\nCLINTON: So you're taking three A.P. exams as a junior?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nCLINTON: Wow. Wow. OK.\nUNKNOWN: [inaudible] to education topic?\nCLINTON: Sure.\nUNKNOWN: Once DACA was brought open\u2014established, it opened doors for many like myself to school to try Yale, Harvard, et cetera. But oftentimes, the journey ends there and I was wondering if or what was your position or what will you offer in order for us to be able to continue on to our education and become or raised doctors, so on and so forth.\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's very shortsighted of us not to legalize students who graduate from college and can use their skills to make a good life for themselves but also to give back. We have thousands and thousands of foreign students come to our country every year. And they get a great education in our colleges and universities. And then, a lot of them stay.\nWell, I want you to be a doctor if that's what you want to be. I mean you've come up to our system, you've worked hard, and then you've done exceptionally well. So I think this is the particular fix in addition to the other fixes we've been talking about.\nYou know, I read an article recently about a group of young, undocumented men who were really interested in technology and they entered a contest against kids from the best schools and companies and they won. And so, you have four kids who beat the best of the best. And they couldn't do anything because they were undocumented.\nAnd I am sitting there thinking, \"What is wrong with this picture?\" We are in a global competition and I intend for us to win it. And I'm about to let anybody who can make a contribution to our economy and our society get thrown away.\nSo from my perspective we need to fix that, we need to remove the fear, and we need to make sure that we give every child a chance to do the best that he or she can. And if that means going to Yale and becoming a doctor I want that to happen.\nSo, as you can tell, I could be here all day because, you know, six exceptional young people, we have some proud parents and grandparents and teachers here.\nBut let me and where I started thanking Rancho for having me here, thanking each of you for being willing and brave enough to sit here and talk about your own lives. I want to reiterate my strong support for the president's executive actions because he had to act in the face of inaction that was not on the merits but politically motivated for partisan reasons which I think is not the way we should be solving our problems in our country, in our Congress or anywhere else.\nAnd I'm so pleased that the congresswoman is here because I know she's a champion for a lot of the issues that we are talking about today. And I want to get back to good old-fashioned problem-solving. And this is one of the problems we have to solve together.\nSo I pledge to you I will do everything I possibly can to make this an issue in the campaign but more importantly, when I'm president, to put it on the top of my priority list.\nSo if you'll stay here, we're going to do a picture. And maybe we could get the Rancho\u2014the principal and others to come up and join us, you know. Yes. Let's get the administrators who invited us all here to come and stand. If you'll just stand with us we will get a picture with everybody. Congresswoman, why don't you join us?\n[crosstalk]\nWrite me a memo about what I need to do differently. Yes, you want to come around?\nUNKNOWN: What if everybody stand up?\nCLINTON: OK. We stand up? That's good. Excellent.\nUNKNOWN: OK.\nCome closer.\nCLINTON: OK. Come closer. Give me that. And Juan, you're going to give me that. That's great.\n[crosstalk]\nUNKNOWN: Say cheese.\nCLINTON: Yes, look at Barb and then we'll look at all the very proud parents with their cameras.\nUNKNOWN: OK.\nCLINTON: OK. So we'll look over here. OK, got some cameras over here. It's like when you're on the red carpet and they yell at you. \"Look here\".\nOK. Thank you. Great. You want to come around? OK. Good to meet you, Chris.\nUNKNOWN: Good to meet you. Thank you so much.\nCLINTON: I'm so happy I could. Thank you so much.\nUNKNOWN: I'm very grateful.\nCLINTON: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Is your name Barbara ?\nUNKNOWN: Barb.\nEveryone call her Barb.\nCLINTON: Barb.\nUNKNOWN: Thank you.\nAnd just so you know, my mom write to you like everywhere. [inaudible] friendly.\nCLINTON: Good.\nUNKNOWN: [inaudible] go away and you should call it Hillary until [inaudible] Hillary is...\nCLINTON: I love that.\nUNKNOWN: Right. It's nice.\nCLINTON: Here you go.\n[crosstalk]\n","26":"\nThank you so much. I am absolutely delighted to be back here at Columbia. I want to thank President Bollinger, Dean Janow, and everyone at the School of International and Public Affairs. It is a special treat to be here with and on behalf of a great leader of this city and our country, David Dinkins. He has made such an indelible impact on New York, and I had the great privilege of working with him as First Lady and then, of course, as a new senator.\nWhen I was just starting out as a senator, David's door was always open. He and his wonderful wife Joyce were great friends and supporters and good sounding boards about ideas that we wanted to consider to enhance the quality of life and the opportunities for the people of this city. I was pleased to address the Dinkins Leadership and Public Policy Forum in my first year as a senator, and I so appreciated then as I have in the years since David's generosity with his time and most of all his wisdom. So 14 years later, I'm honored to have this chance, once again, to help celebrate the legacy of one of New York's greatest public servants.\nI'm pleased too that you will have the opportunity after my remarks to hear from such a distinguished panel, to go into more detail about some of the issues that we face. I also know that Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer is here, along with other local and community leaders.\nBecause surely this is a time when our collective efforts to devise approaches to the problems that still afflict us is more important than ever. Indeed, it is a time for wisdom.\nFor yet again, the family of a young black man is grieving a life cut short.\nYet again, the streets of an American city are marred by violence. By shattered glass and shouts of anger and shows of force.\nYet again a community is reeling, its fault lines laid bare and its bonds of trust and respect frayed.\nYet again, brave police officers have been attacked in the line of duty.\nWhat we've seen in Baltimore should, indeed does, tear at our soul.\nAnd, from Ferguson to Staten Island to Baltimore, the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable.\nWalter Scott shot in the back in Charleston, South Carolina. Unarmed. In debt. And terrified of spending more time in jail for child support payments he couldn't afford.\nTamir Rice shot in a park in Cleveland, Ohio. Unarmed and just 12 years old.\nEric Garner choked to death after being stopped for selling cigarettes on the streets of this city.\nAnd now Freddie Gray. His spine nearly severed while in police custody.\nNot only as a mother and a grandmother but as a citizen, a human being, my heart breaks for these young men and their families.\nWe have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America.\nThere is something profoundly wrong when African American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts.\nThere is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes. And an estimated 1.5 million black men are \"missing\" from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature death.\nThere is something wrong when more than one out of every three young black men in Baltimore can't find a job.\nThere is something wrong when trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve breaks down as far as it has in many of our communities.\nWe have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance. And these recent tragedies should galvanize us to come together as a nation to find our balance again.\nWe should begin by heeding the pleas of Freddie Gray's family for peace and unity, echoing the families of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and others in the past years.\nThose who are instigating further violence in Baltimore are disrespecting the Gray family and the entire community. They are compounding the tragedy of Freddie Gray's death and setting back the cause of justice. So the violence has to stop.\nBut more broadly, let's remember that everyone in every community benefits when there is respect for the law and when everyone in every community is respected by the law. That is what we have to work towards in Baltimore and across our country.\nWe must urgently begin to rebuild the bonds of trust and respect among Americans. Between police and citizens, yes, but also across society.\nRestoring trust in our politics, our press, our markets. Between and among neighbors and even people with whom we disagree politically.\nThis is so fundamental to who we are as a nation and everything we want to achieve together.\nIt truly is about how we treat each other and what we value. Making it possible for every American to reach his or her God-given potential\u2014regardless of who you are, where you were born, or who you love.\nThe inequities that persist in our justice system undermine this shared vision of what America can be and should be.\nI learned this firsthand as a young attorney just out of law school\u2014at one of those law schools that will remain nameless here at Columbia. One of my earliest jobs for the Children's Defense Fund, which David had mentioned\u2014I was so fortunate to work with Marian Wright Edelman as a young lawyer and then serving on the board of the Children's Defense Fund\u2014was studying the problem then of youth, teenagers, sometimes preteens, incarcerated in adult jails. Then, as director of the University of Arkansas School of Law's legal aid clinic, I advocated on behalf of prison inmates and poor families.\nI saw repeatedly how our legal system can be and all too often is stacked against those who have the least power, who are the most vulnerable.\nI saw how families could be and were torn apart by excessive incarceration. I saw the toll on children growing up in homes shattered by poverty and prison.\nSo, unfortunately, I know these are not new challenges by any means.\nIn fact they have become even more complex and urgent over time. And today they demand fresh thinking and bold action from all of us.\nToday there seems to be a growing bipartisan movement for commonsense reforms in our criminal justice systems. Senators as disparate on the political spectrum as Cory Booker and Rand Paul and Dick Durbin and Mike Lee are reaching across the aisle to find ways to work together. It is rare to see Democrats and Republicans agree on anything today. But we're beginning to agreeing on this: We need to restore balance to our criminal justice system.\nNow of course it is not enough just to agree and give speeches about it\u2014we actually have to work together to get the job done.\nWe need to deliver real reforms that can be felt on our streets, in our courthouses, and our jails and prisons, in communities too long neglected.\nLet me touch on two areas in particular where I believe we need to push for more progress.\nFirst, we need smart strategies to fight crime that help restore trust between law enforcement and our communities, especially communities of color.\nThere's a lot of good work to build on. Across the country, there are so many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, honorably doing their duty, putting themselves on the line to save lives. There are police departments already deploying creative and effective strategies, demonstrating how we can protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force. We need to learn from those examples, build on what works.\nWe can start by making sure that federal funds for state and local law enforcement are used to bolster best practices, rather than to buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets.\nPresident Obama's task force on policing gives us a good place to start. Its recommendations offer a roadmap for reform, from training to technology, guided by more and better data.\nWe should make sure every police department in the country has body cameras to record interactions between officers on patrol and suspects.\nThat will improve transparency and accountability, it will help protect good people on both sides of the lens. For every tragedy caught on tape, there surely have been many more that remained invisible. Not every problem can be or will be prevented with cameras, but this is a commonsense step we should take.\nThe President has provided the idea of matching funds to state and local governments investing in body cameras. We should go even further and make this the norm everywhere.\nAnd we should listen to law enforcement leaders who are calling for a renewed focus on working with communities to prevent crime, rather than measuring success just by the number of arrests or convictions.\nAs your Senator from New York, I supported a greater emphasis on community policing, along with putting more officers on the street to get to know those communities.\nDavid Dinkins was an early pioneer of this policy. His leadership helped lay the foundation for dramatic drops in crime in the years that followed.\nAnd today smart policing in communities that builds relationships, partnerships, and trust makes more sense than ever.\nAnd it shouldn't be limited just to officers on the beat. It's an ethic that should extend throughout our criminal justice system. To prosecutors and parole officers. To judges and lawmakers.\nWe all share a responsibility to help re-stitch the fabric of our neighborhoods and communities.\nWe also have to be honest about the gaps that exist across our country, the inequality that stalks our streets. Because you cannot talk about smart policing and reforming the criminal justice system if you also don't talk about what's needed to provide economic opportunity, better educational chances for young people, more support to families so they can do the best jobs they are capable of doing to help support their own children.\nToday I saw an article on the front page of USA Today that really struck me, written by a journalist who lives in Baltimore. And here's what I read three times to make sure I was reading correctly: \"At a conference in 2013 at Johns Hopkins University, Vice Provost Jonathan Bagger pointed out that 'only six miles separate the Baltimore neighborhoods of Roland Park and Hollins Market. But there is a 20-year difference in the average life expectancy.'\"\nWe have learned in the last few years that life expectancy, which is a measure of the quality of life in communities and countries, manifests the same inequality that we see in so many other parts of our society.\nWomen\u2014white women without high school education\u2014are losing life expectancy. Black men and black women are seeing their life expectancy goes down in so many parts of our country.\nThis may not grab headlines, although I was glad to see it on the front page of USA Today. But it tells us more than I think we can bear about what we are up against.\nWe need to start understanding how important it is to care for every single child as though that child were our own.\nDavid and I started our conversation this morning talking about our grandchildren; now his are considerably older than mine. But it was not just two longtime friends catching up with each other. It was so clearly sharing what is most important to us, as it is to families everywhere in our country.\nSo I don't want the discussion about criminal justice, smart policing, to be siloed and to permit discussions and arguments and debates about it to only talk about that. The conversation needs to be much broader. Because that is a symptom, not a cause, of what ails us today.\nThe second area where we need to chart a new course is how we approach punishment and prison.\nIt's a stark fact that the United States has less than 5 percent of the world's population, yet we have almost 25 percent of the world's total prison population. The numbers today are much higher than they were 30, 40 years ago, despite the fact that crime is at historic lows.\nOf the more than 2 million Americans incarcerated today, a significant percentage are low-level offenders: people held for violating parole or minor drug crimes, or who are simply awaiting trial in backlogged courts.\nKeeping them behind bars does little to reduce crime. But it is does a lot to tear apart families and communities.\nOne in every 28 children now has a parent in prison. Think about what that means for those children.\nWhen we talk about one and a half million missing African American men, we're talking about missing husbands, missing fathers, missing brothers.\nThey're not there to look after their children or bring home a paycheck. And the consequences are profound.\nWithout the mass incarceration that we currently practice, millions fewer people would be living in poverty.\nAnd it's not just families trying to stay afloat with one parent behind bars. Of the 600,000 prisoners who reenter society each year, roughly 60 percent face long-term unemployment.\nAnd for all this, taxpayers are paying about $80 billion a year to keep so many people in prison.\nThe price of incarcerating a single inmate is often more than $30,000 per year\u2014and up to $60,000 in some states. That's the salary of a teacher or police officer.\nOne year in a New Jersey state prison costs $44,000\u2014more than the annual tuition at Princeton.\nIf the United States brought our correctional expenditures back in line with where they were several decades ago, we'd save an estimated $28 billion a year. And I believe we would not be less safe. You can pay a lot of police officers and nurses and others with $28 billion to help us deal with the pipeline issues.\nIt's time to change our approach. It's time to end the era of mass incarceration. We need a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe.\nI don't know all the answers. That's why I'm here\u2014to ask all the smart people in Columbia and New York to start thinking this through with me. I know we should work together to pursue together to pursue alternative punishments for low-level offenders. They do have to be in some way registered in the criminal justice system, but we don't want that to be a fast track to long-term criminal activity, we don't want to create another \"incarceration generation.\"\nI've been encouraged to see changes that I supported as Senator to reduce the unjust federal sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine crimes finally become law.\nAnd last year, the Sentencing Commission reduced recommended prison terms for some drug crimes.\nPresident Obama and former Attorney General Holder have led the way with important additional steps. And I am looking forward to our new Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, carrying this work forward.\nThere are other measures that I and so many others have championed to reform arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences are long overdue.\nWe also need probation and drug diversion programs to deal swiftly with violations, while allowing low-level offenders who stay clean and stay out of trouble to stay out of prison. I've seen the positive effects of specialized drug courts and juvenile programs work to the betterment of individuals and communities. And please, please, let us put mental health back at the top of our national agenda.\nYou and I know that the promise of de-institutionalizing those in mental health facilities was supposed to be followed by the creation of community-based treatment centers. Well, we got half of that equation\u2014but not the other half. Our prisons and our jails are now our mental health institutions.\nI have to tell you I was somewhat surprised in both Iowa and New Hampshire to be asked so many questions about mental health. \"What are we going to do with people who need help for substance abuse or mental illness?\" \"What are we going to do when the remaining facilities are being shut down for budget reasons?\" \"What are we going to do when hospitals don't really get reimbursed for providing the kind of emergency care that is needed for mental health patients?\"\nIt's not just a problem in our cities. There's a quiet epidemic of substance abuse sweeping small-town and rural America as well. We have to do more and finally get serious about treatment.\nI'll be talking about all of this in the months to come, offering new solutions to protect and strengthen our families and communities.\nI know in a time when we're afflicted by short-termism, we're not looking over the horizon for the investments that we need to make in our fellow citizens, in our children. So I'm well aware that progress will not be easy, despite the emerging bipartisan consensus for certain reforms. And that we will have to overcome deep divisions and try to begin to replenish our depleted reservoirs of trust.\nBut I am convinced, as the congenital optimist I must be to live my life, that we can rise to this challenge. We can heal our wounds. We can restore balance to our justice system and respect in our communities. And we can make sure that we take actions that are going to make a difference in the lives of those who for too long have been marginalized and forgotten.\nLet's protect the rights of all our people. Let's take on the broader inequities in our society. We can't separate out the unrest we see in the streets from the cycles of poverty and despair that hollow out those neighborhoods.\nDespite all the progress we've made in this country lifting people up\u2014and it has been extraordinary\u2014too many of our fellow citizens are still left out.\nTwenty-five years ago, in his inaugural address as Mayor, David Dinkins warned of leaving \"too many lost amidst the wealth and grandeur that surrounds us.\"\nToday, his words and the emotion behind them ring truer than ever. You don't have to look too far from this magnificent hall to find children still living in poverty or trapped in failing schools. Families who work hard but can't afford the rising prices in their neighborhood.\nMothers and fathers who fear for their sons' safety when they go off to school\u2014or just to go buy a pack of Skittles.\nThese challenges are all woven together. And they all must be tackled together.\nOur goal must truly be inclusive and lasting prosperity that's measured by how many families get ahead and stay ahead...\nHow many children climb out of poverty and stay out of prison...\nHow many young people can go to college without breaking the bank...\nHow many new immigrants can start small businesses ...\nHow many parents can get good jobs that allow them to balance the demands of work and family.\nThat's how we should measure prosperity. With all due respect, that is a far better measurement than the size of the bonuses handed out in downtown office buildings.\nNow even in the most painful times like those we are seeing in Baltimore ...\nWhen parents fear for their children...\nWhen smoke fills the skies above our cities...\nWhen police officers are assaulted...\nEven then\u2014especially then\u2014let's remember the aspirations and values that unite us all: That every person should have the opportunity to succeed. That no one is disposable. That every life matters.\nSo yes, Mayor Dinkins. This is a time for wisdom.\nA time for honesty about race and justice in America.\nAnd, yes, a time for reform.\nDavid Dinkins is a leader we can look to. We know what he stood for. Let us take the challenge and example he presents and think about what we must do to make sure that this country we love\u2014this city we live in\u2014are both good and great.\nAnd please join me in saying a prayer for the family of Freddie Gray, and all the men whose names we know and those we don't who have lost their lives unnecessarily and tragically. And in particular today, include in that prayer the people of Baltimore and our beloved country.\nThank you all very much.\n","27":"\nClinton: Well, thank you all so much for inviting me here today and giving me a chance to not only learn more about this business, which is a family business, 112 years young.\nUnknown: That's right.\nClinton: And to meet some of the people who work here, as I did when I was walking through, and as you've just introduced yourself. I am excited to hear from you about what it takes to get a small business up and going and keep it growing in an increasingly competitive global economy.\nSmall business is the backbone of the American economy. Here in New Hampshire, 96 percent of all businesses are considered small businesses. And they employ more than half of the workers, the employees, in the state of New Hampshire. So New Hampshire is a perfect example of what it takes to start and grow a small business.\nAnd I come from a small business family. My father had a very small business. He printed drapery fabrics in a print plant. And he did much of the work himself, sometimes with day laborers, sometimes with my mother and my brothers and me, literally, taking the squeegee, pour the paint on the silk screen. You take the squeegee, you go down, then you lift it up and you go to the next and you keep going.\nAnd I saw where now there's a machine that you just bought that's printing on all kinds of material. And I'm thinking back to those years in my father's small print plant. But he made a very good living because of his hard work and his absolute willingness to do whatever it took to design, to produce, to sell the products that were at the heart of what he produced.\nAnd so from my perspective, I want to be sure that we get small businesses starting and growing in America again. We have stalled out. I was very surprised to see that when I began to dig into it, because people were telling me this, as I traveled around the country the last two years, but I didn't know what they were saying.\nAnd it turns out that we're not producing as many small businesses as we used to. And a recent world study said that we are 46th in the world in the difficulty to start a small business. There are lots of issues and we'll get into some of those, I hope, Dave, and the rest of you, as well.\nSo I want to hear from each of you, because part of what I'm doing in this campaign is making my own decisions about what we need to do. I want to embed what I propose as policies, not in ideology, not in some philosophy, but in the real daily lives and experiences of American workers and business owners and everybody who had a stake in making sure that the economy is working again. Really, we have to do more for young people, because what we're finding is that with student debt \u2014 and New Hampshire has the highest student debt numbers of any state in the country \u2014 that interferes with the young people taking certain jobs, buying a house, even getting married and certainly starting a business.\nWhen I was in Iowa last week, I met a young man, who \u2014 his dream had been to own a bowling center is his hometown. He graduated from college, because he'd worked, like you, during the summers, and he \u2014 and he wanted to own that business. He got a chance to do it.\nWith his student debt, it was really a struggle, because even though he was very responsible, he had done everything we expect a young person to do to try to better himself, he was running into real credit problems.\nAnd even now, he's got the business, but he runs it \u2014 he has a little grill and restaurant, he, with two employees, is trying to make a go of it. Here's a young, ambitious guy. And when I think about my dad, it was a lot easier in those days to have an idea, to get what you needed and to go to work.\nThe other piece of this, as we were walking around and Dave was telling about all of the incredible machines that are used here in production, all but one are from another country. And many of them, if I'm right, Dave, are from Europe.\nUnknown: That's correct.\nClinton: And so you think \u2014 I mean, Europe has high wages. They have high costs. Why are they producing these advanced machines instead of us? What's wrong with this picture?\nYou can \u2014 you can see that maybe lower-cost places that are mastering the art of machine production would be competitive, but these are high-value machines. These are very sophisticated machines.\nHow do we get that into more basic production again so that we can resume our lead in manufacturing, something that I think is essential? A lot of people disagree with me. They say, \"Oh, you know, those days are over.\" I don't believe it.\nYou walk around here, you see these machines from, you know, Italy or Germany or wherever else they're from. Why? Why aren't we producing those machines? What do we need to do to jump-start advanced manufacturing once again in our country?\nSo my bottom line is, we've gone through some tough times, and I think Americans have done everything they could think of to do to get through those tough times.\nBut now it's not enough just to tread water; we need to get ahead and stay ahead, and people need to feel that their work is being rewarded, that the deck is not stacked in favor of those at the top, that they too have a chance to go as far as their hard work and their aspiration will take them.\nSo in order to put together a set of policies for my campaign, I really want to make sure that they are in line with the real lives and the real working experiences of the people that I would love to represent as your president.\nSo we're going to take on four big fights. You know, we're going to fight to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday, and make the middle class mean something again in this country. We're going to fight to have strong families and strong communities. And of course, it's no accident that I'm at a [inaudible] whose customer market is between six months and six years. That's \u2014 that's right where I am focused these days.\nI want to make sure we have a functioning political system. I'm going to fight for that.\nI will work with anybody. I've done that. I did it as senator. I will do it again.\nBut I will also stand my ground when we need to, and part of that is getting unaccountable money out of politics, because we cannot afford that, even if it takes a constitutional amendment.\nAnd then finally, we always have to be vigilant to protect our country against the threats we know \u2014 we can see them \u2014 but then the threats we can't see \u2014 pandemic diseases, cyber warfare, et cetera.\nSo I'm excited about this campaign. I'm thrilled to be back in New Hampshire. I see some of my friends out there in the audience.\nAnd the first place I ever came for any political campaign was in 1991 when I was here campaigning for my husband, in October of 1991. I celebrated my birthday here in \u2014 in Keene, and I have a lot of wonderful memories.\nSo with that, Dave, I'm going to turn it back to you, and \u2014 and we can start hearing from some of the folks.\nQuestion: I think maybe I'll ask the initial question, and you guys will chime in.\nBut \u2014 but, you know, early childhood is obviously our interest and \u2014 our selfish interest, but also, we're fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters. And I would like you to elaborate on exactly what you think you might do for child-care in the future if \u2014 if you're \u2014 you know, if you're elected.\nClinton: Well, that's a question near and dear to my heart, because I think every society starts with our youngest citizens. And when I got out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. And so my whole adult life, both professionally and my volunteer work, has been around children and families and it is to me the most important commitment we can make.\nAnd now it's not only that we want to take care of our children and our grandchildren, but we now know that the way brains develop, thanks to all the great research that is being done by our scientists, that those early years really are critical to the success that a child will have in school and what that child can learn and then what that child can choose to do, what kind of opportunities will be available.\nSo I think we have to start in the family. And I've been working on a project to convince parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, to read, talk and sing to their babies and that's equally important in any child care setting.\nSo when you are producing furniture that give kids a chance to be part of a circle, to work on a table, all of that, it's safety and stimulation are the two most important needs that little, tiny babies have. And I think we need a much more broadly based universal pre- Kindergarten program so that kids have a chance to get ready for school.\nAnd I really applaud states \u2014 and they are not \u2014 you know, they're not all the states that you might think of \u2014 Oklahoma has a universal pre-K program because their state decided they would invest in those early years to get their kids better for school.\nAnd I think the child care problem, I was looking at a statistic that it can cost as much as $12,000 a year in New Hampshire for quality child care. That's more than the community college costs, as I understand it.\nAnd what are we going to do about that?\nHow can you expect, you know, most families to afford that kind of cost?\nSo we've got to do more to support quality child care and universal pre-kindergarten because by the time a child enters kindergarten, a lot of their brain development has taken place, their vocabulary has been developed and so if we want to do well in school \u2014 and I know there's a couple teachers or retired teachers out there, you want to have our kids do well in school, it has to start in those first five years and that's where you come in.\nAnd you were telling me about a light table and other things that you prepare for settings where little kids are \u2014 that's all to stimulate them and give them a chance to develop that brain and learn more so they are better prepared for school.\nQuestion: Yes. Thank you.\nGuys, you want to start off, anybody?\nQuestion: Well, my grandson goes to the Head Start across the way over there [inaubible] in there it's filled with Whitney Brothers products, all down the hallways. They're all on coat lockers. In there are all their \u2014 are little tables and chairs. And it made me feel so proud that I worked here, that these people were buying [inaubible].\n[audio gap]\nQuestion: \u2014 more for substance abuse, help in our area, there's very limited resources here. And we would like to see something in that respect.\nDo you have \u2014\nClinton: Well \u2014 Question: \u2014 any further ideas?\nClinton: I do, actually. I am \u2014 I'm really concerned because, Pam, what you just told me, I'm hearing from a lot of different people. There is a hidden epidemic. You know, the drug abuse problem, whether it's pills or meth or heroin, is not as visible as in, you know, 30 years ago when there were all kinds of gangs and violence. This is a quiet epidemic. And it is striking in small towns and rural areas as much as any big city. And at the same time, we see steady cutbacks in drug abuse programs, treatment programs, mental health programs. I see Senator Kelly here and I know how committed she is to trying to get resources.\nSo we're \u2014 we've got a perfect storm. We have an increasing problem that's only beginning to break through the service so that people \u2014 you know, I think a lot of people are thinking, well, that's somebody else's problem, it's not my problem and indeed it is all of our problem. And we don't have enough resources, so that if somebody decides that they want to get help, where do you send them?\nWhat kind of opportunities do they have for treatment?\nAnd I am convinced that the mental health issues \u2014 because I consider substance abuse part of mental health issues \u2014 is going to be a big part of my campaign because increasingly it's a big issue that people raised with me.\nAnd when I was in Iowa last week, I literally heard from one end of the state, from Davenport to Council Bluffs, about this problem and how the state was shutting all their inpatient facilities and there was nowhere for people to be sent.\nSo we've got to do more. We have treatment in the Affordable Care Act, which is a good thing, which we \u2014 and we have at least on paper, what's called mental health parity, you know, insurance companies have to care of mental health just like they take care of physical problems.\nBut we are just at the beginning of trying to figure out what this is, and the whole substance abuse issue \u2014 I'll just end with this. You probably have read about this small county in Southern Indiana where there was an epidemic of HIV among just people living in the community because they were sharing needles and shooting up some kind of pill that was I guess turned to powder.\nSo now they have not only the drug abuse problem, they have people who contracted HIV. So this is not something we can just brush under the rug and wish it would go away. We need a concerted policy, national, state, local, public, private and we need to try to help young people like the mother of your grandson.\nQuestion: Thank you.\nQuestion: Well, the drug issue is not really a no-issue here. I mean, as a kid myself, as the son of a minister, of a preacher, the little town that I grew up in, I was the only kid my age who was not involved in drugs of some sort. The dealer lived across the street, the kids used their drugs in the front lawn of the house next door. I mean \u2014 and there was no \u2014 really no recourse in upstate New York at that time because this little town of 300,000 acres, one town cop, two local sheriffs, that's a lot of territory to cover.\nSo it's not really a no issue but it is certainly an ongoing issue.\nClinton: You know, that's exactly right. It's not a new issue, but it's taken a new \u2014 kind of a new turn, if you will. And I think more young people \u2014 maybe because we stopped the messaging about how dangerous drugs work, because I can remember the same kind of, you know, messages advertising that we would see all the time, you don't see that anymore.\nAnd so I think for a lot of young people, especially if it's pills, I think they believe, well, what's wrong with that? I mean, you know it's a prescription pill so that means it must be OK. And they don't know that taking it and mixing it and all the rest is going to be dangerous for them. That's a good point. Yes.\nQuestion: Bill?\nQuestion: Well, I was in the line with the drugs and things, you made a point that educating the kids at an early age, it might be advantageous to really push the drug issue there at Head Start, you know, just in a \u2014 in a way that they'll understand it, no, it's not a good thing to do, even though your friends might do it. You don't need to do this. You don't have to. There's other ways.\nClinton: Yes, so starting early.\nQuestion: Start it early.\nClinton: And, Chris, you hire a lot of people, so you see this, don't you and \u2014\nQuestion: Yes. Whitney Brothers actually does drug testing. It's a pre-employment drug testing in order to come to work here, so we want a drug-free workplace.\nClinton: Well, I think that sends a strong message and a lot of employers are either doing that or thinking about that going back to doing it, from what I'm hearing.\nIs that what you hear from your human resource contacts as well?\nQuestion: Yes. And Workmen's Comp likes having it, too, because we haven't [inaubible] machines that people are running and if they're high, running them and obviously there's going to be \u2014 someone's going to get hurt.\nCoordination and everything goes downhill.\nClinton: Yes.\nWhat are some of the other issues?\nJim, like, what's on your mind economically and kind of how you see things for yourself and your family?\nQuestion: Well, thank you. Because my kids are all grown and they're in their late 20s so they're \u2014 have established themselves and they're doing their thing, so I don't have to worry about them anymore in the way I used to with young kids. But for myself, I'm getting, you know, up in age and looking for \u2014 I've worked for small companies all my life. And most of them have just enough money to give you minimal health care, to, you know, retirement. I have very little saved for retirement because of you know, trying to make ends meet with kids and you know, it's [inaubible] the resources. And the company I just left before I came here a year ago closed their doors because of the economy \u2014 they were \u2014 they were making super insulated panels for the building industry, which I thought was the way to go.\nAnd so when they closed their doors, I was 27 years working for them, left me with \u2014 looking for a new job and thankfully [inaubible] you know, Whitney Brothers were looking for my skills to help them with their products and I'm very thankful for being here.\nBut you know, I look at, you know, hope your ideas on health care and Social Security and you know, where are those \u2014 where are those heading? [inaubible] probably I'm in my late 50s right now and you know, 10 years from now I'm going to hopefully work less. You know, what's going to \u2014 you know, and so, in regards to our company here, [inaubible], what could be done to help you know, bolster our company here to help us all live a little better life?\nClinton: Can I ask you, you worked for 27 years.\nWas there any kind of retirement account, kind of [inaubible] 401(k), anything?\nQuestion: There was initially; that lasted until the economy went belly up back in 2008. And you know, our company went right down the tubes. So it was, you know, people weren't going to, you know, to spend that extra little bit of money to get a better \u2014 a better product.\nAnd you know, the same what happens here. I mean, we're struggling to try to fight with, you know, the Chinese and other people who are making similar items to us and are, you know, cutting costs and we're, you know, we look at every penny that we put into the \u2014 into our products here and try to you know, get everything out of it we can with the CSN machines, with the \u2014 with the processes that we use.\nSo, yes, the company I work for was \u2014 I always thought was the way to go.\nClinton: Well, you know, you really raised an important issue because one of the really big problems we face is that American worker productivity has continued to go up. American workers work longer and harder and more productively than the vast majority of workers anywhere in the world.\nBut it's been very difficult to turn that increased productivity into increased wages and increased benefits. And in some cases, where you have small companies, it's\u2014 the margin's just too thin. You know, it's really hard to do that. In some places where you have big companies, they just choose not to. They'd rather stock buybacks than increase the, you know, the wages and salaries of the people who've actually contributed to the productivity and the profits.\nSo I think there has to be a look at the range of different kinds of companies because some companies have the cash and they make decisions that leave out their workers and some people are trying just to keep the doors open and the work coming and be successful and stay afloat.\nSo what we need to figure out is how we incentivize companies that have the cash to do more with it and how we support smaller businesses to be more competitive, to get more market, especially export market.\nAnd Dave and I were talking about how important it is for small businesses to have access to market openings. I mean, how do you get the best support you need for a website or for you know, telling other potential customers about your product?\nHow do you compete with, as you say, somebody doing the same thing in China?\nSo I think we have to look at this from kind of the top and the middle and try to figure out what's the best way to do it.\nOn Social Security, though, you know, there is a lot of loose talk about Social Security. And I don't know how people can make some of the arguments they make, because if you look at how dependent so many people are on their Social Security \u2014 they've worked hard for it, they retire, they postpone retirement as long as possible because they want to keep working, but they also want to, you know, get the maximum amount of payout from Social Security.\nYou know, the Social Security trust fund, according to the trustees, will be solvent until 2035. So what do we do to make sure it is there and we don't mess with it and we don't, you know, pretend that it's a luxury, because it's not a luxury. It's a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security.\nSo I think there will be some big political arguments about Social Security. And my only question to everybody who thinks we can privatize Social Security or, you know, undermine it in some way is \u2014 and so then what's going to happen to all these people like you, who worked 27 years at this other company?\nWhat's going to happen? It's just wrong.\nSo part of what we have to do is say, look, let's everybody take a deep breath. Let's figure out what works and how we build on what works. And let's not get into arguments, as I say, about ideology and rhetorical, you know, attacks and claims. Let's just kind of take a deep breath here as a country and say, OK, we're going to have a retirement issue and people who have worked hard deserve to have enough security when they retire so that they can have a good quality of life. And so I'm 100 percent committed to that.\nQuestion: That sort of dovetails with what Mary's situation \u2014 and I don't know your whole circumstances, Mary, but you know, Mary worked here for a number of years, quit, and then come back. If you could just talk briefly about why you came back and was it a \u2014 was it a financial decision or was just because you were bored or what?\nQuestion: Actually, it was a financial situation. As a homeowner there's always overhead that have to be done, those things you have to keep up that you don't really count on when you're not working. So coming back to work and I said I have, why not come back to Whitney Brothers? It's a place that I know I'm familiar with, I like it and I like the product. [inaubible] financially.\nClinton: Did you think, Mary, when you retired the first time that you had enough resources to be able to take care of your needs and then something unexpected happened?\nQuestion: Yes.\nClinton: OK.\nQuestion: Yes.\nClinton: OK.\nAre you \u2014\nQuestion: I thought I could \u2014 I could live like comfortable, not above but comfortable.\nClinton: What \u2014 did you start drawing Social Security?\nQuestion: Yes.\nClinton: What did you get a month, do you \u2014 do you remember what you were drawing on Social Security?\nQuestion: [inaubible]?\nClinton: Yes, when you started?\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: You don't remember what you \u2014 what amount you were [inaubible] amount?\nQuestion: Yes, yes.\nQuestion: [inaubible] amount.\nWell, I also had a retirement, too, but I dropped from a Social Security $1,400.\nClinton: $1,400 a month? OK.\nQuestion: Yes.\nClinton: So I think that, you know, if you \u2014 if you look just realistically, especially if you still own your home, you're still obviously very independent and able to take care of yourself, you are going to have a lot of expenses, both predicted and unpredictable.\nSo when you came back, did you believe that you were here for a period of years, or are you going to \u2014\nQuestion: Just \u2014\nClinton: \u2014 take it year by year?\nQuestion: \u2014 yes, part-time.\nClinton: OK, part-time. All right.\nQuestion: Going to catch up on those [inaubible].\n[laughter]\nClinton: I can tell, yes. They were calling you every day, saying, why don't you come back?\nIt really was a \u2014 it was really unexpected expense, right?\nQuestion: Her kind of experience, you know, being here so many years, it's really priceless, I mean \u2014 and that brings up something I would like to have you address and that \u2014 one of the biggest problems we have, Madam Secretary, is getting good CNC adult center trained in math and computers and, you know, we're \u2014 we compete against a lot of local companies that are \u2014 you know, you look at our ads in the local newspapers or on the Internet, I mean, i is CNC folks, it's a \u2014 people that have math skills. You know, we're \u2014 our machines are metric and our \u2014 the architects and dealers are in standards so where we're switching. So you need intelligent employees. And you know, we have the college and the high school do have technical services.\nBut it just doesn't seem to be [inaubible] we're always struggling to find people like that.\nWould you agree?\nQuestion: Yes, I do agree.\nQuestion: Yes.\nSo I mean, what \u2014\nClinton: Well, I met \u2014 I met a young man, I don't know if he's out here \u2014\nQuestion: Dan? Dan Brown, somewhere?\nClinton: \u2014 yes, he went to the Keene State College program to learn these skills and that's what we need more of, right. You need at the high school and the college level, community, four-year college, more programs that are related to the skills that employers actually need.\nYou know, what are the job skills that you are trying to \u2014\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: It's technical skills, it's \u2014\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: \u2014 I think there is a place for the humanities, but it's the technical skills, the electricians, the plumbers, those are the guys that we're looking for, and those are the people.\nClinton: Well, I think we have to get back to encouraging more young people to see these as careers and then we have to have both more education-based skills programs and employer-based skills programs, you know, the kind of apprenticeship programs and other training programs that are both public and private and try to give young people the opportunities.\nIt's really important that we do more to publicize why these skills are going to get you a good job. I think we have kind of lost the thread here. Too many young people don't know \u2014 nobody's told them that, you know, you can get a really good job, as you just named, an electrician or a welder, you name it \u2014 and the computerized numeric control systems that you're talking about on these big machines, that takes, you know, a year or two of training to really understand, because that's a level beyond what we typically think of as technical education.\nSo I would love to hear from you \u2014 and maybe start with you, indeed, Chris, because when people come for a job interview, where have they gotten their skills or do they even know that those skills would enhance their chance to get hired?\nQuestion: I think the majority of the people that come here, on the job training, they've been other places so they've done \u2014 it's not really any tool change.\nThere is a career center at the high school, but it's more metal and more wood. It \u2014 you know, it can go hand in hand, but with us, we look more for wood and it's more on-the-job training that people [inaubible].\nQuestion: Yes, so we're having to train relatively green people to run the machines. And it has worked out, but, I mean, again, you know, in the \u2014 in the local marketplace, we are competing against a lot of different companies that are \u2014 that need CNC operators. So you know, we might train someone for a year or two and they might go somewhere else for a couple of dollars more. And that \u2014 I mean, that's life, that's tough, but we would like to think that there could be a greater pool of technical \u2014 technically skilled people in this \u2014\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: Hard for us to retain the CNC operators because with \u2014 we are doing wood manufacturing and we are going against the overseas people. So we need to keep our costs low and we only can pay so much [inaubible].\nClinton: Yes, so you have got cost pressures plus skill pressures.\nQuestion: Right.\nClinton: Well, I think, first of all, we just have to have more programs that are going to prepare more people. I mean, that sounds so simplistic, but we kind of backed off from what used to be called vocational education and I think that we made a mistake because we backed off, thinking that it was going to be picked up by either businesses or community colleges, technical schools and that didn't happen fast enough. It's starting to happen now. There are more and more places where you can get these kind of advanced skills, but we need to create a bigger pool of people in order to meet the needs that you are talking about.\nI visited a community college in Iowa last year that takes high school students and trains them on CNC. And then they are able to really be job prepared when they leave high school, which is amazing. But they still have a relatively \u2014 they might graduate \u2014 I think they told me 30 or 40 a year, when the demand is much greater than that.\nSo I think we have to take up \u2014 I really approve of the president's proposal to try to make community college as free as possible. That would be a big help here in New Hampshire, where it's so costly. I mean, the amount of tuition is so high, both in the two- year and the four-year schools, but that still doesn't help unless we somehow provide incentives for more people, younger and older, to go into these trades, right.\nQuestion: Yes, I was just going to, you know, comment on, you know, being as if I had to switch jobs again for some reason, thank God I have \u2014 still have decent skills. As a \u2014 as a draftsman and designer, you know, I learned how to, you know, use the computer on my own without any education, which if I had more education, I might have been able to do more.\nBut to afford to go back to school, time wise as well as cost, is always hard, especially like say with health care and all that, you know, taking the little bits out of my pay, that there isn't any money for me to go back to school to try to get other new skills, to \u2014 and need to either enhance what I am doing here or to think about, you know, if I ever decided to move somewhere else.\nQuestion: Before I came to Whitney Brothers I had actually looked into a CNC program that's offered by the local community college, but it was only going to be in Clermont that next session and of course that was the middle of winter. And it's a bit of a hike up there.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: Fortunately, I found this place and it worked out very well.\nClinton: Now what are your hours of operation?\nQuestion: We're 7:00 to 3:30 but we're always doing overtime. So it goes to 4:30, sometimes 5:00, so it's eight or nine hours. And then during the summer occasionally we have skeleton crews on the second shift, because our \u2014 the nature of our business is the busy months are June, July and August and September, before school starts.\nClinton: I mean, I'm just thinking that you know, you have this equipment here, if you get some kind of grant or other support from either local government, state government, even the community college or the colleges and you know, you could have a program at night. I mean, it \u2014 you know, if somebody were to come in and basically say we are going to designate Whitney Brothers as one of our training facilities and your expert employees would get some kind of wage bump because you would be the instructors.\nI just think we've got to be imagining outside the old box about what we're going to do to get our skills up, how we're going to get more people of all ages to have the opportunity to improve those skills. Very hard to do it if you're already working during the workday \u2014 but maybe there could be some, you know, cooperative approach that might make a difference. I just \u2014 from my perspective, I hear it everywhere. I hear we don't have enough skilled workers, with technical skills. We don't have enough R.N.s and CNAs. We have a whole missing group of workers that could be employed you know, in our existing industries, and so how do we fix that? Because we don't fix it, we're not going to be able to be competitive. We're always going to be, you know, behind the curve in trying to succeed [inaubible].\nQuestion: Going back to changing the mindset, I mean, when I was in school and growing up, there was nothing wrong with being an electrician or a plumber or a carpenter. I mean, these were really good jobs and you know, you could make good money doing that. And it seemed to fall off the table. Everybody wants to go right to the top. Well, no, you got to be at the bottom before you can kind of work your way in there.\nAnd I think if we work in the high schools, even in the grammar schools in some points, you know, get these kids \u2014 a lot of kids just don't want to go to school. They don't want to go to college. You know, well, fine, you don't have to go to college to make a good living. But you have to get it out there, that it's OK not to go to college if you don't want to, but these are good positions. You can get a good job, you can make a good living, support your family by doing these other things. And I think that kind of got off track. Clinton: I agree with you.\nDoes anybody else feel that way?\nQuestion: When I was in high school, we had to have at least a semester or two of shop classes.\nClinton: When I was, too. Yes.\nQuestion: Everything it seems got computerized and everybody wants either sit with their gadgets or, oh, I'll design computer games. That's what I'm good at. I love \u2014 I'd love to do it. And [inaubible] do that. But you know, it is true, you need a nurse. You're going to get sick sometime, you know, we all want to live somewhere. We got to have these people building our houses. And we want to be here working at Whitney Brothers, you know.\n[laughter]\nQuestion: You've got to have that \u2014\nQuestion: Somebody has got to be making the \u2014\nQuestion: \u2014 at night when your [inaubible]\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: Somebody's got to fix it. Yes.\nQuestion: Yes.\nQuestion: That we're not all computer geeks. I don't think I could be one if I tried.\n[laughter]\nQuestion: You know? You just \u2014 you have to find your fit, you know. But I think the generation coming up needs that push to say, well, you know, here are some of these other things to do besides sit in front of a computer your whole entire life.\nQuestion: Yes.\nClinton: You know, one of the kids that they told me about at this community college, advanced manufacturing program, graduated from high school and got a $40,000 job as a welder because there was such a shortage. And he'd had a two-year program, passed some kind of national certification. So here he is, like 18 years old and you know, starting off on a really good track. Yes.\nQuestion: There was some \u2014 you probably know more about it than I do, but I heard it, that there are several high schools in Chicago that are affiliated with like IBM is one of them, one of their companies and it's an eight-year program, it's not four years and these kids are trained through high school and into this extended high school, as it were, being mentored by IBM. And when they get done, they are guaranteed a job at $40,000 a year in the company. And so, you know, you don't have to go to the University of Illinois. You're going to get your training right here. And I think five out of the eight schools in the country are in Chicago.\nClinton: Well, that's exactly the kind of model that we need to look at and try to see where we could implement that. I think we have to try all different kinds of approaches and first it's to figure out what's already working and do more of that. And then I think you make a very strong point, we have to persuade, particularly young people, that this is an opportunity, that this is part of the economy that really needs them.\nAnd yes, some might want to be computer programmers and some might want to be the best welder or the best plumber. But we have to make it once again attractive for young people to feel like that's a good route for them.\nWell, Dave, we will give you the last word because you have been here \u2014 how long have you worked here?\nQuestion: Thirty-two years.\nClinton: Yes.\nQuestion: A long time.\nQuestion: A long time.\nQuestion: But it's been great. I mean, it's a wonderful industry. And you know, I get to do R&D work by going to child care centers. And you know, you get little 3- and 4-year olds running around. And you know, it really is quite a \u2014 I have an enviable job. And then, but you know, we \u2014 I am still a small business owner and as such I have the 3M worries also.\nSo it's not all peach and cream. Actually, you know, in 2006 we had a flood and we had \u2014 actually there was about two feet of water where we're sitting. And the SBA was great to give us a low-interest loan. So kudos to the SBA.\nBut I guess one final question I might ask you is that capital improvements, you know, we like keeping our machines monitored and up to date and historically, I think the last 8-10 years we have been able to write off the capital improvements in the year that they were installed and now in 2015, they're talking about reducing that to $25,000.\nAnd I know that's Congress, but I'm curious as to your feeling. I mean, if you are president, are you \u2014 what can you do to help small businesses like ours to improve the equipment that we have and not make it so onerous that \u2014 so that we can \u2014 we can spread it out and still do right by the IRS?\nClinton: Yes, no, I think that's an important question and I can assure you that I don't want to make your life any more onerous. I want you to be able to invest in both maintenance and upgrading of existing equipment and, like that new printing machine you showed me, new equipment, if that's going to make you competitive.\nI think what we have to do is we have to look at the whole tax system and try to figure out what is an economic investment as opposed to one without economic purpose, because there are a lot of those, where people are just basically playing games and \u2014 you know, not \u2014 you know, like capital gains was supposed to be, for example, a way to reward people who made risky investments, you know, starting new business, investing in somebody else's business and now it's just being churned. And so we have to take a look at the whole tax system.\nBut I can \u2014 I can assure you, I would not support anything that makes your business more difficult to run, because you have a real business and you have real economic imperatives. You are in the production of goods and I want to do everything I can to support goods and real services and take a hard look at what is now being done in the trading world, you know, which is just trading for the sake of trading. And you know, it's just wrong that you know, a hedge fund manager pays lower tax rates than a nurse or a trucker or an assembly worker here at Whitney Brothers.\nAnd so I think we have to say, look, if you're doing something which is enhancing the economic productivity of your business and the larger economy, we'll be open to that, but if it's just you know, playing back and forth in the global marketplace to get you know, 0.1 of 1 percent advantage, maybe we should not let that go on. Because that is unfortunately kind of at the root of some of the economic problems that we all remember painfully from '08.\nSo I think that, from your perspective, I would want to be a president who made it as easy as possible for you to be as productive and profitable as possible because you've got 40-plus people whose lives and families depend upon that.\nQuestion: Yes.\nClinton: Right?\nQuestion: Yes, absolutely.\nClinton: Yes.\nQuestion: Yes.\nWell, great. It's been great to have you here.\nClinton: Yes, thank you.\nQuestion: Thank you all for coming.\nI know the secretary has got a busy schedule, so I think \u2014 I'm not quite sure how this works from here.\nClinton: Well, I think what we'd like to do is a picture with everybody who was in the roundtable. And then, you know, I want to say hello to some of my friends who are here.\n","28":"\n[joined in progress]\n[unknown student speaker]: I'll be graduating in May, and on graduation I'll be heading to Annapolis, the naval academy, to major in systems engineering.\nClinton: All right, good luck.\nEllen Charmin, Student: My name is Ellen Charmin (ph). I'm a junior at Monticello High School. I started taking Kirkwood classes my sophomore year. I began taking an online class. I'm currently in the arts and sciences academy. And by the time that I graduate, I'll have 48 credit hours done.\nClinton: Really?\nCharmin: Yeah.\nClinton:Year and a half. Wow. That's great!\nCharmin: Yep.\nClinton: OK.\nDiane Temple, Student: I'm Diane Temple. I'm an away girl at heart. For the last 21 years I've been a high school as an English teacher. I spent six years here part time as an adjunct composition instructor.\nClinton: Great.\nMason McLaughlin, Student: I'm Jason McLaughlin. I'm a 7th through 12th grade principal at Central City High School. We're one of the eight partner schools that partner with the facility to send kids of all grades for opportunities. We're happy to have you here. Welcome to Monticello.\nClinton: Thanks. Thank you.\nI'll introduce...[crosstalk]\nClinton: That's good. That's a good luck omen. [laughter]\nMcLaughlin: Yeah.\nDrew Mullin, Student: I'm Drew Mullin. I'm a junior at central city. I'm currently taking auto tech and biotech programs here. I've had a great time. It gives a taste of the college experience. I plan to go on and do something with engineering after I get out of high school.\nClinton: Great. Good. Thanks.\nBethany Moore, Student: I'm Bethany Moore. I'm what they call a non-traditional college student. I'm taking business administration management, and I also am doing the continuing ed program here at Kirkwood.\nClinton: Great.\nWell, first I want thank you, Nick, for having me here and a few of my friends in the college. I just had a terrific tour of the advanced manufacturing laboratory. I got to talk with the instructor and four of the students, all of whom are high school students who are doing what you have described as the great opportunity to mix your high school years with college learning and college credits as you move forward.\nAnd I am really pleased to be at a community college that is visionary and effective and trying to serve as a bridge for people who are non-traditional but coming back to add to their stills all the Beltway high school students who are taking advantage of the opportunities. And the cooperation between the college and the high school is something I want to see a lot more. This is a real model for how we can provide more continuous learning starting in high school but going as far as necessary to help better prepare not only young people but all people for the economy that is awaiting us.\nAnd before we get started \u2014 because I want to hear from each of you, I want more information about what you see as challenges as students and educators and the opportunities you hope to take advantage of \u2014 I just want to tell you a little bit about why I'm here today. I think we all know that Americans have come back from some tough economic times. And our economy and our country are much better off because American families have basically done whatever it took to make it work. But I think it's fair to say that as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top. And there's something wrong with that. There's something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical worker. There's something wrong when American workers keep getting more productive, as they have, and as I just saw a few minutes ago, is very possibly possible because of education and stills training, but that productivity is not matched in their paychecks. And there's something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here the last two days. And there's something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills in order to make the best of their own lives. I looked at the figures. The average Iowa graduate from a four-year college comes out with nearly $30,000 in debt. And that's I think the ninth-highest debt load in the country. And people are struggling. I met earlier today with a young student who is piecing together work and loans, knowing full well he's going to come out owing a lot of money.\nWe're got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track. And I'm running for president because I think that Americans and their families need a champion, and I want to be this champion. I want to stand up and fight for people so that they cannot just get by, but they get ahead and they can stay ahead. And a lot of people in the last few days have asking why do you want to do this? What motivates you? I thought a lot about it and I guess the short answer is I've been fighting for children and families my entire adult life, probably because of my mother's example. She had a really difficult childhood, was mistreated, neglected, but she never gave up. She had to basically be on her own at the time she was 14 but she just kept going. My father, who was a small business man, believed you had to work hard to make your way and do what you had to do to be successful, and provided a good living for our family. And then I was thinking, too, about the lessons from my church. You're supposed to give back. You're supposed to do what you can to help others. And that's what I tried to do. And we'll have more time to talk about as that as we go forward.\nWhen I got out of law school, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. One of the projects there was literally going door to door. This was back in the '70s when kids with disabilities were basically shut out of our schools. And thanks to your great former Senator, Tom Harkin, that's no longer the case. But I was knocking on doors asking is there anybody school age not in school, and finding blind kids and deaf kids and kids in wheel chairs who were just left out. And I was able in Arkansas to work to try to improve education there and give more kids chances who really deserved them. And as first lady, to fight for health care reform and keep fighting until we get health care insurance for kids. Then as Senator, dealing with the problems that faced New York after 9\/11 and trying to help people get what they needed, the victims' families and first responders. It was an incredible honor to do that. Then, as secretary of state, standing up for our country.\nSo when I look at where we are as a country, I'm so absolutely convinced that there isn't anybody anywhere who can outcompete us, who has better values, who can do more to provide more people the chance to live up to their own God-given potential. But we can't take that for granted. So I want to be the champion who goes to bat for Americans in four big areas, four big fights that I think we have to take on, because there are those who don't agree with what I think we should be doing. And they're pretty powerful forces.\nWe need to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. We need to strengthen families and communities because that's where it all starts. We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment, and we need to protect our country from the threats that we see and the ones that are on the horizon.\nSo I'm here in Iowa to begin a conversation about how we do that and to hear from people about what's on your minds, what the challenges that you see are. And I'll work hard to meet as many people. I'll be rolling out ideas and policies about what I think will work. But I want it to be informed by what's actually working and to build on what works going forward, and to stand up for those who have a different vision of our country, a different one than what I grew up with and a different one than I think is best for everybody.\nSo with that what I'd love to do is just, you know, ask a few questions and hear...[end of transcript]\n","29":"\nUnidentified Female: I'm getting ready for a lot of things, a lot of things.\nUnidentified Female: It's spring, so we're starting to get the gardens ready and my tomatoes are legendary here in my own neighborhood.\nUnidentified Female: My daughter is about to start kindergarten next year.

Thank you! Thank you.\nIt is great to be back in western Michigan. Thank you. Are there any Lakers here?\nOh, my gosh. I am so thrilled to be here. I want to thank the president of this great university, Tom Haas, the faculty, the staff, the students. I want to thank Brandon Dillon, the Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. And I especially really want to thank you for sending Debbie Stabenow to the United States Senate.\nI have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with Debbie, gotten to know her, become a friend of hers, and I am so excited at the possibility that I'll be able to work with her again. But I want you to know this - and I really, really hope you'll tell folks, because there is no more dedicated, effective member of the United States Senate than Debbie Stabenow.\nShe fights for all of you every day, but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face. And she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking. And don't we need more of that in Washington where people actually talk and listen to each other. So it's wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by Debbie.\nAre you ready to vote tomorrow, Michigan? Are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow? That is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow.\nThe choice in this election could not be clearer. And I know that for many people, you've gone back and forth, you've thought about what to do, and I really respect that. But let me say this. Let me say this. This election is basically between division and unity in our country.\nIt's between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk. It is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top. And I want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about. Because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot, those issues, and those values, are on the ballot as well.\nAnd as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election. I have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades, and people who ran for president. I was privileged to know as a college student, Gerald Ford.\nIn fact, I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee, which he headed, after my junior year in college. So when I say I've gotten to know a lot of our presidents, and people who've run for president, it goes back a ways. And here's what I want you to understand. I didn't agree with everything they did or said. Even the Democrats. We had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle, but I never doubted, I never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commander-in-chief.\nThat's why this election is so different. And it's why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me, and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party. Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election.\nI was at Kent State, in Ohio, last week and I was introduced by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Blair. And Mr. Blair had served in the Air Force, he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer. That meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed. And his job - imagine the responsibility. A young Air Force officer in his twenties, waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons.\nAnd Bruce Blair explained that there is no appeal from a president's order to do that. The joint chiefs of our military forces can't say, \"No, don't do it.\" There's no veto from Congress or anyone else. And the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes.\nSo after watching this election Mr. Blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing. And several dozen of them - I'd never met them before - several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief.\nThe awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something I want you to think about between now and the time you vote. Because I will pledge to you that I will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency.\nI also want to pose to you a contrast in visions. Did any of you see the debates? First of all, I did stand for four and a half hours with Donald Trump on the stage, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president.\nBut I have to say, in addition to that, there were so many things that he said that of course I sometimes was surprised by. But the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for America. Now I have to tell you, I know we've got problems. I've spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to - by now - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, hearing what's on people's minds. We've got challenges but America's always had challenges. And since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together?\nI often didn't recognize the country that Donald Trump was describing. Because from my perspective, looking back at our history, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. And you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America that will set the stage for an even better future.\nAnd I want to say especially to the students who are here - I really believe that America's best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together.\nMake no mistake. Our core values are being tested in this election. But my faith in our future has never been stronger. Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was introduced by Mr. Khizr Khan.\nSome of you know or remember that his son, Captain Khan, serving in the United States Army, was killed serving in Iraq. And like at the Democratic Convention this summer, he spoke powerfully about what America means to him. And how we have to defend our values and our Constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world. People look at us with yearning. They see that we are a beacon of freedom, hope and opportunity for people, right here, at home.\nWhen I heard Mr. Khan speak at the convention, and I heard him again last night, I was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country. He said that when he started hearing Donald Trump speak, and all of the things he said about so many people, not only Muslims but African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and women and so many people - when he heard it he couldn't help but think as he walked around his house - he has a room where his son's medals - he got the Bronze Star, he got the Purple Heart - the flag that was draped on his coffin - is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in. And he thought to himself, \"Would there be any room for my son in Donald Trump's America?\"\nThink about that for a minute. Because every single one of us has something to contribute. To this great country. We are already great but we can be greater. And we will be greater.\nI love our country and I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we can't do when we make up our minds. Throughout our history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy. They built the greatest middle class the world has ever known. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights and union rights, for LGBT rights, rights for people with disabilities.\nAnd now, now we've got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the chal-lenges of our time. We've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.\nIf you believe, as I do, that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow.\nWe are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.\nThese are jobs we need doing in American and these are jobs that cannot be exported. They've got to be done right here in Michigan and across our country.\nAnd we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing. I am not one of these folks who think, \"We just can't make it in America anymore.\" And I'll tell you why. Because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan, we can lead the world in precision machining, in 3-D printing. We're not competing for low-wage jobs, we're competing with Germany for high manufacturing, high- skilled jobs.\nAnd we are going to have clean, renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change. As you heard, my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas. And as I pointed out in the last debate, he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel, made by American steel workers.\nHe's gone all over this country, and he's gone all over Michigan, talking about how he's gonna really get more jobs and he's going to bring back what used to be there. Well I'll tell you what. Look at his record, don't just listen to his rhetoric.\nBecause I have a different idea. We're going to invest in America again. And for every-body who is frustrated, and anxious, and maybe even angry because they feel left out, left behind, that America's not working the way it should - I understand that. I under-stand that. I represented upstate New York for eight years, and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories, picking up and moving out.\nBut I also realized that anger is not a plan. You've got to come together and figure out what is it we're gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people.\nAnd I'll just tell you that I believe that we've got to defend the American worker's right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits.\nWe're gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state. And we're also gonna do more to help small business. My dad was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies, and I would from time to time help him out. You take a silkscreen, you put it down on the long table, you pour the paint in, you do the squeegee, you pick it up - it wasn't automated, we were the automaters - and you'd go all the way down to one table, you'd go to the other table. So I know how hard people in small business work.\nAnd I also know something else. Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills. And I have said, \"I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump, because we could not have afforded that.\"\nBut it's not just enough to grow the economy. We have to make it fairer. And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote. I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job. I believe in hard work. That's how I was raised. But I also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end of the year. And I'm gonna raise the national minimum wage.\nAnd one of the things I've heard all over America, especially from young families, really from all families but particularly young families, is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare? In lots of states, it's more expensive than college tuition. We're gonna get the cost of childcare down. We're going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you're sick you won't lose your job.\nI saw the folks over there holding up the Tim Kaine sign and I really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month, with a big crowd, and we couldn't get everybody in, like today, so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby, probably about three years old. And he stopped to talk to her and she said, \"I came here because I wanted to tell you, and to tell Hillary Clinton, what happened to me.\" She said that, \"I had my baby, it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off. And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I won't be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said, \"OK. You're fired.\"\nThat is legal in America, still. And what that does is to say that - wait a minute, do we really value children? Do we really value families? And we've got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today's America.\nAnd then finally, I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work.\nAnd you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause, as you can tell - but this is not just a woman's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter, who's in the work force, you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family.\nJust about everything I've said so far my opponent disagrees with. And whenever I talk about affordable childcare, and paid family leave, and equal pay - he says I'm playing the woman's card and you know what I say, if that's the case? Then deal me in.\nAnd here's what else I want you to know. It's fair to ask, \"How are you going to pay for that?\" That's not only fair, that's necessary to ask. Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect you're a good steward of your family budget. I have proposed a very simple formula. I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.\nAnd for small businesses, we're gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief. So instead, we're going where the money is, to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations.\nAnd that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed. His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations. That is trickle-down economics on steroids. I profoundly disagree. I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.\nWhen you think about it, Donald hasn't paid anything for 20 years. He's paid zero to support our military, our vets, Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley, our high-ways - and I am still pondering, I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year.\nEspecially when you're running casinos. I do not understand that. But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he's not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting. And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them.\nSo, we'll still wonder. But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs, not create jobs. And we can't afford that. We need to keep building. We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but we're not where we need to be yet. The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down. And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create.\nAnd if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote.\nAnd if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote. I've got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign about ideas and issues, not insults. And when it was over, we actually got together. What a novel idea. We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared. So Bernie and I worked on this plan together.\nPublic colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125,000 a year. And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt. And if you have gone into debt, if you're among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt, we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off.\nIt makes no sense at all. We have interest rates that are really low right now. Buy a car for what, 1 or 2 percent. You can buy a house for 3,4 percent. There are so many people who are paying 8, 10, 12, higher - 8, 10, 12 percent interest - how much? Twelve point seven. Fourteen point one. I got to tell you friends. That is outrageous. The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college.\nI can't wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and we're gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win.\nLook. Working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. And that has to be our mission together. Doing all we can to help every American, and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential. I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you.\nSo after tomorrow the work will begin, and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together. A lot of people say we've got to heal our country, or as the Bible says repair the breach. Because we have so much divisiveness right now. We've got to start listening to each other. Respecting each other. I know it is unusual, I admit, for somebody running for president, especially the day before an election, but I've been saying this for months. To say that we need more of two things right now.\nWe need more love and kindness in America.\nI don't know about you, I don't know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe, I hope, we've all extended one. I am standing here today because my mother, who was abandoned by her parents, rejected by her grandparents, went to work at the age of 14 as a maid, and a babysitter, was extended kindness. Not by those who should have loved her, but by others. The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food. The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school. She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents' home and she got this job. And that woman said, \"I know you want to go to high school. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you'll have to come back because we'll need you in the late afternoon.\"\nNow that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift. I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others. And \u2026\nThere's a version of the golden rule in every major religion. And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down. The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up? And for people in our country who feel like they've been knocked down and nobody cares, nobody's paying attention, here's what I want you to know. If you give me the honor of being your president I'm gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together.\nBecause I want to be a president for all Americans.\nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents. Not just the people who support me, everybody in this country. Because I believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future. So let's take that first step tomorrow. If you don't know where you're supposed to vote go to iwillvote.com - you can get all the information you need. If you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western Michigan in the last 24, 36 hours, you can still sign up to volunteer. Go to hillaryclinton.com. Or you can text join247246 or stop by one of our offices. We would be really excited to see you, because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you'll be able to say that you voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.\nAn America where we build bridges, not walls.And an America where we prove that yes, love trumps hate.\nThank you all so much.\n","31":"\nThis is amazing. What a great place. Thank you very much. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. But we should start. Do we agree? [applause]\nWe should start. So they'll come in. They'll come in.\nFirst of all I want to thank you. Special, special place. It's a special place with incredible people. In one day, do you believe this? One day we are going to win the great state of North Carolina... [applause]\nAnd we are going to win back the White House. [applause]\nThis election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class. You're seeing what's happening. Everybody's watching. Or whether we are ruled by the people. We're going to be ruled by the people, folks. [applause]\nThat is going to be the choice. A failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty, nothing but problems, nothing but losses. Nothing but losses. We don't win anymore as a country. We're going to start winning again. [applause]\nThey get rich by making America poorer in many cases. It's time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry. [applause]\nAnd these are among the most dishonest people. They don't give you the truth, folks. They don't give you the truth. [booing]\nThey rarely give you the truth. You know it. And they know it. That's the scary part. They know it.\nIt's time to fight for America. I'm not a politician, I can say proudly. My only special interest is you. It's you. [applause]\nWe're going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you. We're going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country. We're going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers. We're going to put them back to work. [applause]\nThe economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country.\nThe corrupt Clintons gave us NAFTA. China's too horrible entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the disasters. The job-killing deal with South Korea. That was a Hillary Clinton beauty. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will be a total disaster. [booing]\nThat Hillary Clinton said this is the gold standard. And you know what? It is the gold -- she lied. She lied during the debate. She said -- hey, by the way, who won the debate? Did we win that debate? [applause]\nBut she lied during the debate. She lied during the debate. She said it's the gold standard. And then she said she never said it.\nDon't worry about coal. We're bringing back coal, sir. He's holding up a couple of...[applause]\nClean coal. Clean coal. Right? We're going to do clean coal, the miners. The miners are going to be back. Not if Hillary Clinton gets in. The miners, I guess you got to start thinking about something else. But the miners are going to be back. Clean coal. Clean coal\nYou know, thinking about it, though. Also, people, the press doesn't talk about it. Donna Brazile gets the questions through a debate...[booing]...but then it turns out to be a number of debates. [booing]\nWho cares about Donna Brazile? She's turned out to be not what people thought. She gets, illegally -- illegally. She gets the questions to the debate. She then takes those questions and gives them to crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing]\nNow, does crooked Hillary report it? Does she say I shouldn't have these questions or these answers? I think they gave them the answers also, right? No, she doesn't. They doesn't.\nI wonder if she had -- I wonder if she had the questions in my debates. I don't think so because she didn't do that well. I don't think so. I don't think so. But the years of betrayal will end. And they will end. And they're going to end quickly. They're going to end as of the day we take office, which is going to be very, very soon. [applause]\nThe theft of North Carolina jobs will end. You've taken in harder than most states.\nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause]\nSadly, it's just been announced that the residents of North Carolina are going to experience massive double-digit premium hikes. Ninety-five...[booing]...of the 100 North Carolina counties will only have one insurer in the Obamacare exchange next year. Lots of luck negotiating.\nHonestly, it's not going to matter because we're going to win and we're going to terminate it. You're going to have such great health care...[applause]...for much less money. It won't matter. [applause]\nPremiums are searching. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting.\nBy the way, doctors, they're leaving. They're quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor. He said that I have more accountants than I have nurses, it's so complicated.\nAnd deductibles are going through the roof. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down and expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. [booing]\nI'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare, and save health care for every family in North Carolina. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you.\nThank you. [applause]\nPeople are pouring in, folks. They're pouring in.\nDid you see last night in Michigan the crowd we had? And the crowd we had -- by the way, how about 24,000 maybe 25,000 right next to Fort Brag. You saw that the other night. [applause]\nAnd we went to Minnesota. Minnesota's been treated very, very badly. We went to Minnesota where we're doing very well. Everyone said why Minnesota? That doesn't go Republican. It's going Republican this year, I'll tell you. Minnesota. Great place.\nAnd you know, you've been watching and you've been seeing and these people are being driven crazy, the dishonest media. We're winning Ohio. We're winning Iowa. We're winning, we think, New Hampshire. We're going to do great in New Hampshire. I hear we're winning North Carolina big... [applause]\nI hear.\nWe're winning Florida. We're winning Florida, doing really well. Headlines today are on drudge. how well we're doing in Florida. And I think we're going to win the great state of Pennsylvania, I do.\nThen we're winning plenty of other places. So we have to go. The big key, you have to go. You don't win a rigged system, folks. We're in a rigged system. You got to go. You got to vote. Got to make sure that vote gets registered.\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government\nThank you. Thank you. Wow. Great, great spirit.\nI have a job right next to -- we have a beautiful, beautiful property right next to -- right near Charlotte. You know about it, folks? It's great right? Some of the people. But it's an amazing place. It's an amazing place to work and to live, and we love it.\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. [booing]\nShe threatened national security, she sold her office to the highest bidder. And then to cover her tracks...[booing]...she deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena, nothing happens to her. Nothing happens [booing]\nShe's being protected by a totally rigged system -- General James Cartwright. A four-star general. Two weeks ago probably going to jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison. But he said he did it for national security reasons and I can understand that. Go to jail for up to five years. General betrayes, his life was destroyed and here she is she is running for president 25 times worse than anybody has ever dreamt. It's a rigged system. It is a rigged rigged system. [booing]\nDon't worry, folks. The cameras will never spin around and show this crowd. They never do. They show my face and the two people behind me, not the thousands behind me. They never do. They never do. [applause] [booing]\nSo dishonest. There they are. There they are. My group. Women for Trump. [applause]\nWomen for Trump. [applause]\nThey've been following me, these ladies, for a long time. How are we doing? Are we doing well?\nGreat people. Women for Trump.\nAnd now it's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow. At the ballot box. We're going to win.\nI think it's a great way of showing what we have to show in light of what's going on with justice in this country. I really do. I think it's a great way. You show it tomorrow. We show it tomorrow.\nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests. [applause]\nAnd folks, I was on the other side for a long time. It's a very good place to be. But I love the country. I love this country. I've really gotten to love the people of this country because I have been everywhere. We have the greatest people on earth. But I love this country.\nAnd I couldn't watch it when they made the Iran deal. They gave them $150 billion, a terrorist state. [booing]\nA state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful. We gave them a path to nuclear weapons. They were ready to collapse. We gave them, remember, $400 billion, right? We gave them $400 million. Then we found out that was -- it wasn't $400 million. It was $1.7 billion in cash. In cash. Do you know what $1.7 billion in cash is? You could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldn't have enough room. How stupid are we to allow this to happen? Our leaders are incompetent. President Obama is campaigning today with Hillary Clinton because she can't campaign. [booing]\nShe can't campaign. [booing]\nSo Obama is taking Air Force One, which costs a fortune. You know he's very much into the environment. And he'll take a massive, old engine 747. Very much into the environment. Very much into the ozone layer. And yet he'll fly that 747 all over the place to campaign for crooked Hillary.\nAnd I don't think it's going to work. And she's not getting any crowds. So she gets Beyonce and Jay-Z. I like them. [booing]\nI like them. [booing]\nAnd you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. [applause]\nIt's true. I get far bigger crowds. [applause]\nLook at this place. I mean, look at the crowds we had in Michigan.\nBy the way, Michigan is in play. It hasn't been in play for Republicans for 30 something years. Michigan is in play because they're tired of watching their car factories be taken out. They're tired of losing their jobs to Mexico.\nFord. Ford right now moved all of its small car production to Mexico. They're building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico. And Michigan has been complaining about it for five years to Mexico. [applause]\nNo, we're going to have some -- tomorrow's going to be a very historic day. I really believe that. I think it's going to show -- I think it's going to be a Brexit plus, plus, plus. Does that make sense? [applause]\nPlus, plus, plus. [applause]\nIt will be amazing. It will be amazing.\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we're all about to say. This is a phrase, I told you. I didn't like it. I thought it was hokie. But it's not hokie. It's called \"drain the swamp.\"\nWe're going to go to Washington. We're going to drain the swamp. Can't believe it.\nI told the story. I hated that expression. I said no way I'm going to say that, no way. That's so hokie. And I said it. The place went crazy.\nThen I said it to another place. It went crazier. Then I said it with more confidence because you know confidence is -- and it went wild. Now I love the expression. I think it was genius.\nDrain the swamp. Drain the swamp. [laughter]\nIs there any place better to be than a Trump rally? Are we having fun? [applause]\nAre we having fun? No? And I don't have a guitar. And I don't have a piano. All we have is great concepts for our country, which is the most important thing. Because frankly, when people get on stage, and they're entertainers, and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for Hillary Clinton.\nAnd by the way, they use the dirtiest language the other night. And it was -- many of the people left. You know they're political people. They heard words they've never heard before. They left.\nSo the place was half empty by the time -- actually, it never got full, even with them. Then it was pretty much empty midway through. And then most of the people just left. And when Hillary got up there was practically -- she might as well just have started with a few people. It would've been easier. [laughter]\nBut you know she hears those words. I won't use the words. I won't even address the words. Because if I do the crooked media will say \"did you hear what Donald Trump said today?\" [booing]\nBut honestly -- yes. [booing]\nThose words were disgusting. If I ever said those words that Jay-Z said or that Beyonce said the other night, you know what would happen to me? The reinstitution of the electric chair.\nIt would be -- how about if I got the answers to the debate? Or if I got the questions? Supposing instead of Hillary getting the questions to the debate, which is cheating. She's a cheat. She is a cheat. She never reported it. She is a cheat.\nSo supposing instead of her -- supposing somebody gave Donald Trump the questions to the debate. Headlines all over the world. He must withdraw from the race. You don't even hear anything about crooked Hillary. She got the questions.\nTo me that's such a big difference. Some people say, my people, oh don't mention that, it's just -- I say to me it's a big deal.\nIt's a big deal. But it's not a big deal for the dishonest media to say. They don't want to report it. But just think about it, supposing it was us.\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Bring them back to America. [applause]\nAnd by the way, you have a great governor. Support your governor. He's a great guy. [applause] Where is he? He's here someplace. He's a great guy and he's in a tough fight. And he's going to win that fight. But he's a great guy. So hopefully you'll support your governor.\nNorth Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and his lovely wife, Hillary. [booing]\nWell think of it. Think of it. Think of the numbers of jobs.\nHere's the one that gets me the most. Two things get me the most. Two things that just don't seem real. Because we're going to take care of our veterans, right? Like big league. Because our veterans are great.\nBut two statistics I can't believe. Twenty-two suicides a day for our veterans.\nThink of it. You wouldn't think that's possible. Because they're treated so badly. They wait on line for six, seven, eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription.\nBut two numbers I don't -- it just doesn't make sense. Twenty- two suicides a day for our veterans. OK? It doesn't make sense.\nAnd here's another one. America has lost 70,000 factories. Now I thought they meant 700 or 7,000 maybe. It's 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary Clinton-backed disaster.\nThink of it though. [booing]\nThink of what 70,000 factories is.\nSo those are the two numbers. They just don't seem to be real. Sad numbers. Sad numbers. Especially the vets, to be honest with you.\nWe're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. There's never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the United States. Our jobs are fleeing. Our companies are being taken. And leaving. And leaving.\nA Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America. And we will stop the jobs from leaving North Carolina. Believe me. [applause]\nIf a company wants to fire their workers and leave, as an example North Carolina, and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States through what will be a very strong border, by the way.\nWe will make them pay a 35 percent tax on every product that they ship back here. [applause]\nAnd here's what's going to happen. They're not going to leave. They're not going to leave.\nNow your politicians, some of them don't understand it. Some only cut taxes for the middle class. And by the way, Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes, and you know that [booing]\nSubstantially.\nSo one of the highest taxes in the world, she wants to raise your taxes. Same old story.\nWe will unleash the power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. Our plan will end the EPA intrusion into your family farms, and stop double taxation of a family farm at that. [applause]\nWe will cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations. Billions and billions of dollars. And we have no idea what they do with that money. I actually have a pretty good idea. You're not going to like it. And use that -- we're going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. [applause]\nAnd we will rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community, the Hispanic community...[applause]...have had such lies told to them. They live -- many, many people living in the inner cities of our country, they're getting worse and worse. The crime is unbelievable. You can't walk to the store and get a loaf of bread. Often you get shot.\nChicago. Thousands and thousands of shootings since Jan. 1. You read it. The murder rate of the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years. The dishonest media doesn't tell you that stuff because they want you to like Obama. They want you to think Obama is doing a good job. And he's not. [booing] And he's not. [booing]\nAnd he's not. [booing]\nSo you live in the inner cities. You're African-American. You're Hispanic. The schools are no good. There are no jobs. And it's totally unsafe. And I say I will fix it. What the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. [applause]\nWe are all going to fix it. [applause]\nWe're going to fix it. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to bring back safety. And we're going to get really good education going. There is tremendous potential, folks, in the inner cities, believe me, tremendous potential.\nWe will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. [booing]\nUnbelievable. It's unbelievable. [booing]\nHer plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. And you don't even know where they're going. Your government doesn't even know where they're going.\nWhen I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program...[applause]...and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]\nHave no choice. [applause]\nWe have no choice.\nAUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA.\nTRUMP: We have no choice.\nBut we're going to work because we all have hearts and it's a big problem, caused to a large extent by Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nThe migration, caused to a large extent -- ISIS was caused by them. They left a big vacuum. There was no ISIS when she first served as secretary. There was no ISIS. She created it.\nNow she stands at the debate, \"I will fight ISIS.\" She's got no chance. She's going to fight nobody. She wants to go home and go to sleep. [laughter]\nUnbelievable. She's going to fight ISIS.\nSo we're going to build -- we're going to build, we are going to build safe havens. We're going to have the Gulf States who have nothing but money, they're going to pay for it. We have $20 trillion in debt. And if it's OK, I'm not going to spend a penny. We have $20 trillion in debt. And we still have to rebuild our country.\nYou know it's one thing like when you buy a company and it's got some debt. We have $20 trillion in debt. But the country's a mess. The roads are bad. The bridges are bad. The schools are bad. The hospitals are bad. The tunnels are bad. Everything's bad. The military needs massive amounts of money.\nSo we have all this horrible debt. It's one thing if we had it and everything's in tippy top shape. I like to say. You know I like the properties. Give me them. I want them. Give me them. But we have them and they're a mess. And we have $20 trillion, which is far too much.\nSo we're going to get it down. And we're going to rebuild our country. We have so many things we're going to be doing. We're going to be a rich nation again. [applause]\nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause]\nAnd yes, we will build a great wall and Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent. [applause]\nOne hundred percent. [applause]\nMexico will pay. If you look at the incredible -- if you look at the incredible deficits we have with Mexico, it's unbelievable. What we have, the cost of that wall is peanuts, is peanuts compared to the numbers you're talking about on trade with Mexico.\nAnd the numbers with China? Trade deficit? I mean we will have a trade deficit with China of close to $500 billion this year. We are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods, we're going to lose worldwide close to $800 billion. What are we doing?\nYou really ask, who is negotiating these deals? Where do these people come? You know where they come from? They're political hacks.\nYou're dealing with the smartest people in the world. You have Chinese people, every -- you have from Japan, you have from all these other countries. They put their smartest and the best. We put political hacks that don't know what they're doing.\nSo we have an -- and we have the greatest in the world. We have the greatest business people. We have the greatest negotiators. We don't use them. We don't use them. We use political people. Some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions. [booing]\nWe're going to get it straightened out, folks, starting tomorrow. Go vote. Go vote. [applause]\nRight?\nMy women. Hillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. [applause]\nWe will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens. [applause]\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause]\nThere have been few times in our history where we've needed it more, few times. North Carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. [applause]\nBeautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful new fighters from Seymour Johnson.\nAnd we're going to have more battalions. You know the Marines are way, way off in terms of numbers. You know that. I know. Has there ever been? Yes, there have been. But rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now. The world hates us. The world hates us.\nSo we're going to increase -- thank you. We're going to increase Marine battalions at Camp Lejeune. I've been to Camp Lejeune...[applause]\nThey make major new investments. Where I was the other night, right next to it. I guess like 25,000 or 27,000 people at Fort Bragg. [applause]\nGreat people. All soldiers are tough. A couple of them shook my hand. It was like oy, whoa. Take it easy, fellas. They are tough cookies. They are strong. They don't know how strong they are. These are great people.\nAnd new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the Research Triangle. Right here. [applause]\nI'm honored to have the endorsements of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. And every day those numbers go up big league. Big league. Show Less Text\nAnd I asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by Fort Bragg. I asked them. I said fellas, let me ask you a question. They want to take over Mosul. Am I getting something wrong? Whatever happened to the element of surprise for us?\nI'm talking to admirals now and generals. That's what they do. I do other things. But you know it's called like common sense.\nYou got to say we've made a lot of right calls. I said why is it that four months away from going into Mosul they're announcing \"we are going into Mosul?\" We're going into Mosul because we want to get the leaders of ISIS and they're staying in Mosul. And then three months they're saying \"we are going in, in three months to Mosul.\" And then we're going in, in two months.\nAnd every time I hear, I put my hands, I go like this. I don't want to hear this, please. And as you know, they've been met with tremendous resistance, much more than they would've been\nAnd I guarantee you this. I can't say it with certainty, only about 99.9 percent, OK? I can't say -- nothing's 100 percent. Even our victory isn't 100 percent. But it's starting to look pretty close, isn't it? [applause]\nThose numbers. Those numbers. [applause]\nOh, these guys are unhappy. Look at them. They're not happy. They are unhappy campers. Starting to look good. [booing]\nStarting to look good.\nBut wouldn't it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago. Then they have last -- two weeks ago they go next week we're getting ready to raid.\nThe leaders all left. They're gone. And the other people are putting up much more of a fight. Horrible. They're using human shields. It's a horrible situation. I mean it's hell. It's hell.\nBut why do we just watch what's going on. Hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East that we never win. We just keep fighting and fighting. It's like a hose. The money just keeps pouring out. We never win.\nAnd now the Middle East is in worse shape by far than it's ever been. We have the Great Migration, the whole thing. They've dragged -- thank you. [applause]\nI don't even want to look. I'll get myself. I don't want to look. [laughter]\nThey'll make it -- I won't even say I love you too because they're going to make it a major headline if I said that. World's most dishonest people. The world's really dishonest people. [booing]\nThey dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. Shipped our jobs and wealth all over -- right open at home. You ever notice we send these incredible troops, so much death, so much injury, in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of. And yet we don't protect our own borders. Isn't it an incredible thing?\nThat will change starting tomorrow. [applause]\nBecause from now on it's going to be America first, America first. [applause]\nSo just in summing up, to all Americans I say it's time for a real leadership and time for change. We have to have change. [applause]\nCan you imagine having Hillary for four years? [booing]\nI'm being serious about that. I wouldn't want to watch the news every night.\nI mean look at what she's done with the e-mails as an example. I mean did you ever see a mess like this? Did you ever see -- of course the FBI -- the director was obviously under tremendous pressure. So they went through 650,000 e-mails in eight days. Right.\nSo sad what's going on. And she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from Congress. I mean that's a crime. What happened? That's a crime. You don't even need the new stuff. She shouldn't be allowed to run. Shouldn't be allowed to run.\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause]\nWe're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan.\nAnd Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially.\nWe're going to save and protect your Social Security and Medicare. [applause]\nAnd Hillary is going to cut your Social Security and really injure Medicare. That's what's going to happen.\nWe will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause]\nBy the way, a man that loves this state. It's his birthday today. Billy Graham, 98. [applause]\nThe father of Franklin. Billy Graham. What a great one, right? Ninety-eight years old. He is a fantastic man. Franklin's a fantastic man. And it's so wonderful to have support of people like that.\nWe're going to protect religious liberty...[applause]...rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. We're going to take care of our veterans. [applause]\nWe will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We move our education locally. [applause]\nWe will support the men and women -- these are great people, the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nWe're going to save our Second Amendment. [applause]\nAnd appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nThis sounds so good to me because I started this on June 16th of last year because I couldn't stand when I looked at what was going on with our country, I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it.\nComing down the escalator, right, with Melania. Coming down that escalator June 16 of last year. And they were all saying -- there were all the dishonest pundits. Actually a few of them thought I had a hell of a chance if you want to know the -- the smarter ones. But they were all saying but he's not involved with -- I've been involved with politics all my life, on the other side. But I've been involved.\nWe had 17 people -- by the way, one of the great people in here tonight, Mike Huckabee. Where is Mike Huckabee? [applause]\nHe's such -- is he here someplace? He is here. He is so great. Mike, wherever you are, come on out because you are great. I just saw him.\nBut we had 17 people of great talent. Ben Carson endorsed us. Mike...[applause]\nMike endorsed us. Tremendous -- I mean very talented people. And one by one by one -- and they used to say -- well I remember we were down to like 13 or 14. In one state I got 49 percent. And one of these clowns said \"he has not reached the 50 percent mark.\" I got 49 percent with like 14 people. How do you get 49 percent with 14 people? And they said he hasn't reached the 50 percent mark. They're very dishonest people.\nSo we ended up with 17 people, right? Don't forget that's hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent, or that violent.\nAnd we have a couple that didn't endorse and that's too bad. You know they signed a pledge. They didn't honor it. But...[booing]\nBut -- no. But for the most part...[booing]\nNo. For the most part they were very honorable. But it was rough. They said it was the roughest primary every. I would say this is the roughest election.\nYou know the NFL ratings are way down. You know why? Because everyone's watching this. It's actually tougher. It's actually tougher. [applause]\nEveryone's watching. The NFL ratings are way down. A lot of people say it's because of this.\nSo you had 17 people. You've came down -- but we've got -- and this is a tribute to everybody in this room. We got the highest number of voters in the history of the Republican primary system. [applause]\nSo well done. [applause]\nThat's a long time. You know, starting with Honest Abe Lincoln, right. That's a long time. I got more than Honest Abe. That's really the only thing I did better than Honest Abe. Honest Abe was pretty -- he was pretty good.\nSo here's the beauty. You have one day until the election. And it's not even one day. It's a half a day. To make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true. You have one magnificent chance. And honestly, in four years it's over, folks.\nThere has never been a movement like this. Even these dishonest people in the media say there has never -- Bill O'Reilly. He said it's the single greatest political phenomena that he's witnessed in his life. That's a pretty good statement. [applause]\nBut others have said it. Others have said it. Others have said it. And it's not going to happen again. It won't be able to happen again. Four years it'll never happen. So you got to get out there and you got to vote. Got to get out.\nSomebody said what you've done has never been done before. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. I said believe me, it matters. No, they said that. It'll be down in the history books. I said you know what? You may be right about that.\nBut if we don't win I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy. Wow do I -- you need energy for this. The single greatest waste of time, energy and money.\nI have over $100 million. That's a lot of money that I don't take in from the special interests because I don't need it. That's nice.\nAnd we have the biggest Internet -- you know the small donors? The small donors are giving us money at record clips. I think we had $82 million and then we had close to $100 million. And it comes in. And I think the average was like $61 each. I love those people. Those are people that love this country. [applause]\nAnd usually that's for the Democrats. You know in all fairness, that's usually for the Democrats to do that. But we're beating everybody. Nobody's seen anything like what we're doing.\nSo we don't want to blow it. We don't want to waste it. Go vote. Go vote. Because believe me, if we don't win, all of us, honestly we've all wasted our time, I'll be honest. Because nothing's going to happen.\nThey may say good things about us as a movement. Won't mean a damn thing, folks. You got to go out. We got to vote and we got to win. Change. [applause]\nChange.\nSo you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that you're witnessing today, and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation. Do not let this opportunity slip away. We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. [applause]\nAnd we're fighting, we're fighting to bring us all together as Americans. We're a very divided country. People don't realize we are an unbelievably divided country. We're going to come together.\nJust imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause]\nJust imagine.\nI'm asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. [applause]\nBecause if we win tomorrow, we will be able to make America wealthy again, to make America strong again, to make America safe again, and to make America great again.\nGod bless you, everybody. [applause]\nThank you. God bless you. Thank you, North Carolina. [applause]\nThank you, folks. Thank you. [applause]\n","32":"\nThank you all! Whoa! Thank you! Thank you. Well, I got to tell you, this is sure worth staying up for. It is so great to be here in Raleigh, here at North Carolina State University. And I cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to Lady Gaga. One of the most inventive, creative and passionate performers, whose range goes from A to Z and beyond. And I was watching on the screen not only her perform, but all of you jumping and singing and waving. It was great!\nBecause, you know what? That's what I want for America and the young people of America: the joy, the passion, the intensity! And our longtime friend, Jon Bon Jovi, was with us. He was with us up in Philadelphia, where he and Bruce Springsteen sang. And Jon said, 'Well, hey, I want to go down to Raleigh,' and so here he is! And between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be living on a prayer.\nI was really impressed when everybody's hand went up saying you'd already voted. Well, go find somebody else who hasn't voted, okay? Bring out your friends, your roommates, strangers on the street. Just stop and talk to them about what's at stake in this election. Because North Carolina is key, and it's not only important for our election. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper as your next governor? Well, I sure hope so. I sure hope so, and I hope you're ready to elect Linda Coleman your lieutenant governor. And how about Dan Blue, III, for state treasurer? And I really, really hope you will send Deborah Ross to Washington!\nNow, we are all fired up. When we were with the President and Michelle in Philadelphia. You know, the President was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is, and of course it is. I really believe it's the most important election of our lifetimes because we've never had a clearer choice. Never. It is a choice between division or unity; between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything. It's a choice between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as Americans.\nWhat I saw before I came in and what I see now is a sense of potential, of joy. There is no reason, my friends, why America's best days are not ahead of us if we reach for them together. We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America.\nOur core values \u2013 our core values are being tested in this election, but my faith in our future has never been stronger. I love our country and I believe in the American people. And I know if we bring everyone together, we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves.\nYou know, one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country, as I have in this campaign, is meeting remarkable people \u2013 people who stand up against the odds; people who, like my late mother, people who understand that everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up, whether you believe you can keep going.\nLast night, in Manchester, New Hampshire, I had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man, Khizr Khan, whose son, Captain Khan, was killed serving our country in Iraq. You may remember Mr. Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention. And again last night, he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution. The story of Captain Khan is one of courage in the face of danger. He was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle. He told his men to stay back. He moved toward the vehicle to check it out. And the bomb went off. He lost his life, but everyone else in his unit survived. He was awarded the Bronze Star. And this intensely personal tragedy that the Khan family experienced, becoming a Gold Star family, was one that they thought about, grieved over in the privacy of their home, until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in America and who wasn't. The categories of people, starting with immigrants, including African Americans and Latinos and POWs and Muslims. The list went on and on. And it created in Mr. Khan a sense of despair because he asked himself, would his son have a place in Donald Trump's America? Someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country.\nWell, we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly: Yes. Absolutely.\nThink about \u2013 think about how generations of Americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time. Our parents, our grandparents, our great-grandparents defended democracy. They built the great American middle class. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights, and women's rights, for LGBT rights, and the rights of people with disabilities. And tomorrow we face the test of our time.\nSo, remember, it's not just my name or Donald Trump's name on the ballot. It's the kind of country we want. It's every issue anyone cares about. So if you believe America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. If you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, small business, then you have to vote. If you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty, then you have to vote. If you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable childcare, paid leave, and equal pay for women, then you have to vote. And, remember, when my opponent says every time I talk about these issues that I'm playing the woman's card, well, you know what I say. Deal me in. And if you believe, if you believe, all kids deserve good schools with good teachers, no matter what house they live in, you have to vote. And if you believe college should be more affordable, you have to vote. Bernie Sanders and I worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free if you earn less than $125,000 and debt-free for everybody else. And for the millions of Americans struggling with student debt, we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off. If you believe in science and that we've got to address climate change, you have to vote. If you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so everyone is treated fairly, then you have to vote. And if you believe \u2013 if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws, well, then you know, you know, North Carolina. You've got to vote to get rid of HB2!\nNow, this is so energizing, we could keep going with a long list. But here's what \u2013 here's what else I want you to know. A good thing this election didn't land during exams, that's all I can say. Look. Tomorrow \u2013 tomorrow night, this election will end. But I want you to understand, our work together will be just beginning. We have to bridge the divides in this country. As the Bible says, we have to repair the breaches. We've got to be willing to start listening to each other again, respecting each other again. And I want to thank Gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting everybody.\nSo I want you to know and I want you to spread the word. I do want to be President for all Americans, not just some, not just the people who support me and vote for me. I want to be President for everyone because we all have a role to play in building that better future for our country and for each of you.\nSo if you haven't voted yesterday, go to iwillvote.com. You can get all the info you need. And you can still sign up to volunteer. Right? Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or stop by one of our offices. We would welcome you to help make sure everybody gets out to vote tomorrow because none of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we had done more. Right?\nAnd years from today, when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America, an America where we build bridges, not walls, and where we prove conclusively that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you! Let's go vote, North Carolina! God bless you! Thank you all very much!\n","33":"\nHello, Pittsburgh! Woah! Hello back there!\nThank you, thank you. Wow! It's great to be here at this extraordinary time in our country's history at this great university to have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights, to think about what we are capable of doing together. The kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground. And it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the hopefulness, to talk about the positive changes that are occurring.\nTo really see America at its best, and tomorrow, each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not, first, you will vote. Because in Pennsylvania, it's all about Election Day. Other places around the country have been voting for weeks. And what you will vote for.\nI'm here to ask you to vote for yourselves, vote for your families, vote for your futures, vote on the issues that matter to you because they are on the ballot, not just my name and my opponent's name. I want to thank Tom Colicchio for coming out here. He's in the middle of opening another one of his great restaurants, but he said he's got these two small kids and he just had to come and be part of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a record breaking number of Americans to vote. We are on the path to seeing more Americans coming out to vote than we have ever seen in our history.\nAnd I am hoping that you won't just come out to vote, obviously, I hope you vote for me, but I also hope you will send Katie McGinty to the United States Senate. We've got some great elected officials here, and I want to recognize Congressman Mike Doyle, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, from Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto, from Braddock, PA, Mayor John Fetterman.\nBut mostly, I'm here to say thanks. Thanks for taking time out to think about what's -- what the stakes are. I love you all, too. Absolutely! So for those who are still making up your minds or thinking, 'Maybe, maybe it's not worth voting at all,' let me just say: the choice in this election could not be clearer. It really is between division or unity. Between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon. Between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and an economy that is set up and run for those at the top.\nNow, I have spent my public career fighting for kids and families, and standing up for our country, and if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow, that is what I will do every single day of my presidency. I will get up in the White House, and I will think about what I can do that day to knock down barriers, to create opportunities, so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams. You see, I believe America's best days are still ahead of us. Now, that doesn't mean we don't have to work for it because we do. That doesn't mean that we can just expect it to happens as kind of a birthright, but I really believe that. I would not have worked for 18 months, travelled across our country, thought as hard as I have about what we need to do and how to do it together, proudly stand up and defend the legacy of President Obama, which has given our country progress in the right direction if I did not believe with all my heart that we could do this.\nRight? We can do this! We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. And our core values are being tested in this election. And I know that people are frustrated, a lot of people feel left out and left behind. There's fear, even anger, in our country. But I've got to say: anger is not a plan, my friends. If we're going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems, then we've got to start talking to each other again, and we have to get good ideas wherever they come from.\nLast night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was with Khizr Khan, whose son was killed while serving in Iraq. You might remember him from the Democratic Convention. He was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention, but when he heard my opponent say what he said about Muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his son's coffin, he felt compelled to speak out. He spoke powerfully about what America means to him and how we have to defend our values and our Constitution.\nAs he said last night, his son serving in the United States Army with his unit saw something suspicious, moved toward it to check it out telling his men to stay behind, and when the car exploded, he lost his life. He was awarded Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, but as Mr. Khan said, \"When you listen to all the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated, would there be a place in Donald Trump's America for Captain Khan?\" The Khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of this great country of ours, and they have stood up holding the Constitution as he did at the convention to say, \"People around the world cherish this Constitution, believe in our values. It's a source of hope for billions of people. We will never, ever let that go, and we never let someone rip it away in the kind of negative, divisive, hateful campaign that we have seen from the other side in this election.\"\nSometimes when I hear my opponent speak, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. That doesn't mean we don't have problems and challenges, it doesn't mean that we don't have to do more to help people across our country get better economic opportunities. Of course, we do. But boy, I believe we can do it. I love our country. I believe in the American people. I know what we are capable of. Throughout of history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy, built the greatest middle class that the world has ever seen, marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities.\nTomorrow, we face the test of our time, will we be coming together as a nation or getting further apart? Will we set goals that all of us can help meet? Or will we turn on each other and pit one group of Americans against another?\nNow, our names will be on the ballot tomorrow, but those values and every issue you care about will be there, too. What kind of country do we want, and I particularly think about this for young people as I look at this crowd and see so many students and young Americans that deserve the same opportunities that many of us were given. We will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving America, it comes down to a couple of key issues.\nIf you believe that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote. We're going to make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, small business, clean energy, advanced manufacturing. We're going to actually deliver on that unlike my opponent, who makes his products mostly overseas, buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of what's made by American steelworkers right here in Pennsylvania. We're going to invest in America, and we're especially going to invest in communities that are left out and left behind. We're going to stand up for the right of workers to organize and bargain. We're going to get incomes rising across America.\nAnd if you believe we need a fairer economy as I do, then we're going to raise the national minimum wage, because no one who works full time in America should still be in poverty. And we're going to do more to support working families with affordable child care, paid leave, and finally, equal pay for women's work.\nI've got to tell you, this always get's about the biggest applause ever because fundamentally, we know it's not fair, but it's also about families. If you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter who's working, you don't want her shortchanged, do you? Now, when I talk about equal pay and all of these other family issues, my opponent says I'm playing the woman's card. Well, you know what I say: deal me in.\nIf you believe all our kids should have good schools and good teachers, no matter what zip code they live in, then you have to vote. If you believe we can make college affordable for every young American, then you have got to vote.\nI've got to say, I was very proud of the primary campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign on issues and ideas, not insults. And after it was over, he and I got together, and we came up with this plan. Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year. And it should be debt free for everybody else. I don't think you should go into this massive debt to get your education. It's good for you, it's good for your families, it's good for our country, and we're going to make it affordable for everyone. And for the millions of Americans already struggling with student debt, we're going to ease that burden. We're going to get those interest rates down, we're going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income, not tied to a six, eight, 10 percent interest rate, and you're never going to have to pay more than you can afford.\nYou see, I think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about. And I think the agenda we've put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope. You see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now.\nSo this has to be our mission together \u2013 doing all we can to help every American, especially every young American and especially every child, to have the chance to live up to your God-given potential. Because when it's all said and done, that's what matters the most. Have you helped somebody else? Have you reached out and tried to ease somebody's burden? We do it individually.\nMy mother got through a neglected, abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness. Her own parents didn't want her. Her own grandparents didn't want her. But that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat, brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat. And when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody's home, she was just relieved that she had somewhere to live and that she could support herself. But the mother of that home understood my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said, 'Dorothy, if you get up early and get your chores done, you can go to high school. You'll have to come right back because I'll need you, but you can do it.'\nAnd look, that sounds harsh to our ears, telling a 14 year old, 'Okay, you can go to high school but you have to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it.' But to my mother, it was a blessing. So when I think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we had had, and I'm speaking for myself, my mother gave me the resilience, the grit, the get up and go. She told me, 'Everyone gets knocked down. What matters is if you get back up.' And we had a lot of Americans knocked down because of the Great Recession, didn't we? Millions of jobs were lost, millions of homes were lost. Family wealth was wiped out, savings account, 401K's, everything that people had worked so hard for.\nWell we've dug ourselves out of the hole and now we need to get up, and we've got to make sure we don't leave anybody behind. I see this man here standing with a sign: 'Coal Miners for Hillary,' and I'll tell you sir, I know how hard times are. And as I have said, and you can take it to the bank, I will not forget you and I will do everything I can to help people who have given so much, worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country. We are not going to forget any American! But I can't do any of this without your help tomorrow.\nThis election is going to really set the course of our country. There's no doubt in my mind. Tonight, I'll be in Philadelphia with President Obama and Michelle and I so appreciate how hard they worked for me, but it's not for me. It's for us.\nWhen President Obama came into office, put yourself in his shoes -- this young, dynamic, first African-American elected to become President of the United States. And what does he find? He finds the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that's what he finds.\nWow, those were hard, hard times. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn't go even deeper in the ditch we were in. But make no mistake: there were reasons we ended up in that ditch. It didn't happen by accident. We had huge tax cuts on the wealthy, the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened. They ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened.\nElections have consequences for everything we care about. And that's why we've got to each and every one of you put down your stake in our future. If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait. In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line, asking them, all types of Americans, not one type -- all types, 'Why are you here?' 'Because my future depends on it,' they say.\nSo tomorrow is the election, but that is just beginning. We have to heal this country. We have to bring people together, listen and respect each other. Now I know it's unusual for somebody running for president to say this, I started saying this months ago, because I was literally meeting who were scared about what they were hearing in this election. I've known a lot of the Republicans who've run for president been elected president in recent history, I didn't agree with them on everything, obviously we had our differences, but I didn't doubt that they were fit to serve as president. This election is different. This person is temperamentally unqualified, experientially unqualified to be president and so many people know that.\nSo I think we do need more love and kindness, right? We have to got to rise above all of this hate filled rhetoric, all of these insults and scapegoating and finger pointing and insulting. I want to be a president for all Americans. Not just some. I want to be the president for Democrats, Republicans and Independents. I want to be the president for those who vote for and those who vote against me. I want to represent everybody. Because I know we have a role to play in building a better future.\nSo it starts tomorrow. If you don't know where to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can get all the information you need, the polls will be open from 7 AM to 8 PM. We are on track, as I said, to have a huge turnout. But we can only do that if all of you make up your minds, you bring all your friends, everybody you know, to make sure your voices are heard.\nThis is a historic, historic election and we're going to do everything we can, not only to win, but then immediately to get to work. And I especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours, go to hillaryclinton.com, text join, J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6, stop by one of our offices. We would love to see you. Because when your kids and grandkids ask what you in the future what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say: you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we finally prove once and for all that, yes, love trumps hate. Thank you.\n","34":"\nHello Detroit! Thank you! I'll tell you, I am so glad to be back in Michigan. And that introduction, I'm just still vibrating from it. I thank my longtime friend, Reverend Wendell Anthony, for giving us some of the best lines that we've had in the whole campaign. Thank you Wendell.\nYou know, there's something special about this place. And some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when I came in, an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day called 'Rise Up.' And that is what Detroit is doing \u2013 you are rising up! And that is exactly what we're going to do in America. We are going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone.\nI'm looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan. I want to thank your senators, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters. I want to thank your members of Congress, Congressman John Conyers, Sandy Levin, Congresswomen Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell. I want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Mike Duggan, and thank you. Wayne County Executive Warren Evans. Sheriff Benny Napoleon. The president of the UAW, Dennis Williams. Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine, former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here. And to all who are present today. And I was delighted that my friend and my supporter, Mark Cuban, could be here because \u2013 he's not only a real billionaire \u2013 he's actually shared his profits with his employees.\nNow, are you ready to vote on Tuesday? Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote? Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief? Did any of you see the three debates that we had? Well, I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.\nNow, he kept saying a lot of unusual things, didn't he? And, you know, there's a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates, and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States. And I did practice my composure. People said to me, well, how did you do that? The things he was saying. And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you. I said, well, I did practice. And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me. So I was ready. But he would say, like, 'Well, what have you done for 30 years?' And you know, I don't want to brag. But I do think it matters what you've done, and especially what you've done that maybe improves somebody else's life, right?\nAnd one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we've been doing. For example, as First Lady, I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids. And these are families that they're not poor families, they're working people, but they don't make enough money and they don't work for somebody who provides insurance, and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had. I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf, and the doctor said, 'We're sorry, there's really nothing we can do for her.' But this mother, like many mothers I know, did not take that for an answer, right? She got on the internet. She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter, but they were expensive and she and her husband didn't have that kind of money and they didn't have insurance. She was at her doctor's office and just so distraught, and the doctor said, 'Well, there's this new thing called the Children's Health Insurance Program. Maybe you should look into it.' Turned out she was eligible. She signed up. She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have, by the way. And when I was in North Carolina, I heard about her and I got to meet her, but more than that, I met her daughter, who talked to me and who just graduated from college \u2013 because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.\nI'll tell you what, that is how I judge my last 30 years. Have I done something to help somebody else? I am well aware of the blessings that I have had, and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward, make it possible for more families, more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.\nAnd I was a Senator in New York on 9\/11, so I know what can happen \u2013 the evil and the hatred of terrorism. I saw it. And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger, not away from it \u2013 our police, our firefighters, our EMTs. And I'll tell you who else we got covered. We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools, and I see one right out there who knows exactly what I'm talking about. All across the city, people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger. That was America at its best. And don't ever forget what we are capable of being, who we are. We are not afraid. We are brave, courageous people who will do our best if given the chance.\nAs your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, negotiated ceasefires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and worker rights and LGBT rights. I'm telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can. If I am honored to be your president, I will get up every day in that White House, and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have.\nI want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against. That's why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues, not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election, it is a choice between two very different visions for America. I've got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. It is so dark, so divisive, so hateful. That is not the America that I believe in. I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we're going and how we're going to get there. I love our country, and I believe in the American people. And I think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them. You see, we believe in an America that is bighearted, not small-minded. We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part. And we believe America is great because America is good. Never forget that. If we lift each other up and not tear each other down, we can go even further. And I believe with all my heart. That's why the slogan of my campaign sums it up, that we are stronger together.\nAnd so come next January 20th, America is going to have a new president. I know \u2013 I know that \u2013 I know that a lot of people say that they want change. Well, let me tell you this. Change is inevitable. There will be change. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have?\nAre we going to build a stronger, fairer, better country or are we going to fear the future and each other? I sure hope not. That is not the America that I believe we are.\nAnd so here is what I want to ask you to do. I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors. Michigan is one of these states that doesn't have early voting. I've been all over the country going to states that are already voting. In fact, I don't know. About 31 to 32-3 million people have already voted in those states. But Michigan votes on Tuesday.\nAnd I imagine \u2013 I imagine there are \u2013 some of you know people who say they're going to vote for Donald Trump. Right? I know. I know. I understand that. I mean, I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before it's too late. But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine, imagine January 20th, 2017. And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol. Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled, who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims, who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively. Now, the truth is we really don't have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done, both in his career and in this campaign, tells you what could happen.\nNow, Michelle Obama, who says so many wise and wonderful things, she said the presidency doesn't change who you are; it reveals who you are. And I think we've seen who Donald Trump is.\nMaya Angelou, another great American, Maya Angelou said, when someone shows you who he is, believe him the first time. And if my opponent were to win, we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself.\nJust last year, he said again it wouldn't have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt. What is he talking about? I'm proud that President Obama saved the auto industry. And I'm even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry just had its best year ever.\nIf Donald wins the election, we'd have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States. We are a country founded on religious freedom. That runs contrary to our Constitution. We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities. He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field. I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony, don't you?\nYesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins. Decades ago, she was a hard-working nurse in New York City. She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent. But Donald Trump and his father, Fred, turned her away. You see, whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments, their application was marked with a 'C,' C for colored. And that didn't sit very well with Mae, so she went to the authorities, and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination. And although they settled, they wouldn't change. So the government had to take them back to court. That's a pattern. This is what happens time and time again with my opponent. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department. If he doesn't respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?\nHe has such a casual disregard of our Constitution. He doesn't seem to understand the rule of law, that we really are a nation of laws, not men. Here's the latest example. There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City. It was called the Central Park Five. Maybe some of you have heard of it. There were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. They were wrongfully convinced, and they were in prison where they spent years. Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids. And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime, Trump actually said they should still be in prison. It doesn't matter if you're innocent. If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up. No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin, because that's exactly what Putin does to his people.\nSo we can't trust him with our Constitution. We can't trust him to obey the rule of law. He has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. So let me paint you a different picture. Here is what we're going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.\nWe have three big challenges. Number one, we got to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. Number two, we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity. Number three, we've got to bring our country together. We have got to overcome these divides. We have to heal our nation. And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.\nI have said repeatedly that we're going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back, it can lead to holding other people back. We can't accept as normal what we're seeing across our country because of his campaign. A church in Mississippi was burned this week. Someone painted 'Vote Trump' on the side and then set it on fire. We can't let \u2013 we can't let that happen. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable. Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water. Those are basics. We've got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.\nAnd it's important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody, that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II \u2013 infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy technology. Some people say we can't do that. Well, I'm telling you, they're wrong. They're wrong. We have the best workers, the most productive workers. We're going to give them more to work on, more products to produce. And we're going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities. And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America. That means we're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.\nAnd we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in. And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs. And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers. We've got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children. And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.\nIt'll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other. I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. And that's what we're going to work for.\nWe're also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent. Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now? Really. We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place.\nAnd while we create more safe communities, we want to invest in those communities. I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done, one named Clinton, one named Obama. And I want to be a really strong partner. I'll compete a little with them. I want to be a really strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support, the housing, and the jobs that you need.\nBut we also have to make sure our economy is fairer. That's why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage, because people who work full time should not be left in poverty. And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? This is not a women's issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a daughter, or a sister who works, it's your issue. It's a family issue. And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare, paid family leave, equal pay for women, the other side accuses me of playing the women's card. I'll tell you what, if standing up for equal pay is playing the women's card, then deal me in.\nAnd one of the other big challenges we're going to take on \u2013 I am so excited about this. I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues. And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate. So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university, you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125,000 a year. And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you don't go into debt. And for people who already have student debt, we're going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it. And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.\nNow, this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign, because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election. I had a friend say to me the other day, 'People are just frustrated and angry.' I get that. I understand that. We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in '08 and '09. Millions of people lost their jobs, millions lost their homes, family wealth was wiped out. That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that. I get it. But I learned a long time ago from my late mother, anger is not a plan. Right? Be angry, vent about it, and then roll up your sleeves and get to work. That's what I will do. That's why we've put this all down. It's on our website, hillaryclinton.com. It's in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called 'Stronger Together.' Because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president; I want you to hold me accountable. I want you, when I come back to Detroit, which I will do when I travel around Michigan, which I will do, I want you to say, 'Well, how's it going getting those new jobs started? How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable?' I believe in making lists. Maybe it's a women's thing. My husband said \u2013 once said to me one time, 'You have lists of your lists.' Well, I do because I want to know what we're going to get done and how we can make progress together.\nAnd ultimately, this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids, and in my case now, my grandkids. Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all?\"\nAudience: \"Yes.\"\nClinton: \"Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal? I believe we can do this together. My opponent at his convention said, 'I alone can fix it.' Well, no, nobody alone does anything. When our founders met in Philadelphia, it wasn't one person creating our country. It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers' rights and women's rights and LGBT rights. None of them \u2013 none of them were won by one person alone. The American labor movement didn't happen because somebody one day said, 'I alone can make it happen.' It took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in. Barack Obama wasn't put into the White House by one person alone. It took everybody working and organizing, and yes, voting. That is how progress happens in America.\nSo really, it all comes down to you, my friends. You have to vote. Our progress is on the line. Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line. I'm ready to defend and build on the progress that we've made. I'm proud I was a member of President Obama's cabinet. I'm proud that \u2013 he and I are friends. But he knows and I know that American leadership, American presidents, it's like running a relay. You do your very best, and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesn't drop to the ground or doesn't turn around and run back the way we came from, which is what my opponent is promising to do.\nNow, I've told the President that when he hands off the baton that he's going to have to bend over. He's a lot taller than I am. But I'm excited about what we can do. I know this has been a tough campaign. I've got people coming up to me saying they've got migraines they never had before. They have stomachaches that they don't know what they're going to do with. I get it. It has been in many ways a really tough campaign, but I'll tell you what. Michigan, you can make the difference.\nAll I'm asking you is talk to your friends, talk to your family, talk to your coworkers, talk to everybody. If you have time to volunteer, go to hillaryclinton.com to volunteer or text 'join,' J?o-i-n, to 47246. Because when your children \u2013 and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today. When your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.' An America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate. Let's get to work. Thank you. Thank you, Detroit. Thank you, Michigan. God bless you.\n","35":"\nThank you. Wow! Thank you all. Woo!\nThank you. Thank you. I -- I got to -- I got to say, after hearing -- after hearing from these two extraordinary men I -- I feel all fired up and ready to go for the next five days.\nIt is so great to be back here with all of you, and there are a few people in the audience that I just want to acknowledge because I'm delighted they're there -- U.S. Congressman David Price I saw right there.Thank you, David.\nState Senator Dan Blue Jr., I know, right there. Thank you, Dan.And I'm not sure she's still here, but Deborah Ross, who I hope is your next senator. There she is!\nBecause everything Pharrell and Bernie just said is not only about the presidential election and what's at stake, it is about who's going to represent you as your governor, as your senator, as members of Congress and the legislature, and you have some excellent candidates. And we are so hopeful that you will vote for them and vote for what they represent.\nNow, I really want to thank my friend, Bernie Sanders, for everything that he has done.\nI -- I got to serve with Bernie. We were colleagues in the Senate. I saw firsthand his commitment to the people of Vermont and to the values that have guided his life. And when we faced each other in the primary, here's what I was so proud about. We ran a campaign on the issues that matter to the American people.\nAnd I -- I think because of that campaign, we were able to raise a lot of the issues that you heard Bernie talking about to the level that they are part of this presidential cam-paign, and they will be part of our agenda after January 20th, Bernie.\nAnd I've got to say, too, this election has been a lot more fun now that we're on the same side.\nAnd I want to thank Bernie for everything he's done. He's crisscrossing our country, energizing people, getting folks off the sidelines and engaged in politics. And there's no question that his efforts are paying off.\nAnd what he said at the beginning of his remarks is absolutely true. My name may be on the ballot, but it is not about me, it's not about my opponent, it's not about Bernie, it's not about David or Deborah, it is about you and your lives and what we're going to do together.\nNow, Bernie and I have already worked, we've worked on the plan that he told you about to make college tuition-free for the middle-class, for working families, for poor kids and debt-free for everyone.\nBecause as Bernie said earlier this year, when people who care about progressive causes stand together, we win, and then we can get to work on making those causes into realities for the lives of our people. So I am proud to be here with you and I am so excited about -- of the election, about everything that we're going to do together.\nAnd I'm especially pleased to have Pharrell here.\nNow, every time I see him, which is not often enough, we always have a good conversation like we did before this event. He always gets you to think. Not only is he a world-class talent, but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored. He wants to -- and I'm going to do everything I can help him -- to deliver -- giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child.\nSo tell me this, tell me this, North Carolina, tell me, North Carolina, are you really, really, really happy that we're here tonight?\nWell, we sure are. There's nowhere we'd rather be.Now, let me ask you this, how many of you have already voted?Well, I hope you're going to bring more people to vote as well, right?Are you ready to volunteer?\nWe can all use you in these last days. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper?\nWell, I'm glad to hear that because it's time you had a governor who puts families first, not radical ideology.And I love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of North Carolina.\nNow, are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? I'll tell you -- I'll tell you, Deborah and her race are the talk of everywhere. People know she will be an independent voice for North Carolina families, that she will represent you with integrity and excellence. And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nAre you ready now to choose our next president and commander-in- chief?\nWell, I'm -- I'm excited. Did any of you see the debates?Well, you know, there's several -- there's several notable aspects of those debates.\nI mean, one is the very fact that I stood on the stage for four and a half hours with my opponent proving, once and for all, I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief.\nBut you know -- but you know, he -- he also kept saying, like oh, well you know, what have you done for the last 30 years? And you know, occasionally I would interject and say what I had done.\nAnd today, in Greenville, we had a perfect comparison. I started my career fighting for children and families with the Children's Defense Fund when I got right out of law school in the 1970's.\nI went to South Carolina to gather evidence to stop the government in South Carolina for -- from putting young men, teenagers in jails with adults. I went to Alabama undercover to gather information about segregated academies to deprive them of tax-exempt status, which they did not deserve.\nI went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, gathering information to make the case that every child in America, including children with disabilities, should have the right to a public school education.\nAnd as we heard this morning from a -- just a wonderful, distinguished older woman by the name of Mae Wiggins who came all the way down to tell her story. She was a nurse in New York City back in the 1970's, excited about being a young nurse, getting her career off to a start. And she was looking for a place to live, and she had a budget like everybody does. And she found what she thought would be the perfect place. It was within her budget. It was close to work.\nShe went to apply for an apartment. It was a new building -- brand new building. It wasn't even totally finished yet. She went into the little office and asked for an application and they said, \"Oh, we don't have any apartments.\" She said, \"But I saw the advertisement.\" \"Well, we have no apartments left.\"\nWell, she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her African- American friends who had gone to that apartment run by Donald Trump and his father, Fred, had been told there were no apartments.\nSo she had the gumption to go and make a complaint, which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination. They settled the suit, but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating.\nSo when you hear, as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks, that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously, my friends, because it truly is -- it truly is at stake in this election.\nAnd I was also very, very grateful. I had a role in helping to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady, and let me tell you, one of the great -- one of the great honors as I travel across the country is meeting young people who are the beneficiaries or meeting their families.\nI met a woman here in North Carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born. Her daughter, she was deaf. And the doctors all said she'll never -- she'll never communicate, so she cannot learn to speak, so you need to teach her sign language.\nAnd the mom did all this research and concluded that there were some treatments that might help her daughter, but she didn't have that kind of money. They didn't have that kind of insurance. And she was telling her doctor she didn't know what to do, and the doctor just serendipitously said, \"You know, there's this new program, it's called the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's for people who are not poor, but they don't make enough money to afford that kind of insurance, and they don't work for an employer who provides it. You should look into it.\" And she did. And that began the process of her getting the treatment that her daughter needed.\nAnd when I met the mother, I also met the daughter, right here. I talked with her. She told me how proud she was because she had just graduated from college, George Washington University.\nSo, yes, you know, I do sweat the details and I do have a lot of plans. Tim Kaine and I put a whole book out called \"Stronger Together\" telling you exactly what we're going to try to do if we're fortunate enough to be president and vice president because I actually think it's important for you to know what we're going to do together.\nAnd as your -- as a senator, I helped to rebuild New York City after 9\/11 and provided health care to our brave first responders. As your secretary of state, I traveled to 112 countries, negotiated cease-fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and LGBT rights all around the world.\nAnd you know, everything I've done started by listening to people. Listening to hear your stories, what you're worried about, and then working to bring people together to find common ground, even with people who disagreed with me on lots of issues.\nYou know, when I was first lady, I had a great commitment to kids in foster care and I wanted to improve our foster care and adoption laws, and I was looking for some Re-publican to work with me, and I found one because I did my research and found out that one of the most partisan Republicans, Congressman Tom DeLay from Texas, had a heart for children in foster care. He and his wife had fostered children, and I called him up.\nI said, \"Congressman, would you work with me to change the laws on foster care and adoption?\" There was a silence. He said, \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" I said, \"Well, come to the White House. Come to a meeting. We'll sit down and figure out what we can do.\" And we did, and I meet those kids, and I meet those families, kids who were taken out of foster care and given the chance to have a loving permanent family for the first time.\nNow, I'm telling you this because I really believe that's the only way we're going to get things done. And if you elect me next Tuesday, that is the kind of president I will be.\nSo, let me just mention a few of the ideas that we've been putting forward to help you and your families get ahead and stay ahead because I truly believe you need a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against.\nBut as you're making this choice, we need to be clear about what the choice is, because come January 20th, America will have a new president. It will either be me or my opponent.\nNow, I think it's fair to say, things are going to change. Change is part of life. That much is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to see? Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better America or are we going to fear each other and fear our future?\nI want you just to imagine, imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who's elected on January 20th, because by imagining it, I want you to think about every issue you care about, everything that is dear to you, everything that you heard from Pharrell and from Bernie.\nIt's hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women, mocked the disabled, insulted African-Americans and Latinos, pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together. That is, unfortunately though, what we have seen in this campaign, what we have seen, what's been said and how distressful it's been.\nI know there are a lot of people who are upset about what's going on in this campaign, aren't there? People come and talk to me. I've had people say that they can't sleep, that their stomachs are bothering them, they have headaches. And I think that's an im-portant signal because this is a big decision. And as Michelle Obama has said, the presidency doesn't change you -- who you are, it reveals who you are.\nAnd I think it's fair to say that my opponent has already revealed who he is. And he wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to the United States. Our country is founded on religious freedom. It is one of the most important building blocks of our democracy.\nHe has said that he thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and des-pair. He has no idea -- no idea about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black-owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities.\nHe seems not to recognize the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field.\nAnd we saw that again in the way he treated the Central Park Five. These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14, who were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York City back in 1990. Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence.\nAnd in addition, someone else confessed to the crime, so they were finally released from prison. But not only did Trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions, he actually said, \"They should still be in prison.\" Evidence didn't matter. The law didn't matter. To him, those kids would always be guilty.\nSo think about it, if he wants to keep exonerated people in jail, how can we trust him to fight for the rule of justice and fairness and criminal justice reform in America?\nDo we want him appointing our judges?\nAudience: No!\nClinton: Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?\nAudience: No!\nClinton: Well, I've said many times, he has shown us who he is, now it is up to us to decide who we are. And right now, people across our country are coming together to do just that. They are rejecting the dark and divisive vision for one that is more hopeful and inclusive. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear each other down.\nAnd that's why I do believe we are stronger together, so let me paint you a different picture. Here's what we're going to do together. We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow-through because we refuse to accept as normal some of what we're seeing across America.\nWhat happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not have happened and it should never be accepted. People painted the words \"Vote Trump\" on the side and then set it on fire. Who would do that? Who would do that to a place of worship where people seek solace? That can never be normal. It can never be acceptable.\nWhat happened in Flint, Michigan, as Bernie said, can never be normal, can never be acceptable.\nLittle children drinking and bathing in poisoned water that will affect their health for years to come.\nAnd then we know, don't we? Too many young African-Americans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence.\nWe know their names; Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner and Sandra Bland and Keith Scott and so many others. We have got to face this, and we're going to get to work to do just that. We are going to - we are going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and we're going to replace it with a cradle-to-college pipeline.\nAnd we're going to start with our youngest kids and their families to give them the support that they need. And we're going to take a hard look at what we need to do to make sure every child has the chance to attend good schools with good teachers, no matter what their ZIP code is.\nAnd we will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end. It is wrong, my friends, that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same offenses.\nWhen I -- when I launched this campaign back in April of 2015, the very first speech I gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform. I said then and I have repeated it throughout this campaign, we must end the era of mass incarceration.\nToo many families have been broken up, too many communities have been so badly affected. We have to reform these mandatory minimums and sentencing. We have to ban the box so people who have served their time can get a real chance at a good job and a fresh start.\nAnd we have to restore trust between police and communities. We are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.\nThis is important, of course, to families and communities, but it is important to all of us. This is about who we are as a country, about whether we really are a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all. Too often, despite the progress we've made, we fall short of that goal, and we have to be honest about it.\nI am determined to make this one of the most important projects of my presidency and I hope all of you will join me in doing that.\nAnd I have to say - I have to say that is only part of what must be done because the leading cause of death for young African-American men, more than the next nine causes.\nWe have 33,000 people a year dying from guns. I just cannot tolerate this any longer. I have met the families of those who have lost loved ones, who have lost the first graders in Sandy Hook, the bible study churchgoers in Charleston, the club-goers in Orlando, the moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short. We have to take steps to reduce gun violence, and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well.\nAnd we've got to make investments in those communities that are struggling, especially communities of color.\nWhen I was in eastern North Carolina today and I was talking to people there who had been devastated by Hurricane Matthew, people who didn't have very much to start with, who lost everything, farmers with 100, 200 acres growing sweet potatoes, wiped out. We've got to help everybody get ahead.\nI believe that the economy must work for everyone, not just those at the top. And I think hardworking Americans deserve a raise and women deserve equal pay.\nSo, how are we going to do this? Well, we're going to go where the money is. Just as Bernie said, we're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again.\nAnd I can't wait to work with Bernie to make public colleges and universities like N.C. State right here at Raleigh tuition-free.\nI know that this is another issue Pharrell feels passionately about as well. If you're struggling with student debt, we're going to cut that and help you pay it back and get out from under it.\nAnd in my plan is a $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities - schools like Shaw and Saint Augustine - because you know they produce some of the finest leaders in our country, and I want to make sure they keep doing that vital work.\nSo we could go on all night. I mean, Bernie and I could really keep you here until breakfast because we get excited about what we can do. But of course, we can't do anything if you don't get out and vote and get everybody you know to vote.\nThis is going to be one of the most consequential elections in our country's history, you know that, because we are at a crossroads. It's not just who my opponent is. Pharrell is right, we don't even have to mention his name very much. Right? It's not just about him, although there are some special features that certainly raise deep concerns. It's about who we are. It's about what we want, what we're going to do to make our mark on our country at this time in our history.\nI believe -- I believe America's best days are still ahead of us if we do what we're sup-posed to do.\nEvery social movement, every economic advance has only come about because people were willing to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the face of adversity. It's not easy. It wasn't easy to get the vote for women. It wasn't easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the Civil Rights Act was enforced. It wasn't easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down.\nAnd right now, you know, because in this state a lot of effort was put into trying to suppress the vote, right?\nAnd some people got discouraged about that. I've met some people who say, well, you know, I don't even know what they want, what kind of identification. It gets a little discouraging. You cannot get discouraged. Do not grow weary while doing good, right?\nIt is now our turn -- our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back because we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise.\nAnd in this election, President Obama's entire legacy is on the line, everything that he has worked so hard to do against implacable opposition. As the president said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent upon him being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he believes in.\nSo I got to tell you, I've told the president I'm ready to take the baton, but he's going to have to bend over because he's a lot taller than I am.\nBut I'm not just taking it, all of us are taking it. We are ready to grab that baton, to defend and build upon the progress of his presidency, and that is why everyone must vote. Early vote and vote on Tuesday if you can't get to early vote.And listen to this, more than two million right here in North Carolina have already voted.\nSo make no mistake about it, you can make the difference, not only in who you elect, but in the agenda that those people will then get to work on. I want you to hold me accountable. I want you to be my partners, but I can't do any of this.\nYou know, when I was with our wonderful first lady last week, she reminded \u2014she reminded the big crowd we had in Winston-Salem that President Obama in 2008 won this state by about 14,000 votes.\nIf you break that down, you know what the difference between winning and losing is? Roughly two votes per precinct. So don't let anybody tell you their vote doesn't matter. You've got to get everyone you know to come out and vote. You can vote early through this Saturday, November 5th. If you don't know where to vote, go to iwillvote.com to confirm your voting location because the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in American history.\nAnd then that will be the story of this election. Let's make that one for the history books. Please be part of what we're doing in these next days and let's make sure that we not only have a future we can believe in, but one we can help create together, and demonstrate, once and for all, that love trumps hate.\nThank you all.\n","36":"\nHello, Dade City!\nI am so excited about being here. Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome. And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us. Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support. I'm also delighted that we're joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.\nI also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly. And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [inaudible] for his pledge of allegiance. And thanks to all the elected officials here. And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!\nIt's almost hard to believe, isn't it? There are only seven days left in this election.\nSo are you ready to vote?\nAre you ready to volunteer these last seven days?\nI hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick, who's been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families. And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nNow somebody asked me the other day, 'Why do you keep coming back to Florida?' Just look around folks. I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it's also really important in this election. Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what's at stake in this election. Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.\nOne week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States. I don't think the choice could be any clearer. I have spent my career fighting for children and families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice. I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president.\nNow, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.\nWhen a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, 'Well then why are we making them?'\nAnd I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told the crowd \u2014 it was a big crowd at Kent State University \u2014 I think every voter should hear. Basically \u2014 his name was Bruce Blair \u2014 he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal. There is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, 'We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.' And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.\nSo when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.\nSo is immigration. Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do? I don't think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don't think that's right.\nNow maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.\nOr maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University. And so Trump said, 'Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.' Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called \u2014 well, but wait a minute, \u2014 he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, 'The definition of a racist comment.'\nAnd then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.\nAnd then let's not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. Honestly if this were something new, I think we'd all be asking ourselves, 'Well, what does he have against President Obama?' Or what does he have against me? But this is not new. I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.\nAnd here's what I want you to tell. I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He said, 'Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.' So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama \u2013 literally better than anybody, I guess. And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, 'I alone can fix it,' runs counter to who we are as Americans. We work together.\nSo there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president. But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because \u2013 Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States. And during those debates, Donald always used to say, 'What have you been doing for 30 years?' And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out. And so I've been a lawyer, and I've been a first lady, and I've been a senator, and I've been Secretary of State, and I've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I've been a woman.\nAnd when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he's been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And, I've got to tell you, some of what we've learned \u2013 some of this stuff is very upsetting. I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we're going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. How we're going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university. And if you're above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it.\nBut I can't just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds. This is a consequential choice, so we've got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters. We can't just wish it away. And a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this. I don't blame them. If I were supporting him, I wouldn't want to hear it either, to be honest. But I've got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it's not okay to insult people. It's not okay.\nAnd look at what he does. He calls women 'ugly,' 'disgusting,' 'nasty' all the time. He calls women 'pigs,' rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10. We just heard from Alicia. She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her 'Miss Piggy.' He called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she's a beautiful Latina. He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. Now, he also said, 'This is somebody who likes to eat.' Well, I have to say: who doesn't like to eat? I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?\nBut you've got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And, I'll tell you who: a bully, that's who. And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald Trump doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.\nBut what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth? If you've got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to.\nNot so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl. And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I'm doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson. Because, let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite \u2013 they don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be. Right?\nAnd I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school. And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together. But before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day. We'd talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them. And we want them to be strong, and we don't want them to feel bad about themselves. And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down \u2013 lifting people up and respecting women.\nIn fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they're love, they're cared for, they're respected. I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world. But that's what I want for every child. I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency. I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?\nSo I know there's work to be done. We can't do it with just words alone. We've got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified. And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women. I'm not going to repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women. And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come to say that, 'What he said on that tape is what he did to me.'\nAnd then we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them. He said he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault. 'Look at her,' he said about one woman. 'I don't think so.' About another, he said, 'She wouldn't be my first choice.'\nHe's also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed. He said he did that \u2014 he said he did that to 'inspect' them. That was his word \u2013 and he said, 'I sort of get away with things like that.' And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, 'Yes, that's exactly what he did to us.' Now, as bad as that is, he didn't just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He's also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant. Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old.\nWe cannot hide from this. We've got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump's words have shaken her to her core.\nFor a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that's brought back painful memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it's been shocking to see this. He tried to explain it away as 'locker room talk,' well, I'll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, 'Not in our locker rooms. That does not happen.'\nWell, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.\nAnd I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.\nHe doesn't look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities. And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign.\nWell, he's very wrong. He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country. He has shown us who he is. Let us on Tuesday show him who we are. We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said. He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry. Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder.\nWell, I have a message for him. We're going to fight for affordable childcare. We're going to fight for equal pay for all people. We're going to fight for paid family leave, we're going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that's important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that's especially true for minimum wage workers \u2014 who \u2014 two-thirds of whom are women, so we've got work to do my friends. I'm excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be. Because instead of Donald Trump's dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying.\nBut I can't do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida. Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together. And voting on all the issues that they care about. It may be my name and Donald's name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!\nHere in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.\nIn fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes' drive away. You can go there right after this rally and vote. Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election.\nAnd if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.\nDon't wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers.\nDonald Trump's strategy is pretty simple\u2013 he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are.\nNow I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump. And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them. Ask them what they care about. Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy. Because Donald Trump's economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year.\nSo there could not be, no matter what you care about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump, and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.\nWe are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls, knocking on doors, it really matters, turn out matters.\nPlease go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved. Here is what I want to leave you with. You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater. The main reason America is great is because America is good. We are a big hearted, generous people. Not a small minded people. We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign. But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance. For America, this is one of those make or break elections. It really is in your hands.\nI hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th. are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope, I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren. That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America. Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!\nThank you all.\n","37":"\nThank you so much, wow, it is great to be here.\nAnd thank you. I am so honored to be introduced by Mae Wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who, as you can tell, just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race.\nIt took a lot of courage to come here, Mae. Thank you. Thank you for being with us.\nI also want to thank a long-time friend of mine, a great activist, extraordinary advocate in Congress, and that's U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. I want to thank Mayor Allen Thomas for welcoming me here. And either you're all related to him or you think he's doing a good job.\nWell, I told him I want to be a good partner with mayors like him. And work to help communities like Greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people. He told me that the average age in the residents here in Greenville was 26 years old.\nI also want to acknowledge Josh Stein, candidate for North Carolina attorney general. Patsy Keever, chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party. And State Senator Don Davis.\nAnd I saved the best for last, someone who I've gotten to know over the years; someone who I really look forward to working with. First thing that Congressman Butterfield said to me is \"I have to talk to you about our farmers.\" Very first thing he said. Proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200-acre sweet potato farm earlier today. We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding. And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected. We've got to be really focused on what we're going to do with this extreme weather. We're getting more of it in more places. And I'm going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared. They're resilient. But that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns.\nAnd nobody knows more about weather than our farmers. And I am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes, but particularly small farms. You know, I think you said the farm you went to this morning, G.K., was 200 acres. You know, that's a lot of land, but that's not a gigantic multi-thousand-acre farm. And sometimes I think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big, giant farms, and not enough taking care of the smaller farms, the family-owned farms, farms that have been in people's families for generations.\nAnd I will do my very best working with G.K. and Eleanor and others in Congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it. And eastern North Carolina is a place that needs it. There are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind. And so we've got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along.\nThat is my goal as your president. I want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead. Now also, on a personal note, I was in Arizona last night and had a great rally there. I don't know -- 15,000, 16,000 people. It was just extraordinary. But I was a little anxious during my speech because the Cubs were playing in the World Series.\nAnd, you know, I've been a fan all my life; started watching baseball with my dad; went to Wrigley Field. And, you know, it's been a long time, 108 years, to win a championship and make history. And I only wish that my late father and the great Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub, could have seen it happen. So last night was very special on lots of fronts. And who knows? Maybe we'll see even more history made in a few days. You know, the last time the Cubs won, women couldn't vote. And I think women are making up for that in this election.\nSo thank you. Thank you so much for being here. Are you ready to vote? How many -- how many folks have already voted? [applause]\nWell, that's really impressive. Are you ready to volunteer these last few days? Are you ready to elect Ray Cooper your governor? Have a governor who puts families first and your needs. I know he'll do a terrific job.\nAre you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? She will be the independent voice that North Carolina families deserve. And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And then, are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief?\nYou know, did any of you -- any of you see those debates? Well, you know, I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief.\nBut, you know, he kept saying things like, \"Well, you know, what have you done for 30 years?\" Well, we know what he's done for 30 years, starting with discriminating against African Americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s.\nI chose a different path. I have spent my career fighting for kids and families. And I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady. That now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year. And I have to tell you, I know it doesn't make headlines. It's not going to, you know, get a big Twitter war going, but when I travel around and shake hands like I'll do after my remarks, and somebody says to me, \"The Children's Health Insurance Program saved my son's life.\" I met a woman here in North Carolina whose daughter was born deaf. And the doctor said, \"You know, she's never, ever going to be able to talk; she's not ever going to be able to hear.\" Her mother, who is determined, began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments. But they were expensive. She didn't know what she was going to do. And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said \"I just heard about this new program, the children's health insurance program. Maybe you can qualify for that.\"\nBecause it's really for families that aren't poor, but don't have much money, and a lot of families isn't it. And families that don't have an employer that provides health insurance, self employed, independent contractors.\nSo, the mom found out about this thing call the children's health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter. I met that young woman, and she said hello to me and she talked to me. She just graduated from college, right here in North Carolina. So don't let anybody tell you, it doesn't matter what you stand for, what you fight for, and who you are trying to help. When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.\nAs a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9\/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it. And many of them\u2014\nAudience: [inaudible]\nClinton: Where you there? God bless you. That's another thing, I meet people all over who were there, and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there. And as your Secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's right and LGBT rights around the world.\nAnd everything I've done, it's because I've been listening to people and again I know that's not very exciting. I plead to that. You spend time listening not talking, you know, what are the poor journalists going to say, \"Uh, there Hillary Clinton was listening again,\" right?\nBut I'll tell you it is what motivates me to hear people's stories, to hear the tribulations and triumphs. You get good ideas. Bring people together; find common ground, even with people we disagree with. I disagree with people on lots of issues, but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other, and try to find common that common ground. And that will enable us to get results for people. And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President I'll be.\nAnd from the first day of this campaign, I've been telling you what I want to do. Putting forth my ideas about what I think will help you. I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for, not just someone to vote against. And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear. The positives and the negatives, because one way or the other, come this January, America is going to have a new President. And it will be either me or Donald Trump.\nAnd you know what else? People say all the time, you know I want change, will come, that is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to have. Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America, or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices, our discrimination that stops us from coming together? So, here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe haven't yet voted, maybe haven't yet made up their mind. I want you to ask them, imagine it is January 20th, 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.\nImagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office, making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures. Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults African Americans and Latinos. Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together. Someone who always puts himself first and doesn't care who gets hurt along the way\nA president with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him. Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope. The truth is we don't have to imagine what that would be like, because everything that Donald Trump has said and done, both in his career and in his campaign, is a preview of what could happen.\nYou know as Michelle Obama says, the presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are. And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump. If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous. Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war. And yet this morning in Florida, Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote \"I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had\". Now -- he knows we can see and hear him, right?\nThis is someone who at another rally, yesterday, actually said out loud to himself, stay on point Donald, Stay on point. His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters, stay on point Donald, stay on point. You know, we have seen it over and over again. We know his true self. His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head, no matter how wrong he is. He can't help himself. So is this someone we want to put in charge of our military?\nIs this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated, his disrespect throughout this campaign. In a country that values, religious liberty and freedom. Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country. Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea, none, about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field. Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins. And Mae wasn't alone. Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment, their application was marked with a \"C\" -- \"C\" for colored.\nIn fact, Donald, his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s. They settled the case, but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color. Think about that. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department. If he doesn't respect all Americans, how can we trust him to serve all Americans?\nAnd then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the \"Central Park Five.\" These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. Who, it turns out, were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.\nDonald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence. Also, someone else confessed to the crime. So they were finally released from prison and justice was done, but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison.\nTo him, those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says. Do we want this man appointing judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?\nAudience: No!\nClinton: Well, people who are voting for him, that's what they would get. He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters. He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories. And you better believe he's being heard loudly and clearly.\nJust a few days ago, and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party. Just a few days ago, Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan.\nThey wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign, \"Make America Great Again.\" They said it's about preserving white identity. And they placed their faith and hope in him. You've got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution, who believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trump's America?\nIt's not just about communities of color. It's about young people. It's about any of us who don't ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated. That is not who America is and we're not going to let it ever go back to that.\nBut it doesn't end there. You've also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either? Imagine our daughters, or in my case now my granddaughter, growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent. Just imagine what that would mean to young women's confidence and self-worth. And how that will affect our young men and boys, who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.\nSo, this is a pretty clear choice, North Carolina. I've said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. Right?\nAnd across America, people are doing just that -- rejecting Trump's dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful, inclusive and unifying. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear people down.\nWe are called -- we are called. In fact, we are commanded, those of us who are Christians, to love our neighbor as ourselves, aren't we? We are not asked, we are not requested, we are not urged -- we are commanded. And we know how hard that is. When I used to teach Sunday School, I often taught on that, not because it was well known, but because I think it's so hard and challenging.\nLove your neighbor as yourself? Well, first, you've got to love yourself. You've got to respect yourself. And then you have to love your neighbor as yourself. I believe with all my heart that we are better than this. And that's why I want to paint a different picture. Because here's what we're going to do if we win this election. We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through.\nWe are not going to accept the status quo. What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal. People painted \"vote Trump\" on the side. And then they set it on fire. Who would do that to a house of worship? In America, that can never be acceptable. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them. And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence. You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott. So many. We can't accept that as normal either.\nSo we are going to get to work. I'm just telling you. If I'm fortunate enough to be your president, we're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work, because that's when we're at our best, solving our problems.\nWe're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-career pipeline for every child in this country. I want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they live in.\nWe will reform our criminal justice system from end to end. It is wrong. And I don't care whether you are black or white. It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes. It's wrong, and we're going to do something about that. And Donald Trump, whenever he's face with these issues says \"well the answer to our problems is more law and order.\" He doesn't tell you what he means by that, but it's kind of code for fear and division. What I think we need to do, is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.\nI think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law, and everyone is respected by the law. And it's not all, we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, because right now, we've got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers, terrorists. You know, we can't just bow down and say theres nothing we can do, commensurate with the second amendment. Donald's always trying to say \"oh, you know, she's going to repeal the second amendment.\" What nonsense. Absolute nonsense. But I believe we can respect and honor the second amendment, and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.\nAnd we're going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind. Congressman Butterfield and I were talking about this. There's some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities, white, black, Latino, Native American, wherever they might be that have been left out. We need to get the engine of economic growth going, because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage, because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind. And I think not only do Americans deserve a raise, which Donald doesn't agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage, I think it's finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do.\nI don't know about you, but this is not just a women's issue. I'm always accused by Donald and his supporters, that whenever I talk like that, I'm playing the woman's card. Well, I've always said, if that's playing the woman's card, deal me in, you got that right.\nBut I actually think I'm playing the family economics card, because if you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter, she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force.\nAnd we're going to have a big investments in new jobs, infrastructure jobs, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. And we're going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities. Put people to work, doing work that has a really productive purpose. We're going to invest in more clean, renewable energy jobs, these are jobs that cannot be exported, they have to be done right here in eastern North Carolina.\nNow it's fair to say \"Ok, that sounds good, how are you going to do all that?\" Ok, I'll tell you two things. First, I have said, and you can hold me to it, I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,00 a year. You see, I come from the middle class. My dad never made anything near that, even in those dollars back in those days. But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. Not the top down, that does not work for most Americans. And so, secondly, I'm going where the money is. The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years. And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy? It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself, to his family, to the wealthy, to corporations. I just think that's a bad, bad idea.\nWe're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and we're going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again. And we're going to make public colleges like East Carolina University tuition-free. Tuition-free for working and middle class families, and debt free for everybody else. And if you're struggling with student debt, we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills, and get you out from under debt. And we're going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.\nBut I don't think that every young person needs to go college. If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships.\nThere is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent, and I'm asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are, and what kind of future we want. I just don't believe we're at our best when we stoke fear about each other. Now, that does not mean we have to agree about everything, of course not. But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.\nI don't think I have all the answers, I don't think anybody does. When Donald Trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in America, I thought about our founders meeting in Philadelphia. It wasn't one person creating our country, it was many people working together. Think about every social movement, every economic advance, every university like this one, every achievement that you've made in your own life, somebody helped you. You worked with somebody. Look at this community. Everybody working together, making Greenville really grow and thrive, making this university better and better every single year. That is my experience of America, so here's what I hope you will do. I hope you will get everybody you know, and yourselves , if you haven't voted yet, to vote early. Because the other's strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls. Now, Donald Trump's campaign knows that if women turn out, if people of color turn out, if young people turn out, if people who share our vision of a positive unified country, turnout, there's no way he can win, because that is more than half the people in America.\nYou may have noticed that President Obama was in Chapel Hill yesterday. He's coming back to North Carolina tomorrow, because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington. As he said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does. Well I'll tell you what, I'm ready to grab that baton. He's going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it, because you know he's a tall man. But I've been practicing. I spent four years working with him. I call him my partner and my friend, and I am ready to defend and build on his progress, coming out of his eight years of the presidency.\nSo let's get out and vote, and let's vote for the kind of future that we want, the kind of country that we want. Find your early voting location for the next three days, please, go take people there. We will show once and for all, love trumps hate, thank you all.\n","38":"\nThank you, everybody, thank you. Wow. These crowds. [applause]\nThese crowds are terrific. Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida. And we are going to win back the White House. That will happen. But you have to get out, you have to vote, we have to get out there. We don't want to blow it.\nThat I can tell you because we have worked very hard, all of us, you, me, everybody. And it's very historic what's happening. I'd like to begin today by thanking all of you for joining me. This has been an incredible journey and we've all done it together. We're almost at the end. [applause]\nBut we're really at the end of the beginning if you think about it. Aren't we? The end of the beginning. Our magnificent history movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn.\nAnd now, next Tuesday, we will have one last glorious surprise for the pundits, the politicians and the special interests and return the power back to the people. It's going to happen. [applause]\nIt's going to happen. It's been the honor of my life share this journey with you, it has absolutely been. [applause]\nThere are two people, however, who I did not really get to share this with but who are in my thoughts often. And that's my mother and my father, great people. [applause]\nI had great parents. Great parents. I know they're up there watching, I just felt that nice breeze. It's hot, but I just felt that nice breeze [applause]\nSo they're helping us out. And I just want to say thank you to both of them. Special, special people. I've had a great life and now I want to give back to the country that I love. It's time, we have to we have to give back, folks [applause]\nI've seen how the career of politicians, the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth. But we're just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country[applause]\nJustice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities, for every family that's born\u2014and you know that, they've been born into a situation in some case; they can't get out of it. We're going to get them out of it. We're going to get them out of it.\nWe have endless wars. Every community's hopes and dreams have been shattered and we're not going to let that happen. Our inner cities are going to come back and they're going to come back strong and your going to see what I mean. [applause]\nAnd the African-American community and the Hispanic community are really understanding what's going on and you see that right now. You see that right now in what's happening at the polls.\nWe're winning in Florida, we're winning in Ohio, we're winning in Iowa, in North Carolina. We're doing great in Pennsylvania. A lot of people are saying Pennsylvania's looking very good. So many different places.\nWe just got a poll with three up in Virginia. [applause]\nBut we are seriously up in Florida. That's very important [applause]\nAnd I will never, ever let you down. Real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing Obamacare, a disaster. [applause]\nA disaster. [applause]\nIt is a disaster. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. [booing]\nI will not tell you what the number is. I know the number very well, but I want you to leave happy. You don't want to hear the number, go home, relax, wake up good and strong tomorrow morning. You'll learn, you're not going to like it.\nIn the great state of Arizona, where we just left, the premiums are going up more than 116 percent. [booing]\nOver 90 percent of the counties in Florida and by the way, in the primaries, I won 66 out of 67 primaries. That's good. [applause]\nI was going to try and exaggerate and say I won them all, but I can't do that. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year, they're leaving. They're all leaving.\nIn Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare is a total catastrophe.\nYet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. [booing]\nI'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Florida, so important. [applause]\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government. [applause]\nAs you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into crooked Hillary Clinton. [applause]\nHillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and I don't see if you've watched her last few speeches over the last few days. She has become totally unhinged, unbelievable.\nWhat she's saying and what she's doing is actually, it's unbelievable. But she has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity.\nHillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI. Hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer and who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after, after, after, after receiving a congressional subpoena, think of that. [booing]\nUnbelievable. [booing]\nAnd as you know, they just found\u2014listen to this and I guess you know it, 650,000 e-mails. [booing]\nAnd I would say that classified, confidential, I think they're probably all over the place. I think they're\u2014I think they're gonna find a treasure trough. I can't even imagine.\nIn fact, they said well, this is OK they're duplicates. How could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place, right?\nYou know, when they deleted 33,000 I thought that was a lot. They have 650,000? Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat. [booing]\nInstead of reporting the breach. That's a big deal. You know, to me that's a big deal. Some people say oh, that's fine, that's a big deal. That's really\u2014that's a real cheater, OK? That's a cheater.\nAnd she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the DNC or be fired. [applause]\nBut that's a really big deal. And you notice, they never\u2014the dishonest prospect, the most dishonest. [booing]\nIf you notice, they never go after Hillary. They always talk about Donna Brazile, Donna Brazile didn't do it. But can you imagine if I got\u2014can you imagine, they gave the questions to Donald Trump before a debate. [applause]\nYou know it would be the electric chair. They'd reinstitute the electric chair. No.\nIt'd be headlines all over the world. This isn't headlines.\nI bring it up; it's brought up a little bit. But this isn't like a big deal. She got the debate questions and answers.\nBut she got the debate questions prior to a debate. Now, Bernie Sanders should be angry right? Shouldn't he be angry?\nNow, I'll tell you what. The system is rigged. The system is rigged.\nI've been saying it for a\u2014it's rigged, and we're gonna straighten it out. But the system is rigged. Hillary is not the victim; the American people are the victims of this system. [applause]\nSo corrupt in so many ways. And this is your one chance to change it because you know what?\nIn four years, not gonna happen. There's no way. The numbers won't work.\nIn four years, there's no way. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. And if she were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis.\nI mean before you go into phase two\u2014let's call what happened on Friday phase two. Phase one, she's so guilty. She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency.\nThat's why I say the system is rigged. She shouldn't be allowed to run. But I have a feeling in the 650,000 e-mails, they're gonna find things that you will not even believe.\nWho knows. 650,000 e-mails. No wonder she can't do anything.\nNo, no. How do you work? How do you do it?\n650,000. They'll have to explain that to us some day.\nBut they'll have some things in there that I can just imagine are going to be unbelievable. Hillary's likely to be under investigation for many years. Probably concluding in a criminal trial.\nOut today, WikiLeaks just came out with a new one. Just a little while ago. It's just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal between the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign, and the State Department.\nYou saw that. The e-mails show that the Assistant Attorney General who's involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to John Podesta and the Clinton campaign. Can you believe this? [booing]\nShe shouldn't be allowed to run.\nBy the way, behind me, the great Johnny Damon. The curse of the Yankees, but ultimately he helped the Yankees. Johnny Damon.\nStand up Johnny. [applause]\nNow, I'll tell ya. George Steinbrenner was a good friend of mine. Oh, he didn't like Johnny too much.\nThen he ultimately signed him and then he was fine. He did great.\nBut Johnny Damon was a champ. He was a winner. And he loves this area, you know that. My contract with the American voter begins with a tough ethics reform, and it ends\u2014I'll tell you what. We are going to end\u2014we have no choice.\nWe really have no choice\u2014government corruption. It's going to end. [applause]\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on November 8. We are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton with the support of crooked Hillary. [booing]\nAmerica has lost\u2014this is so hard to believe\u201470,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.\nAnother Bill and Hillary backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. They're leaving. We're going to stop it\nAnd you have an excellent governor, by the way. He's fighting hard for you folks. I don't know\u2014I don't know. All I can tell you is he is a worker, he is a worker, and he's fighting very hard. The theft of American prosperity will end and it'll end, I'll tell you. We are\u2014it is being stolen from us folks.\nIt is\u2014we have a one-way highway right into Mexico, right into other countries. And we're going to stop it. From now on, it's going to be America first. [applause]\nAmerica first. [applause]\nIt's going to be America first. [applause]\nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors. It's horrible what's happening to us. Our politicians don't have a clue, they don't know what they're doing\u2014or other things, OK. We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Killing our jobs. Our companies are leaving. Killing our jobs.\nWe will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. In Orlando, the murder rate doubled, you know that? Doubled last year. Can you believe it? We will support our police, and I met you police of Orlando, they are unbelievable people and they've been through a lot.\nI met the police and these are unbelievable people. We will bring this crime wave to an end. We will also keep our community safe from terrorism. Just a short time ago, Orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in American history during the Islamic terror attack on The Pulse nightclub.\nIt was also the worst attack on the LGBTQ community in our country's history. Can't let it happen, can't let it happen. Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent Syrian refugees pouring into our country. [booing]\nHer plan would mean generations of terrorism, radicalism, and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities.\nWhen I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refuge program. [applause]\nAnd we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community. [applause]\nGot to keep them out. And we'll build safe zones in Syria. We have to help the people. We're going to build safe zones, but the Gulf States haven't been doing their thing.\nAnd believe me, they have plenty of money. They'll help us, they'll fund it, I'm sure they'll be thrilled. They're going to be funding it, and that will be OK. We want to help people. But we have enough problems in this country. We don't need Orlando and problems. We don't need what happened in San Bernadino.\nWe don't need what's happening in Paris, in Nice and in Germany\u2014which is a disaster. We don't need it. We have enough problems right now, do we agree? We have enough problems. We don't need it. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause]\nAnd yes, we will build a great wall. [applause]\nWe received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers, great people. The officers that warned that Hillary's plan is the most quote, radical immigration proposal in United States history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, quote.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent, they wouldn't take them back.\nWe bring them to their countries\u2014murderers, drug dealers, gang members, we'd bring them to their countries and their countries would say: get them out, we're not taking them back. They call up the State Department, and the State Department under Hillary Clinton would say: oh, bring them back, we don't want to make waves.\nI guarantee you, whether it's four years or eight years, that will not happen once under a Trump administration. [applause]\nHillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities. Like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle\u2014incredible young woman\u2014was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.\nA Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately. We will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens\u2014the ones we just spoke about\u2014and we will save American lives. We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military. [applause]\nThat includes major new investments in resources from Pensacola Naval Air Station at MacDill Air Force Base. Have you ever heard of those places? Pretty good places. A lot of people here, lot of people. I'm honored to have the endorsement of 200\u2014more than that now, much more than that\u2014top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients.\nGreat people, I've met so many of them, they're incredible. Incredible people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spend $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never won and that never end. And it's now in worse shape than ever before.\nThe Middle East is a catastrophe, it's far worse off than had we spent nothing.\nThey've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home. And they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And it's\u2014it's disappearing. Our country, in a certain sense, is disappearing. Prosperity\u2014real prosperity is disappearing. We owe $20 trillion. Our trade deals, we lose $800 billion a year on trade. We have trade deficits. Think of that. Who negotiates these deals?\nYou know who does? Stupid people. Stupid people. [applause]\nWith very stupid leadership. Who, by the way, they campaign all the time. He's campaigning right now for crooked Hillary. [booing]\nWhy is he campaigning? She's under federal investigation, and we've got a president campaigning for her. And that's all he does is campaign. He ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to Mexico. And your military. [applause]\nI'll tell you what, first of all, she's got bigger problems. But four more years of Obama, we can't take it, folks. Four more years of ISIS, that's what it is. Four more years of no jobs.\nNow, she wants to start a shooting war in Syria and conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III. Russia is heavily armed, doesn't like her. Putin does not respect her, doesn't like her. What are we doing, folks? She's a mess.\nTo all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership. [applause]\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause]\nThank you. It's so beautiful over there. I just noticed the water. Let's go in for a swim. It's about 200 degrees out there.\nAnybody want to go swimming? Let's go. [applause]\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount. You know, we're already the highest-taxed nation in the world. She wants to increase your taxes, if you can believe that one.\nWe're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. Killing your companies. Killing them. One of the reasons they're leaving. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause]\nWe're going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans. They're not being taken care of. You know that. A lot of veterans here. We're going to take care of our veterans finally. They have been mistreated for many, many years.\nWe're going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nWe will save the Second Amendment which is, as you know, under tremendous siege. [applause]\nWe will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nWe will show the world that there is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. There's no dream\u2014no dream outside of our reach. We have all these people telling us what to do. Politicians\u2014they know nothing. I've dealt with them all my life, folks. All talk, no action.\nI have some friends that are politicians. So let me just say there's some good ones. OK? There are some good.\nI'll tell you what, you take a look at the media. These are the most dishonest people anywhere. [booing]\nThese are the most\u2014they\u2014the media\u2014the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live. They're a big fat cog in the\u2014and they never show the crowds. They never show what's happening.\nBut you know what? You hear\u2014when you hear 20,000, sometimes 30,000, when you hear people, sounds like you're at an Ohio State football game. [applause]\nBut they never show it. They never show it. [applause]\nThey never show it.\nPeople of Florida, we love you. All we have to do is cut our ties with these failed politicians of the past. Hillary is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are. [applause]\nWe're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters, of which we're finding out there are many. You probably heard over the last couple of weeks \"Texas is in play\"; \"Texas\u2014that Georgia is in play.\" And I'm saying, \"Gee, that's too bad.\"\nLet me tell you, they're setting records in Texas, and they're voting for Trump, just so you understand that. [applause]\nAnd they know it. [applause]\nBut when they see those numbers coming, they don't want to announce them. But we are winning almost everywhere. I think\u2014give us two more days, I think we're going to be winning everywhere. [applause]\nAnd I'm almost starting to think that the least important problem that Hillary has is the fact that we're winning. I think she's got perhaps bigger problems than even that. [applause]\nWe're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and nor Hillary's special interests. [applause]\nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future. [applause]\nI am asking you to dream big\u2014I got to dream big. Because with your vote, we are just\u2014can you believe this?\u2014six days away. Think of that. [applause]\nFrom the change you've been waiting for your entire life. [applause]\nWe're going to work together. We're going to vote. You're going to vote now or you're going to vote by the 8th. But you're going to vote.\nThank you. I love that guy. He's a tough guy, but he just screamed out, \"You're going to win.\" We're going to win. Thank you, man. Thank you. [applause]\nWe have great, great love.\nYou know, we're in a divided nation. We are a divided nation. We're not going to be divided. We're going to have such love in this country. We're going to have such love and such respect.\nTogether, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. [applause]\nWe will make America safe again. [applause]\nAnd we will make America great again. [applause]\nThank you very much. Thank you, folks. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. [applause]\nThank you. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you. [applause]\n","39":"\nThank you. Thank you. [applause]\nI love that sign, \"Blacks for Trump.\" I love that sign, thank you. [applause]\nThere are a lot of those signs. Thank you. \"Women for Trump.\" [applause]\n\"Hispanics for Trump.\" [applause]\nThere's one \"Women and Hispanics for Trump.\" [applause]\nThank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House 100 percent. [applause]\nWe're on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities and citizens, to you.\nThe system is rigged, remember that. The system is rigged. Right now it's rigged. We're going to change it.\nThere's some breaking news about that subject that we're going to discuss right now. As I mentioned yesterday, on of the\u2014and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it.one of the top Department of Justice officials involved in the e-mail investigation, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kassig [booing]\nis a close associate of John Podesta. The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta, who by the way said Hillary Clinton has terrible instincts on WikiLeaks, described him as the man who kept him, Podesta, out of jail.\nKadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now, today, in a newly released e- mail\u2014through WikiLeaks again\u2014we learned that Kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the Clinton campaign and that [booing]\nright? And that Kadzik said quote \"It will be a while before the State Department posts the e-mails.\" Remember they were waiting for the e-mails. [booing]\nPodesta forwarded the e-mails to Clinton's top staff and said, additional chances for mischief. These are the people that want to run our country, folks. [booing]\nThe spread of political agendas into the Justice Department\u2014there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history\u2014is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country. But with your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system, and deliver justice. So, show up early and vote. Show up early. You know, the lines are incredible. The polls are all saying we're going to win Florida. Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we're slightly behind. You got to get\u2014we don't want to blow this.\nThis is the one chance we have, it'll never happen again. It's not going to happen. In four years, it's not going to happen\u2014it can't happen again. This is a movement like we have never seen in this country before. These crowds, the enthusiasm, the love. [applause]\nGot to get out and vote. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause]\nAnd Hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive. She's doubling down. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida\u2014sorry to tell you this, folks\u2014are going to experience a massive, massive double digit premium hike. [booing]\nNow, I know what that hike is, but I want you to leave here happy, I want you to be happy people. I want you to think about the future after we take back the White House so I'm not going to tell you what your hike is, but let me just say it's going to be very substantial. And Obamacare doesn't work on top of everything else. As an example, in the great state of Arizona\u2014which I just left\u2014premiums are going up more than 116 percent. It's out of control.\nOver 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year. Lots of luck in your negotiation. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof. Wasn't supposed to be like this, but I said it was going to be like this before it was passed because I understand how business works.\nObamacare never had a chance. It's a catastrophe. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive. It's going to go up a lot. People aren't going to be able to afford it so I'm not sure that it matters, they're just not going to be able to pay. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States. [applause]\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has\u2014did you hear about this little event? The FBI re-opening the investigation. [applause]\nThey're re-opening the investigation into Crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing]\nCrooked Hillary, she's crooked. [booing]\nLock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\nShe is a crooked one, there's no question. Crooked Hillary Clinton, you know that term has really stuck, everyone's calling her\u2014has anyone seen Crooked Hillary Clinton today? [applause]\nThat's going to be a great term for a president, right? Boy, oh boy, what a mess. This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. And now it's been reported that there are FBI inquiries probing virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner circle and many of the things she's done over the years. It's about time. Remember, it's a rigged system, remember it's about time.\nShe wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she really has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. The woman screaming exactly, exactly, it is exactly. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the State Department and who ripped off the people of Haiti, the people of Haiti were ripped off. [booing]\nAnd I met with the people of Little Haiti. Anybody here?\nThese are great people, great, thank you.\nHillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. [booing]\nAnd she's the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena. [booing]\nShe also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by Donna Brazile [booing]\nand then used those debate questions to cheat. It's cheating, the worst level. Instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach. So she got the answers, cheating. She got the questions, cheating. And then she\u2014rather than reporting them, rather than saying this shouldn't be happening\u2014she used them against Bernie Sanders.\nCan you imagine. she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy I don't think it mattered. We won those debates. [applause]\nDid you see her at the end of the debates? Folks, she was exhausted. You know what she did? She immediately went home and went to sleep. [applause]\nHillary is not the victim, and the American people, frankly, are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way. But this is your chance finally to change it, November 8th. Now in Florida's case, earlier. Now, just so you understand, record turnout, unbelievable numbers, unbelievable. We're doing great with the African-American community. [applause]\nWe're doing great with the Hispanic community. [applause]\nAnd the lines are four, five and six blocks long. They've never seen anything like it. And the polls have just come up. We're way up in Florida. I shouldn't say that, because I want you to go vote. [applause]\nOK, ready? We're going to pretend we're down. We're down. Pretend, right? We'll pretend we're down. No, we got to win. We got to win big. We got to beat her. Got to beat her. We're up in Ohio, we're up in Iowa, we're up in North Carolina. [applause]\nI think we're doing great in Pennsylvania; from what I hear. [applause]\nFolks, you're going to be so proud. You're going to be so proud. We're going to make America great again. You're going to be so happy and you're going to be so proud of your country again.\nIf Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. [booing]\nHaven't we just been through a lot with the Clintons, right? Remember when he was impeached for lying? He can't practice law. He doesn't have the right to practice law. Didn't we just go through this? And the last thing we need is another four years of Obama. That's the last thing. [booing]\nAnd this will be worse. That means ISIS, that means high taxes, that means bad health care, that means no border. Without a border, we don't have a country. The work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected. She'll be in court for her entire tenure and she'll be convicted. Because look, the first time\u2014I mean, frankly, forget about this time. The first time she gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes everything? There shouldn't have been a second time.\nBut I have respect that the FBI has given it a second chance. And this time, I have no doubt that in that 650,000 e-mails\u2014did you see where they said, oh, we're not worried. They're duplicates. How can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with? [booing]\nSo today, I guess WikiLeaks, it sounds like, is going to be dropping some more, and if we met tomorrow, I'll tell you about it tomorrow, but one beauty that's been caught was, and this was just recently, newly released, where they say having a dump. We're having a dump of all of those e-mails.\nIn another communication, Bill Clinton's chief of staff says foreign government\u2014right, this should be another one. Just like swamp\u2014you know the swamp little statement\u2014this one, this one. Do you remember what it is? Right? All the money is in, right? They said all the money is in. They're talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets. They said all the money is in. [booing]\nThis is what is running for office. Honestly, she should be ashamed of herself. She should be ashamed of herself.\nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government. That includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Makes sense. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]\nGonna drain the swamp. We're gonna drain the swamp, folks. We're gonna drain that swamp. [applause]\nAnother important issue for Americans is integrity in journalism. These people are among the most dishonest people I've ever met, spoken to, done business with. These are the most dishonest people. [booing]\nThere has never been dishonesty\u2014there has never been dishonesty like we've seen in this election. There's never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like we've seen in this election. Don't worry, they won't spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds. They won't do that. [booing]\nThe very talented Michael Goodwin of the New York Post just wrote today that 2016 presidential race will mark the low-water mark of journalism that is worthy\u2014think of it\u2014of the First Amendment. Never before have so many media organizations, old and new, abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president. [booing]\nIt's unbelievable. It's un-honest.\nFor instance, we have a great story. We give it out to the media. They'll make it look as bad as possible\u2014as bad as possible. Parenthetically\nSo sad. Parenthetically and very sadly, earnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year. They just announced that. So bad. I feel so badly for them. Just announced\u201497 percent. Oh, they're doing great. And then they tell you who to vote for, you know? Who to vote for. They want crooked Hillary.\nThis isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world.\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs. [applause]\nRight now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. Forty-three percent of African- American school-aged children live in poverty. Thirty-two percent of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty.\nThis is America, this is the United States, this is unacceptable. As your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. [applause]\nWe will replace decades of failure with generations of success. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. [booing]\nAnd here's a number that you should remember because it's not even a believable number, and it's correct. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs left in the history of the world. Our jobs are going to Mexico, our jobs are going to other countries. China and others are making our product. We don't make it anymore. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. [applause]\nMy second home, you know that, I'm here all the time. My second home, great place.\nThe theft of American prosperity will end. So they are stealing our prosperity, horribly stealing our prosperity. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we'll stand up to foreign product dumping all over the place. [applause]\nCurrency manipulation by China and many other countries and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that's going on all over the world against us. We will also immediately stop the job-killing, Trans- Pacific Partnership, a disaster. [applause]\nAnd Hillary wants it to happen, she called it the gold standard, then she rejected it. But she's going to approve it. Then she lied during the debate, right? She lied. [booing]\nShe lied during the debate. She said she never called it the gold standard, she lied. And she lied about the line in the sand, right? She lied. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause]\nWe will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations [applause]\nand use that money to support America's vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources. We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. We don't even know who's doing what with the money. We're gonna spend the money here. We're gonna work on our own environment. [applause]\nThat includes repairing the Herbert Hoover Dike at Lake Okeechobee and protecting the Florida Everglades. [applause]\nWe will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation [applause]\nA terrible tragedy today has occurred in Iowa. You read, you saw. Early this morning, two Iowa police officers, outstanding, outstanding people, were murdered, ambushed, ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars. We send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen. I just left Iowa, most beautiful place. The treatment was so incredible, the crowds, the police officers were so incredible the job they did. Now two of them are dead. An attack on our police is an attack on all of us. [applause]\nLaw enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos, you have to remember that. [applause]\nAccording to the national law enforcement officers, Memorial Fund, firearm related police were up 48 percent this year, the highest they've ever been. And there have been 14 ambush style attacks this year alone, never had anything like this.\nAnd what it is, is a lack of respect for our nation, it's a lack of respect for our leadership. To all the great men and women of law enforcement I want you to know, we're with you, we support you and we will stand by you. [applause]\nWe will restore law order and justice in America\u2014justice. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you, so good luck to the people of Iowa.\nWe will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep America safe from terrorism. [applause]\nHillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our countries. [booing]\nHer plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities. When I'm president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program[applause]\nand we will keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of your community. [applause]\nNow, we all have heart and we're gonna build safe zones and we're gonna have some of the Gulf States that have nothing but money, they'll put up the money, we'll lead it, we'll build safe zones.\nBut we have enough problems in our country. She wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now. She wants to increase that number by 550 percent.\nAnd then, you wonder why Podesta says, she has bad instincts and you wonder why Bernie Sanders says, she's got bad judgment, they're right. She's got bad judgment, personally I think she's a very unstable person, if you wanna really know the truth. [applause]\nAnd we're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare, but you wanna know something? Honestly, I think for herself she's got much bigger problems right now than Obamacare. She's got bigger problems. [applause]\nLet's see what's on all those e-mails that they just found, see what's on those e-mails.\nThank you.\nIt's too bad those cameras aren't turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside, isn't it too bad? [applause]\nThey don't do it. But you know, if Hillary speaks and there's 30 people in the line they say, the crowd is massive. [booing]\nShe's never had a crowd like this in her life. [applause]\nPresident Obama shouldn't be campaigning for any longer, it's really a conflict, right? He oughta be working on jobs, on the border, on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked Hillary Clinton, is what he oughta be doing. [applause]\nHe's in North Carolina, but we're going to North Carolina right after this, so. [applause]\nBut we have a few more today in Florida, and we have massive crowds. There's something happening. They're not reporting it. Katie, you're not reporting it, Katie. [applause]\nBut there's something happening, Katie. There's something happening, Katie. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build the wall. [applause]\nThank you. [applause]\nWe've received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. [applause]\nThey tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst it's ever been. Now, in all fairness, people probably figure that I'm going to win. [applause]\nSo, they're racing across the border. I don't know. I'm sorry to do this to you, folks. [applause]\nHillary has pledged totally open borders, meaning you don't have a country anymore. And she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in San Francisco where[booing]\nRight? Where Kate Steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant. [booing]\nThe immigration officers warn that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives. And I believe that. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back. [booing]\nCountless innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Last year, as an example, 17-year-old Starlett Pitts, her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their Lee High Acres home by an illegal immigrant. The killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery. And the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated. They were begging. He was released from custody pending his court appearance, enabling him to commit murder.\nA Trump administration will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and save American lives. [applause]\nAnd I want to thank, by the way, I see all these signs\u2014\"Cubans for Trump.\" Cubans. I love Cubans. [applause]\nSo they gave me last week the Bay of Pigs Association, right? You know. They gave me their award last week and it was a great honor. And we're gonna fight very hard for the Cubans and we're gonna fight very, very hard for the Hispanics because they have not been properly taken care of.\nWhat's happened with the Hispanic population in our country is not right. What's happened with the inner cities of our country, the African-American community, the Hispanic community, is very, very unfair. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you.\nWe're going to take care of it. The crime is horrible, the education is terrible, and you can't get a job. We're going to fix the inner cities\u2014we're going to fix the inner cities.\nThank you, fellows, that's so good. Blacks for Trump. That's so nice.\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause]\nThat includes total support for homestead air reserve base. A Trump administration will stand in solidarity with the suffering people of Cuba and Venezuela all surrounding Dural\u2014all surrounding Dural against the oppression of the Castro and Maduro regimes, you know what I'm talking about.\nWe will cancel Obama's one-sided Cuban deal made by Executive Order. If we do not get the deal we want, and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve[applause]\nincluding protecting religious and political freedom, right? I'm honored to have the endorsement of over 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. [applause]\nYou know it's really called peace through strength. Peace through strength, that's what we're going to have, well, hopefully. Have to get rid of ISIS\u2014we're going to get rid of ISIS, don't worry, we're getting rid of ISIS. But we have to get to rebuild our country.\nWe've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East\u2014six trillion dollars. And it's in far worse shape, by a factor of 10, from when we started. Six trillion\u2014we lost lives, the most incredible, great people.\nOur new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought disaster to Iraq and Syria and Libya. And she empowered Iran, remember, she's got bad judgment. And she unleashed ISIS, came right out of the vacuum. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Frankly, it could lead to World War III and she has no sense. She's got no instinct, but that's decided\nHillary and our failed Washington establishment, they've spent that six trillion dollars. I mean, I'd love to have that money back, but I'd much rather have all those lives back\u2014rather have all those lives. [applause]\nLove to have those lives back. But the Middle East is in bad shape folks, and it's getting worse, totally getting worse. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And these are foreign wars that we don't win\u2014we don't win. We don't win anymore, we don't win with trade, we don't win with wars, we don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again, you watch. We're going to start. [applause]\nTo all Americans I say it's time for new leadership. Just think about what can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. [applause]\nAnd she is going to raise your taxes very substantially, I think you know that. [booing]\nWe will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, cancel every illegal Obama executive order, rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. [applause]\nProvide school choice and put an end to Common Core; we're bringing our education local. [applause]\nSupport the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nWe're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege [applause]\nand appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nClinton wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington. I wonder if she's going to be there much longer. What do you think? [booing]\nI don't think so. I don't know. I'm not sure she's going to be there. But she wants\u2014she wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this great country. [applause]\nI'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. [applause]\nThere is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics, certainly not the media. [booing]\nHillary has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. Look at her record. She's the candidate of yesterday; we are the\u2014right? Is that right?\nWe are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and independents and first time voters. And believe me, there are a lot of first time voters that are standing on line right now. [applause]\nWe're asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. And I understand the other side very well. I've been there for a long time, but I love our country and I understand what has to be done. We are going in the wrong direction, and if we keep going in this direction, we won't have a country any longer. [booing]\nWe're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.\nWith your vote, we are just\u2014think of it\u2014six days away. [applause]\nThis started on June 16th of last year. It's a long time. Seems like a long time ago. But we're six days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. It'll never happen again. It'll never, ever happen. It's not going to happen in four years. When I see Cubans for Trump, it'll never happen again. I'm telling you. This whole thing will never happen again.\nThere's never been a movement like this in the history of our country\u2014there's never been a movement like this.\nThank you. Thank you.\nThere has never been a movement like this in the history of our country\u2014it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump have said, it's the single greatest phenomena the have ever seen. We have to close the deal. We have to close\u2014get out and vote. November 8th fine, better if you vote now.\nMaybe you don't feel good November 8th, you don't want to get outta bed, you gotta get up, you gotta vote.\nTogether we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. [applause]\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]\nGet out and vote. God bless you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]\n","40":"\nThank you very much. Thank you. [applause]\nI would like to thank my incredible running mate, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. [applause]\nAnd I love you, too. [applause]\nWe have a lot of very enthused and excited people in this campaign. So I really do thank all of you. [applause]\nI would like to thank my incredible running mate, Mike Pence, on the tremendous job he's done. And he's a fantastic leader and a leader on health care...[applause]\nI'd also like to thank Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]\nNot only a great man, and I don't say that about a lot of people, but one of the toughest competitors I've ever faced. People don't know how well he did during those primaries. And I just kept looking back. And I just kept seeing him. And boy, I'll tell you.\nBut even more importantly, he's a brilliant physician and I hope he will be very much involved with my administration in the coming years. [applause]\nThank you.\nI'd also like to recognize the distinguished members of Congress in attendance who have all been at the forefront of health care, and have been so helpful to me: Congresswoman Ellmers, Lummis; Congressmen Price, Harris, Burgess and DesJarlais. [applause]\nAnd let me give a special thanks to Senator Barrasso, a terrific doctor, a Senate leader, who did incredible work chairing our platform committee, just unbelievable work. So I want to thank you very much, Senator. Fantastic job. [applause]\nAnd been very, very loyal to what we're doing and what we represent. So thank you, Senator. When we win on November 8th...[applause]...and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. [applause]\nI will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me, for you and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. The president said if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\nWhich may go down as one of the great political lies of the century. Even the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation. There were Democrats that were very much against it, but they believed him and they approved it. No one ever read, or certainly very few people, the 2,700 page bill. To this day, nobody understands it.\nThe Obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit Obamacare premium hikes everywhere, all throughout the country. Here in Pennsylvania, premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent and that's nothing compared to what will happen in the future. Of course, in the future, I'm president, there won't be Obamacare, so you won't have to worry about it. [applause]\nThat means parents won't have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids. In the great state of Arizona, a wonderful place I just left, premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent. Other states are going up more than 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. Deductibles can go to $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, even $15,000. In other words, your health care won't even be usable. You're paying all this money, you won't even get to use it.\nPeople all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which, by the way, is a first in American history. This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life.\nOne-third of the counties -- think of this, one-third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that. That includes Philadelphia, where I went to school. The Associated Press found that some of the 440,000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation. The people of Philadelphia. Insurers are leaving, premiums are soaring, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof. Workers' hours are being cut, hiring is frozen -- totally frozen -- and wages are being slashed. Obamacare means higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. She wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America. If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever.\nIt's one of the single most important reasons why we must win on November 8th, we must win. [applause]\nThank you. [applause]\nThank you.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\nOur replacement plan includes health savings accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage Medicaid dollars so much better. We will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families. It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost.\nWe've also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every American family. And while this is really -- thank you. [applause]\nWhile this is really a meeting and that's what it is, it's a meeting of very, very special people and I appreciate you all being here. But it's a meeting talking about health care and Obamacare. Our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs. We have to do it. [applause] We're gonna bring back your manufacturing, we're gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a whole\nOur jobs are being stolen. Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. The city of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the Word Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.\nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, believe me. And we have the greatest negotiators in the world. We will use our great negotiators. [applause]\nWe'll have a fair deal, but we'll have a deal that goes in two directions, not one direction, right into Mexico and these other places. [applause]\nAnd stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior. [applause]\nWe are going to bring manufacturing jobs, lots of jobs, back to Pennsylvania. We're gonna do it. And it won't even be difficult. [applause]\nWe're going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners. Our miners have been mistreated horribly. [applause]\nWe will be producing clean coal, oil, natural gas and shale energy. [applause]\nWe're also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt, so badly hurt. [applause]\nWhose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state, and frankly, all over this country, by China and other countries. Nobody has been treated worse than these workers, but that will change on January 20th of next year, believe me. It will change. [applause]\nWe're also going to provide the children of the state with school choice. So important. [applause]\nThat means parents can spend and take care of their children, but they can send their kids to public school, to private, to chartered, to magnet, to religious or to home school. It's going to be their right and it's going to be something that's so, so good for your children and for the education of your children. [applause]\nWe will also totally eliminate Common Core and bring education local. We're gonna bring it local. [applause]\nPeople do not like Common Core in this country, that I can tell you. [laughter]\nAnd our system is failing, so it's obviously not working. We're gonna eliminate Common Core, we're gonna bring it local.\nOur tax plan will provide a 35 percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids. As an example, you have two kids, a 35 percent cut so desperately needed. Our middle class has not been properly respected, that I can tell you. [applause]\nWe will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create tax-free childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families. [applause]\nWe will eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. When did we ever need it more? Greatest people on Earth in our military, but it's badly depleted. [applause]\nThank you. People love this country, don't they? Isn't it beautiful, right? Beautiful. [applause]\nIt's a beautiful thing to watch and see. And I see it all over the country, no matter where we go. And every time I say we are going to rebuild our depleted military, it's always the same response. It's an incredible response. [applause]\nOur Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I, think of that. Smallest since World War I. And rebuilding it will require a national effort. That's why I will ask my Secretary of the Navy to review facilities like the Philadelphia Navy Yard, I know it well. [applause]\nWith a long history of service to our Navy, proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again. [applause]\nTo recruit master craftsmen this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the Philadelphia Navy Yard.\nVocational training is a great thing. We don't do it anymore. We don't do it anymore. [applause]\nAnd I must tell you, so often in going to college right down the road and going to college, we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that weren't as brilliant in that way but were brilliant, incredible when it came to fixing a motor, when it came to fixing something that I had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded. And we don't do that anymore. Vocational training for our country is so, so, so important. [applause]\nAnd just in closing -- and they loved it. They loved it. They didn't want to be doing what I was doing. They loved it. They were so good at it and they loved it. So vocational training, we're going to start it up big league. [applause]\nWe will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country. I'm not a politician. My only special interest is you, the American people. That's why I've done this. [applause]\nThank you very much. [applause]\nThe guiding rule of the political class in Washington, D.C. is that they are looking out only for themselves, only for themselves with the exception of these few people. [laughter]\nI feel guilty as I'm looking, they're staring me in the eyes. So I have to say with these exceptions. They will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense. I'm running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the American people to create generations of success. I'm running... [applause]\nI'm running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities. We need safety. And by the way, our law enforcement officials, these are great, great people. [applause]\nThank you. And we are going to give great prosperity to our economy. I want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization, the inner cities. [applause]\nAnd I've been working with so many African-American groups. These are such incredible people. We've been talking about it, working on it. We're going to bring jobs into the inner cities. We're going to bring safety. We're going to bring education, good, good schools into the inner cities. [applause]\nThe spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody. And it's gonna work. It's gonna work. You watch. Americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day. But politicians for the most part really mean another decade, because that's what they're talking about. Enough waiting. Time is now.\nBut to accomplish our goals, we must cut our ties with the small, bitter, petty politics of the past. We must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end, that we never win and that have made us far less safe. Think of it. [applause]\nThink of all the money that's spent, all the lives that have been lost.\nAnd we're far less safe today than we were before we started. They've left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.\nIt's time for new leadership. [applause]\nI've led a great life and I truly love our country. So now I want to give back to the country that's been so good to me, that's why I'm doing this. [applause]\nAll I see everywhere I travel in this nation, and I've been everywhere, is untapped potential waiting to be realized. The people are amazing, the people are amazing. If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach. [applause]\nIf we stopped believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves, then anything, anything is possible. [applause]\nI'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country. [applause]\nThat is how we will truly make America great again. [applause]\nThank you very much, thank you everybody. God bless you, thank you. [applause]\n","41":"\nHello, Kent State! And Happy Halloween everybody! It's great to be back in Ohio \u2013 even if, even if the World Series is making life very stressful for Cubs fans everywhere.\nI want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction, and for his service to our nation. I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote. I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program. In particular, let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown, such a great senator, my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan, State Representative John Boccieri, State Representative Kathleen Clyde, and let me thank the Kent Clarks, the acapella group that sang during the pre-program!\nMy friends, we are about to enter the final week of this election, so I wanted to come back to Ohio, one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country, to talk about what's at stake in this election. But let me start with this. I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a good question!\nAnd first of all, for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand and as I've said, I'm not making excuses. I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means, they should look at them. And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here. And they said it wasn't even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this.\nNow what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America. And did any of you see the debates? Well, I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country. And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said. I am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, 'Then why are we making them?' And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East.\nAnd if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who'll stop these crazy ideas, remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because he said and I quote, 'I have a very good brain.' He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. No, he does not. And of course, the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putin's allies.\nSo, in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future. I started saying last June, I believe, that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. And I've got to tell you, I did not take any pleasure in saying that. I have known, I have known for years now people who ran for President, Republicans and Democrats. And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats, but I never doubted their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. That's as serious as it gets.\nSo today, I want to talk about our national security. Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions. And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election. And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries?\nWe'll start with nuclear weapons. Now, I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don't think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair. When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should, and I quote, 'not have his finger on the button,' then this is a topic that can't be avoided. And as I've said, Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons. He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world, the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped. And when a few more countries go nuclear, their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well.\nOne of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program. But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump. 'Good luck, enjoy yourselves, folks,' was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia.\nI wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people. These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.\nTo talk so casually, so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling. President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared, and this is a quote from President Reagan, 'some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us.' That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age.\nSo what would he think about Donald Trump, who says he wants to be, and I quote, 'unpredictable' about using the most powerful weapons ever produced? And here's the thing with nuclear weapons \u2013 as Bruce told you, when the President gives the order, that's it. There's no veto for Congress, no veto by the Joint Chiefs. The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire. And that can take as little as four minutes. That's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal.\nEarlier you heard from one of them, Bruce Blair, and his story is worth remembering. In 1973, Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana. His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order. Then one night in October, as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East, the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war. Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world, Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty. They unlocked the safe, took out the launch codes and the keys, and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them. Then they waited for the final order from the President. Thankfully, it never came. But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump, and sees his hair-trigger temper, and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night. As I've said many times, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\nAnd that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis? We've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. When he's confronted with his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear, racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet. And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.\nNow thankfully, he's never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country. But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself. Donald is a New Yorker, and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruz's attacks in a debate. And then he invoked the days after 9\/11, when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other. And I couldn't agree more. That's why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9\/11. After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell, he called in to a New York TV station. And even on that horrible day, when thousands of people lost their lives, he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now, because the towers had fallen, a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan. What kind of a person brags at a moment like that? I'll tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief.\nFor me, I take this very personally, my friends. Because I was one of New York's senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9\/11. He and I were on the ground the very next day, meeting with the Governor, the Mayor, emergency officials. And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero. The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see. Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers. They had all lost friends. In a makeshift command center, we were briefed on the damage, and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York, and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe.\nThat's what I did for eight years as a senator. I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed. And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that. Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted. They happen. I'll tell you a quick story. It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration. And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room. And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table, and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side. And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration.\nSo even before we were sworn in to do our jobs, we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision. It really matters what your experience has, what your values are, whether you can be counted on to make that decision. You learn a lot about people in moments like that. And as I sat there with the pressure on, having to think through in my own head, how we evaluated this intelligence, how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington.\nWe made the decision to go forward, obviously. Some of you might have been there. But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there. So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis, who would you trust? Who will listen to good advice, keep a level head and make the right call? Because that's the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief.\nNow let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us. Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? Now this may seem like an easy question. If you got it on an exam, I think you'd be able to answer it. But apparently it's hard for Donald. He has picked fights with our friends. I mean the President of Mexico, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, pretty much the entire nation of Japan\u2026 and he even picked a fight with the Pope. And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership. He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square. Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia.\nHe has called NATO, quote, 'obsolete.' Obsolete? NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And it's based on something called Article V, which says, 'An attack on one is an attack on all.' And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9\/11. We still have NATO allies fighting side by side, working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan. They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. Now we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back?\nAnd by the way\u2014right now, our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe. They're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere. And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops, they share the risks and burdens. Now they're moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression.\nTreating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City \u2013 hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe. And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China, which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail. But maybe that's the point. Because what's most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider \u2013 is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAs former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it, and I quote her, 'We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.' Michael Morell, who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here, has said that Putin is manipulating Donald. Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB. He knows he can use flattery to get into Donald's head -- to make Donald the Kremlin's puppet. And It seems to be working.\nDonald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants, from Ukraine to Syria and beyond. He's even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama. And it gets worse. The U.S. intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government, which means Putin, is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election.\nSo ask yourself, why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President? Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him, or the fact that he's promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies, or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin? Since Donald still won't release his tax returns, and don't hold your breath, we don't know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing.\nAnd we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country. A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election. That should scare everyone, Democrat, Republican, and Independent. With the election just eight days away, this can't wait any longer. Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates. The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election.\nWhen you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump, because he would be \u2013 in their words \u2013 'the most reckless President in American history.' It's no surprise that not a single former President, Secretary of State or Defense, or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him. It's no surprise that Bob Gates, who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, 'beyond repair\u2026 stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government\u2026 temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform\u2026 unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.'\nI hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country, our children and our grandchildren. And who is best to do that. So make no mistake, that really is what is on the ballot this year. It's not just my name and Donald Trump's name. It's our future. Our security. Our values. It's who we are as a country.\nDonald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. But the good news is: There's another vision for America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified. And it is big-hearted, not small-minded. It's about lifting people up, not tearing each other down. It's a vision that says, as I believe in my heart that we are stronger together.\nMillions of people across our country are standing up and saying: We believe in an America that is great because it is good. That is Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Because we believe in an America where women are respected. An America where veterans are honored, parents are supported, and workers are paid fairly \u2026 an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong\u2026. an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values\u2026 where everyone counts and everyone has a place. Where the American dream is big enough for everyone.\nThis goes way beyond policies and partisanship. We're talking about what it really means to be an American in the 21st century. About the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls, kids and grandkids. It turns out, if you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics, eventually you hit something hard and true. A foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans \u2013 basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency.\nThat's something to defend \u2013 and to build on. And, in the end, that's what this election is all about. Here in Ohio, you can make the difference. Early voting has already begun. So now is the time. Every phone call you make, every door you knock, moves us forward. You can go to hillaryclinton.com, and sign up to volunteer. Or text J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6 to do the same.\nSometimes -- if you have studied history -- you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States. And it truly is in your hands, as it should be. When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you will be able to say: I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America. A place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of America are still ahead of us. Particularly young people who I believe absolutely should help make that future!\nSo let's come together, let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us. And we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you.\n","42":"\nSecretary Clinton: \"Thank you so much! Wow, it is great to be back in Cincinnati. What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river. I am grateful to all of you. I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby, and with all of you, because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes.\nAre you ready to work hard in this election and win it? Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? I've known Ted a long time. He is a champion for workers and families. He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages. And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done, breaking through the gridlock in Washington. And this is important: unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nI also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials, including my friend, the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, from across the river in Kentucky. And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today. I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work, to do everything they can to help save lives in America.\nYou know, as Gabby says every day when she goes out, fight, fight, fight. And fight she does. She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together \u2013 to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country. And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures. And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.\nYou know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns, there are ups and there are downs. And my mother, who had a really difficult life, she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign. Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up. And throughout this campaign, I have stayed focused on one thing: you \u2013 your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night. Because that's really what this election is all about. It's not about the noise and the distractions. It's about what kind of country we want for our kids, and what kind of president can help get us there.\nI have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America. And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election.\nNow, earlier today, I was up at Kent State, a great university, and I told them about some of the reasons why I think it's really important to get everybody out to vote in this election. But I started by saying that there's this new email story about \u2013 why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a really good question. But I want you to know \u2013 look, I've said repeatedly I made a mistake, I'm not making any excuses, but I will tell you this. If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers, by all means, go ahead, look at them. And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year, right? It wasn't even a close call, and I think most people have moved on. They're looking and focused on, okay, who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?\nDid any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates? Well, I am \u2013 I got a little bit of a chance. I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do, and then weigh that against my opponent, what he's done and said. I am running against someone who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, \"Then why are we making them?\" He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. He's mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Now, if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas, remember this. When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because, and I quote, \"I have a very good brain.\" He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. [Booing.] No, Donald, you don't. And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin, and their allies.\nSo in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election. Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.\nI have to tell you, it does not give me any pleasure saying that. It's not a small thing. I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats. And look, I've had my disagreements with Republicans. I might have disagreed on policies or principles, but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office. Donald Trump is different, and that's why there is so much at stake in this election. He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges \u2013 the challenge posed by slavery \u2013 and we fought a civil war. But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together.\nI will tell you this. I want to bring not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents, people who vote for me and people who vote against me, together. Because I have a very different vision of America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive. It's big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down. It's a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together. And America is great because America is good. Never forget that. Yes, we have our flaws; of course, we're only humans. But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world. So we want an America where women are respected \u2013 where our veterans are honored \u2013 where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly. And we believe in an America where marriage is a right, and discrimination is wrong. An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody. So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher.\nWhen I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck. It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students. And I thought to myself, well, I'm not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security. And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys. A launch officer. And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.\nAnd even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother him. \"Good luck. Enjoy yourselves, folks,\" is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he even knows that a single \u2013 a single \u2013 nuclear warhead can kill millions of people? That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should, and I quote, \"not have his finger on the button.\" And when it comes to handling a crisis, we've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation \u2013 when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he's challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he's confronted by his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. [Cries of \"No!\"] Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. I hope you'll think about that when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.\nAnd think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns. Thousands more are injured. It's an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we've seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.\nBut here's what I want to say. If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute. This can't go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.\nAnd look. There is a very clear difference. Donald Trump won't stand up to the gun lobby. He's sold out to them. In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone. And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obama's actions to strengthen criminal background checks. Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol. He's even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms. How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?\nSo I have stood up to the gun lobby for years, which is why they are running all of these ads against me. And I will stand up to them as president. I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because we've got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives.\nI will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you, whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people, to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. That's how I was raised. I was raised to believe that if you work hard \u2013 and I believe in hard work \u2013 you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. And I will never ever quit on you. When I tell you I'm going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don't care what the political or other barriers are. We're going to find a way over, under, around, or through until we get it done. I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now. Remember, when our opponents go low, we go high. We're not going to be distracted. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters. And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count.\nNow, the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple. They've announced it. Their strategy is: get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home. It's all part of his scorched-earth campaign, but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it. And it goes against everything we stand for. So if you're as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said, insulting not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military \u2013 I mean, the list goes on and on. It's almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does.\nSo you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history. We need more Americans to vote. And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because we're already seeing record turnout. Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election. And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio. There is no doubt if we vote, we win. So, please, if you haven't voted early, please do so. And please get your friends and your family, everybody you know to vote. Take people to vote with you. Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there.\nMake sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun. And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because, make no mistake, whatever issue you care about \u2013 I've only mentioned a few tonight, but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot. Now, it may be my name and my opponent's name, but where we stand on these issues, what we've done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot. The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake. Fighting climate change and clean, renewable-energy jobs are at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake. So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th.\nAudience Member: Happy.\nSecretary Clinton: Happy. I think that's the right answer. But just suppose, just suppose you go to bed early. Suppose you go to bed early. Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn't make calls or knock on doors. I want you to imagine. So you get up early on the morning of the 9th. And you log on to the news to find out, hey, what's going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio, and you hear.\nAudience Member: No!\nI want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what we're for, not what we're against. But I also think it's prudent to imagine what could happen if we don't do our part. And when in the future somebody asks you, maybe your kids or your grandkids, 'What did you do when everything was on the line?' I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.'\nLet's go out and, in these next eight days, do everything we can to make it clear we're going after the kind of future that includes everybody. We're going to build this economy: new jobs, rising wages. We're going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt. We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids. So if we build that future together, we will be able to say we were part of making sure that America's best days are still ahead of us. And we will prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.\nThank you all.\"\n","43":"\nIn 8 days, we are going to win the Great State of Michigan and we are going to win back the White House.\nLet me start today by making a very important promise. When we win on November 8th, I am going to bring back your jobs. The long nightmare of jobs leaving Michigan will be coming to an end. We will make Michigan the economic envy of the world once again.\nThe political class in Washington has betrayed you. They've uprooted your jobs, and your communities, and shipped your wealth all over the world. They put new skyscrapers up in Beijing while your factories in Michigan crumbled.\nI will end the theft of American prosperity. I will fight for every last Michigan job.\nBecause, when we win, it's going to be America First.\nSo you have to make sure you get in your absentee ballots, and to get to the polls on November 8th. You have to vote. Vote with all of your heart and soul. Show the whole world how much you love Michigan, and how much you love America, by voting to take back the jobs that have been stolen from you. I'm asking for the vote of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and First-Time voters who want great jobs, safe neighborhoods, and a government that works for the people.\nI'm asking you to believe in America once again.\nBut to bring back your jobs, we must also immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\nIt's just been announced that Michigan residents are going to experience crushing double-digit premium hikes.\nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said \"the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.\"\nHillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive \u2013 in fact, much more expensive. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Michigan.\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government.\nAs you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and has discovered another 650,000 emails. Hillary lied under oath when she said she turned over all of her work-related emails \u2013 just one more lie out of so many.\nThis is the biggest scandal since Watergate. Hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she has brought this all onto herself. Hillary is the one who set-up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity.\nHillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt Pay-For-Play scheme at the State Department \u2013 and now there are 5 FBI probes into the Clinton Foundation and their pay-for-play activities. Hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat.\nHillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath. Hillary is the one who lied to the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear. Hillary is the one who destroyed 33,000 emails. Hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again. We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating.\nHillary is not the victim \u2013 the American people are the victims of this corrupt system in every way, and this is your one chance to change it.\nHillary is likely to be under investigation for a very long time. One of her longtime supporters, a top Democratic Pollster, Doug Schoen, is now totally withdrawing his support. He wrote an article entitled \"I'm a Democrat, I worked for Bill Clinton, but I can't vote for Hillary.\"\nSchoen writes: \"I am now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election.\"\nSchoen warns that if Hillary is elected, she would be under protracted criminal investigation \u2013 and probably a trial of a sitting President.\nThe investigation will last for years, a trial will probably start, nothing will get done, and our country will continue to suffer.\nShe is unfit and unqualified to be President, and her election would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis we cannot afford. We need to be going to work for the American people \u2013 we can't do that with Hillary in the White House trying to avoid prosecution.\nHillary Clinton's corruption is a threat to Democracy, and the only way to save our Democracy is get out and vote by the millions.\nThe Clinton crime spree ends on November 8th. And when we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American People.\nMy Contract with The American Voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government.\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say. When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going to drain the swamp.\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs.\nMichigan has lost more than 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, a deal strongly supported by Hillary Clinton.\nBefore NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Our country has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit with the world. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary's tenure as Secretary of State. Her trade deal with South Korea killed another 100,000 America jobs.\nSo when you look around Michigan, and you see the rusted-out factories, the empty buildings, and the long unemployment lines, remember: Hillary Clinton did much of this to you.\nHillary got rich selling your jobs \u2013 the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America are the people who've given countless millions to the Clintons. Hillary gets rich making America poor.\nJust look at the devastation. Delphi laid off 3,627 workers here in Michigan. Most of those jobs went to Mexico. We are going to fight for the workers at Delphi. They got a raw deal, and they deserve better.\nGM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly Plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed through by Hillary Clinton.\nLear Corporation laid off another 50 people in Rochester Hills and moved their jobs to South Korea.\nFTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills. Their jobs went to Mexico.\nChrysler laid off over 5,300 workers. Those jobs went to Mexico, China, India and other countries.\nFord laid off 2,155 workers. Those jobs went to other countries.\nNow, Ford is moving all if its small car production to Mexico.\nA Trump Administration will stop the flight of American jobs.\nIf Ford, or another company, announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone \u2013 I will call the executives \u2013 and I will tell them that if they want do that, we will charge a 35% tax when they try to ship their products back across the border.\nIt used to be the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nWe are going to turn it all around. We are going to rebuild Flint. We are going to rebuild Detroit. And we are going to rebuild Michigan.\nI'd like to share a special message today with the African-American community in Michigan which has been so terribly harmed by the policies of the Clintons.\nLook at the City of Detroit. It used to be the manufacturing hub of the world \u2013 now, nearly half of Detroit residents do not work, it has the second-highest violent crime rate in the country, and the children are trapped in failing government schools.\nYet, as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees.\nI've outlined a plan for urban renewal, it's called A New Deal For Black America. That deal includes a plan to use the money we will save by securing our border, and curbing refugee admissions, to invest in communities like Flint and Detroit.\nIt includes a pledge of school choice for African-American children.\nMy plan also includes a promise to cancel billions in climate change spending for the United Nations \u2013 a number Hillary wants to increase \u2013 and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure, including clean water in cities like Flint.\nMy plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime \u2013 every child in this nation has a right to grow up in safety and peace. And my plan includes a pledge to restore manufacturing in the United States.\nHillary and the Democratic Party have run the inner cities for years, and only produced more poverty. The time has come for real change \u2013 I'm asking you for the honor of your vote so that together we can turn decades of political failure into generations of lasting success.\nHillary, on the other hand, wants to destroy what's left of manufacturing in Michigan with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A Trump Administration will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nWe will renegotiate NAFTA and, if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal. We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We are going to massively cut taxes for the Middle Class.\nWe will unleash American energy \u2013 including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. The Obama-Clinton war on coal is going to cost this state 50,000 jobs.\nWe will also work to restore and protect the Great Lakes. We are going to become a rich country again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees. Hillary's immigration plans mean generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism spreading into your schools and communities here in Michigan.\nWhen we win, we will suspend the Syrian Refugee Program \u2013 and we will keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nA Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe've received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been \u2013 it's a national emergency. They also warn America that Hillary's plan is the \"the most radical proposal in U.S. history.\"\nWhen I become President, we will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens, and put American Workers First.\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military.\nWe also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.\nHillary led us to disaster in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Then, after Benghazi, she looked the families of the fallen in the eye and lied \u2013 she blamed it all on a video.\nHillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before. Imagine if some of that money had been spent building new schools, roads and bridges right here in Michigan.\nNow, Hillary \u2013 trapped in her Washington bubble that is blind to the lessons of the past \u2013 wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia, that could drag us into World War III.\nThe arrogant political class never learns. They keep repeating the same mistakes, they keep telling the same lies, they keep producing the same failed results.\nHow can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her email server? It's just one disaster after another, one scandal after another, one betrayal after another.\nTo all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days \u2013\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nHillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change, and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I am asking you to dream big, to push for bold change, and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this country.\nI'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day \u2013 when they really mean another decade.\nAmerica is tired of waiting. The moment is now.\nAll we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country.\nThere is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done \u2014 the future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.\nHillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing \u2013 she's just made things worse. She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future.\nOur movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.\nWe are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice \u2013 not money and power \u2013 should rule the day.\nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people \u2013 not the donors and special interests.\nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.\nWith your vote, we are just 8 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.\nTogether, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n","44":"\nI am so excited to be here and I want to thank you. And you know I am really sorry and I know there are a lot of people outdoors who can't get in\u2014so I want to give a big shout out to the overflow outside. I'm here with a lot of great people who are working so hard on this campaign. I want to thank Ken Evans. Thank you so much, Ken. I want to thank three members of Congress: Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz; Congressman Alcee Hastings; and your Congresswoman Lois Frankel. I also want to thank Sheriff Israel for being here. And Mayor Resnick just gave me a key to the city of Wilton Manors. And I want to thank my longtime friend and such a great leader, Chad Griffin, Human Rights Campaign president. I know that Chad told me there are a bunch of Human Rights Campaign organizers. And as I've said many times, HRC for HRC sounds good to me.\nWell, my friends, just nine days left until November the 8th. Nine days that really will determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetimes. And we cannot take anyone or anything for granted. It's great to be here at the Manor Complex, a place that means so much to so many. And there have been ups and downs in all that we've gone through over the years, and even in this campaign, but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you \u2013 your lives, your futures. The problems that keep you up at night. That's what I'm interested in, and that's what I'm going to be talking about here today and throughout the next nine days.\nThat's really what this election is about. There's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who, as our president, can help us get there. So I want you to know \u2013 now, I just have to say I know I'm preaching to the choir. But I also, through you, want to talk to people who are still making up their minds, believe it or not, right? Because we've got a choice between a president who will bring us together, keep our country safe, get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top \u2013 or someone who's temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job. You know, Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. I mean, he's such a downer, right? And it's time for him to stop fear mongering, stop distracting from what's really at stake, and frankly, stop disgracing our democracy. We can't let him get away with this.\nBut here's the good news. Yes, America is great, and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals. But we are seeing Americans coming together \u2013 Democrats, Republicans, independents \u2013 to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision of our country. And it's going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days what's at stake. Because I really believe the vast majority of Americans agree with us. We don't want a president who demeans women. We don't want a president who has plans to break up and deport immigrant families. We don't want a president who perpetrated the lie that President Obama wasn't born in America. We don't want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality. But I want you to know, the energy we're now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what we're against, it's also about what we're for. Because we also share a common vision. Beyond partisanship and politics, it's a hopeful, inclusive America where everyone counts and everyone has a place, right?\nAnd that's exactly what I'm going to be fighting for in these last nine days. We're going to honor people, not insult them. Donald Trump has insulted more than half of our population. African Americans, Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, POWs, women. And by what he has said, so many others who believe that you have a positive future. I agree with that: you do. And I promise you this: I'm going to keep working every single day for you and for the vision of America that we share.\nNow, I will tell you, my mom taught me to never, ever quit, and what does that mean? Well, that means \u2013\"\nAudience Member: \"Rise up.\"\nClinton: \"You got it. You got it. And it also means when you're knocked down, what matters is whether you get up again. I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life. I'm not stopping now. We're just getting warmed up, right? And we won't be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters, and we know how many people are counting on us. So we're going to take to heart the words of our wonderful First Lady, Michelle Obama: When they go low, we go high.\nWe're going to keep our foot on the gas because Donald Trump's strategy is real simple. They've even said it in his campaign. Here's his strategy about how he's going to win: Get women to stay home. Get young people to stay home. Get people of color to stay home. Get the LGBT committee to say home. It's all part of his scorched earth campaign, and it goes against everything we stand for. So you know how we're going to stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout in American history.\nWe need everybody to turn out and vote \u2013 women, young people, people of color, the LGBT community, Latinos, African Americans, Americans from all walks of life. Let's break every single record. Let's make that the story of this election. And here's some really good news. This is amazing. More than 20 million people have already voted in this election, most of those votes in the last few days, 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in. So if all of you vote, if your friends, your family, your coworkers vote, if everyone you talk to between now and Election Day votes, we are going to make some really big history on November the 8th.\nAnd I want you not only coming out for me. I want you to reelect our members of Congress. And please elect Patrick Murphy to the Senate. And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election, listen to this. We've heard some outrageous things in this campaign. I'm sure we'll hear more in the next nine days. But I got to tell you, I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.\nBut yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning. It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York. Now, let me say, this is important in part to remember. This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS. So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school, and all the kids and their families, for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine. Because you know, back in the '90s, some of you remember. Right? Children weren't welcomed in school.\nAnd then, unannounced and uninvited, guess who barges in? Donald Trump. He walks right up to the stage. He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation. None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there. He wasn't a donor at all. He had never given a single dollar to help build the school. He just wanted people to think he had. So he sat on the stage through the program, even posed for photographs, and when it was over, he got up and walked out. No explanation. No donation. Now really, who does that? What kind of person does that? Really? I mean, who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good? Well, I'll tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.\nBack in 1997, he was principal for a day at a public school. That was a program we used to have in New York. The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament. They were $5,000 short. He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill. At first the kids and their parents were excited. Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke. So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine. Now, this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trump's behavior, called the school, and donated the $5,000. And the coach remembers this woman saying, \"I am ashamed to be the same species as this man.\"\nNow, I got to say, any of you see the debates? Well, you know, I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job. Right? But a lot of what we've heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern. And here's what the Washington Post concludes. 'For as long as he has been rich and famous, he has wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public, even nationally televised promises, to give his own money away. It was in large part a fa\u00e7ade.' And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people's giving as his own.\nNow, of course, because he's refused to release his tax returns, we don't even know if he's ever given anything. But here's what we do know. With Donald, it's always Donald Trump first and everyone else last. He abuses his power. He games the system, and he doesn't care who's left holding the bag.\nAnd here's what else we know. Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights. And this election will determine whether we continue the progress we've made or let it be ripped away. We know Trump has promised he'll appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obama's executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination. And just this week, a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees. It's a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trump's golf courses. So I want you just to think.\nThis guy works hard. Works with his hands. Probably there 12 hours a day, maybe more, when it's the summer season. After he told his coworkers he was gay, they started harassing him. They called him names. They even threw rocks and golf balls at him. It got so bad he ended up in the hospital. Now, his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing. So finally he went to the police for help. He was too scared even to come back to work. And what did the Trump golf course do? They fired him.\nNow, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day. And it's deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior, Trump's business punished the victim for coming forward. Now, if that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does it say about how he would run our country? We've made a lot of progress on LGBT rights, but as that story reminds us, we still have work ahead, don't we?\nThere is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT, or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant, and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday, post your Facebook photos on Sunday, and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love. So here's what I'll do as president. We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act. And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives. We'll work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach. And we will take on homelessness, bullying, and violence, particularly youth homelessness, which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids. And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy. LGBT kids don't need to be cured of anything. They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected. And yes, we're going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.\nNow, some of you know, Chad Griffin and others know, this issue is really important to me. I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. I saw how countries around the world treated lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. And I believe with all my heart America has to lead by example. I want \u2013 I want LGBT people in every corner of our country \u2013 because don't forget you all living in Wilton Manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today. Right? And we're going to elevate this issue. We're going to talk about it. We're going to reach out.\nSo when you vote in this election, remember, it's not just my name on the ballot. It's your future. It's who we are as a country. It's every issue we care about. And make no mistake: LGBT rights are at stake. Dignity and respect for every American is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake.\nI believe when the middle class thrives, Americans thrive. And we're going to make America the clean-energy superpower of the 21st Century, too. And if we're serious about supporting a middle class, we're going to be supporting families.\nThe other day, I was in Pittsburgh. And there was a woman there with her young child. We've got some folks from Pittsburgh. She was shaking Tim Kaine's hand. And she said to him, \"I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton I had my baby three years ago. And the next day, I was fired. It had been a difficult pregnancy. I called to ask if I could take a little time to recover, and the answer was 'No. Don't come back at all.' Nobody, no parent, should ever have to make that kind of choice, but that's also true when we talk about paid family leave, caring for a spouse or a partner, caring for an elderly relative.\nI want us to recognize the way we live today. It is no longer the 1950s. We need to support people who are part of committed relationships, of families, of marriages, and give everybody the support you need to actually do what's the most important thing in life. And that is caring for each other. We're going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of the world: affordable childcare, paid family leave, earned sick days, jobs with rising incomes. We're going to raise the national minimum wage. No one who works full-time should have to raise a family in poverty.\nAnd yes, we're going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. We're going to make sure. We're going to make sure that we not only grow the economy but we make it fairer. And I've got to tell you that's such a stark contrast with Trump. He believes if you give the biggest tax cut in American history to the wealthy \u2013 that's with trillions of dollars going to the top \u2013 that will somehow trickle down. It hasn't worked. It won't work. I believe that we could grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And that's exactly what we're going to do.\nSo, my friends, we've got a guy who won't pay his income tax. I mean, I've got to just say when we learned in the debate that he lost a billion dollars and that meant that he didn't pay income tax for like 20 years, he said that was smart. And I thought to myself, how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars? I mean, really. And what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos? But it's serious because it means he's paid zero, zero for our military, our vets, for healthcare, for Pell Grants, for our universities, our colleges, our highways. This is Trump to a T.\nThe stories that I told you about him showing up and acting like he's done something, well, he shows up and criticizes our country. He shows up and discriminates against African Americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments. He chose to make his products in other countries, not America. He's built a career on stiffing small businesses. I take that personally. My dad was a small business owner. I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump.\nSo, my friends, we've got work to do. And let's get to that work. We've got to make sure that we get everybody out to vote. I want you to be able to say on November 9th you voted for a better future, you voted for a better America. And look how easy it is. It is so easy. Wilton Manors City Hall is just a half a mile down the street from where we are right now. And if you are registered in Broward County, you can go to any early-vote location in the county from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. all week. And if you have been mailed your ballot, make sure you fill it out and mail it back today. You can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. And make sure you have a plan to vote.\nBut, please, also help us in these last nine days. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So go to hillaryclinton.com. Sign up to volunteer. Take out your phone. Text 'JOIN,' J-O-I-N, to 47246. I don't want anybody waking up on Wednesday morning and seeing the results and getting depressed. I'm against depression. We don't want that to happen in this election. Right?\"\nAudience: \"No!\"\nClinton: \"I don't want people to be sad because they didn't do their part. We can't let that happen. And I have to ask you if you \u2013 if you know anybody, if you know anybody, who is thinking about voting for Trump, you've got to stage an intervention. Do everything you can to try to convince that person that they surely care about something that Donald Trump is on the wrong side of because I can guarantee you they do because, after all, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. Right?\nSo I am so grateful to all of you. Have many of you have already voted? Okay. So, now, how many of you will help us get somebody else to vote? That's what's going to make the difference. Change is coming. Let's make sure it's the right kind of change. The choice is yours. We're going to do everything we can to build a stronger, better, fairer America, coming together, healing the divides among us. And we're going to prove, once and for all, that love trumps Hate. Thank you.\n","45":"\nGo, Daytona Beach! Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. [Chants of \"Hillary.\"] Thank you, all. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. I am just thrilled to be here. Are you I'm ready to canvass? Well, we need your help in these last 10 days until the election.\nI want to thank Leslie Pearce for that introduction and her lifelong work on behalf of children. I want to thank State Representative Dwayne Taylor and Mayor Derrick Henry for being here with us. And to all of the elected officials, all of the organizers and the volunteers, I am thrilled to have this chance to come by and talk with you for a few minutes about what's at stake in this election because this may be one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. And we cannot take anything or anyone for granted.\nI was just over at BCU for their homecoming celebration. And a lot of people told me they had already voted, but I said, 'Get your friends. Get your family. Get everybody you know to vote' because you've got early voting here in this county, in Volusia County, until November 5th. No excuses. Everybody's got to get out and vote. And that's what this canvass is meant to make sure we do. Right?\nNow, I'm sure that some of you may have heard about a letter that the FBI director sent out yesterday. Well, if you're like me, you probably have a few questions about it. It is pretty strange. It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, in fact, it's not just strange. It's unprecedented. And it is deeply troubling because voters deserve get to full and complete facts. And so we've called on Director Comey to explain everything right away, put it all out on the table. Right?\nNow, of course, Donald Trump is already making up lies about this. He is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. I think it's time for Donald Trump to stop fear mongering, to stop disgracing himself, to stop attacking our democracy. We can't let him get away with this, can we?\nNow, like any campaign, there have been ups and downs and ups and downs, but I've got to tell you I feel so motivated, so excited, so ready because I've always stayed focused on one thing: you and your families. What I worry about are the problems that keep you up at night, and I'm going to stay focused on that, because you know on November 9th that's what's going to matter. We can't let this election in the last 10 days be about the noise and the distractions. It's got to be about what kind of country we want for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren \u2013 and who can help take us there as your president.\n[Chants of \"Hillary!\"]\nNow, I think you and I agree the choice is pretty clear between a president who's ready to bring us together, keep us safe, and make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, and someone who is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job.\nNow, I promise you this: I will never stop working for you every single day as a candidate and most importantly as your president. That's how I was raised. When I was over at B-CU I met one of the Methodist ministers because B-CU is affiliated with the Methodist Church, and I felt right at home. And my mother \u2013 my mother taught me to never, ever quit. Now what does that mean? Well, that means everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up. And I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now. We're just getting started.\nAnd let's always remember what our wonderful First Lady told us: 'When they go low, we go high.' So no matter what they throw at us in these last days, we're not going to back down. We're not going to get distracted. We're not going to get knocked off course. Because we know how much the election matters. We know how many people are counting on us. And that's why we're going to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision about America.\nWe are going to stick together and we are going to win on November the 8th. Right? Because Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They've even said it in his campaign. It's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot \u2013 get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home too. Now, this is all part of his scorched earth campaign. It goes against everything we stand for. And you know how we stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout of voters in American history.\nWe need more of everybody to vote \u2013 more women, more young people, more people of color, more African Americans, more Latinos, everybody. Let's break every record that we've ever had for voting. Let's make that the story of this election. And here in Florida you can, as you often have, make the difference. Right, Florida? If you all vote and you get everybody you know to vote, if you go out and talk to people today and every day about what's at stake in this election, then we will make history. We will win up and down the ballot. And I feel strongly about this, because we need people in Washington who are problem-solvers, not problem-makers. That's why I hope you'll vote to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate. He will be an independent voice for Florida families. And this is important: Unlike his opponent, Patrick has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nNow, here's some really good news. We just reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That is the highest number ever. And that includes 50 million young people. That's the most in history. And you know what else? More than 16.5 million people have already voted in this election. And more than 3 million of those votes have been right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like we're seeing here in Florida when people are standing up for what they really believe in. Americans are coming together, and I know because I hear from people who are Republicans and Independents who are joining us to reject hate and division, rejecting Donald Trump's demeaning treatment of women, his plans to break up immigrant families and deport millions of people, his lie that President Obama wasn't born in America.\nI'll tell you, we have learned who Donald Trump is. Now it's up to us to show who we are. And the energy that we are seeing is not just about what we're against, it's about what we're for. It's about a common vision that we share for a hopeful, dynamic, unified America where everyone counts, everyone has a place, everyone willing to work can get ahead and stay ahead, where women are respected \u2013 where veterans are honored, where workers are paid fairly, where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong.\nSo my friends, it is not just the fact that my name will be on the ballot. Everything we care about is at stake \u2013 your future \u2013 making college affordable, helping you pay back your debt \u2013 the cost of prescription drugs down \u2013 protecting and defending Social Security and Medicare from privatization and Wall Street schemes. Fighting climate change is at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. In the end, we know that American dream itself is at stake.\nNow, did any of you see the debates?\"\nAudience: \"Yes.\"\nClinton: \"Well, I'll tell you, I stood next to Donald Trump for three debates, four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief. But I have to tell you, he said a lot of things that were troubling. But in that last debate, he said something that was truly horrifying. He is the first person of a major party, Republican or Democrat, ever to refuse to say he would respect the outcome of the election. Now, we can think about every issue we care about, but you know, after attacking women and African Americans and Latinos and people with disabilities and Muslims and POWs and everybody, now he's attacking the institutions of democracy. And so it comes down to this. When your kids and grandkids ask, 'What did you do in the 2016 election when everything was on the line,' I want you to be able to say you voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.\nAnd the way we're going to do that: We're going to turn everybody out. Early voting has begun right here in Volusia County. Every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. until November 5th you can vote. The nearest early voting site is just one mile away from here at the Volusia County Library Center in City Island. So don't wait one more day. Go vote, and then help us get everybody else out to vote too.\nNow, I know \u2013 I know that we've got our canvass organizers up here. I don't want to take too much of their time because they are workers, they are organized, they are focused. I'm so grateful to them and to you, and we need you. We need you. Stakes couldn't be higher. We got to do everything we can. I don't want anybody waking up on November 9th and saying, 'Oh, I wish I had just done a little more.' So help us knock on doors, make phone calls, talk to voters, and ask them, 'When are you going to vote? Do you know where you're going to cast your ballot? Who will you take with you?' And make sure they know about early voting, already begun here in Florida. And then if you need to, sign up yourselves. We have signups for three more shifts between now and Election Day. And this is going to be a close election; they always are these days. And we're going to win because of you, because of hardworking volunteers like you. And if you know anybody thinking about voting for Donald Trump, stage an intervention. Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.\nAnd think about it this way. On January 20th, we're going to have a new president. And I'll tell you what, I will be proud to build on the progress we've made under President Obama and go even further. But I can't do any of the things that I'm talking about, any of the plans that I have, unless you help me. So that's what I'm asking you. That's why I came to Daytona Beach today. I came to ask you to help me in these last ten days. Let's give every American a chance to chart their own future, make their own contributions. Let's build a future we can all be proud of, and let's make sure we prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you.\n","46":"\nReal change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.\nAs you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.\nThis is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.\nHillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles.\nHer criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful.\nHillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure.\nShe set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk.\nTo further cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear \u2013 some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.\nShe even pretended not to know that the letter \"C\" meant confidential information that was classified.\nAs the recent release of a memo from one of Bill Clinton's closest associates demonstrates, the Clintons have turned the government into a scheme for personal profit.\nThe Clintons even saw the deadly disaster in Haiti as an opportunity to cash-in.\nThe WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we've ever seen before \u2013 including a candidate who boasts to donors about having a public position for the voters, and a private position for Wall Street.\nHillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\nHillary should have been convicted long ago.\nThat the legal process has been taking this long is incredible.\nAnd now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI \u2013 that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect her.\n97% of Department of Justice employees' presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.\nThere are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General.\nPerhaps that was what Bill Clinton was doing in the secret meeting on the tarmac in Arizona.\nHe said it was to play golf, but he never played, and it was over 100 degrees.\nThis is what we mean when we call it a rigged system.\nNow the Attorney General is fighting the FBI for doing what was right \u2013 but what should have been done many months ago.\nPerhaps, through this other investigation, they found what may be some of the 33,000 missing and deleted emails Hillary tried desperately to destroy, even going so far as to use digital bleach.\nThe stakes on November 8th could not be higher.\nA vote for Hillary is vote a to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the very foundations of our Constitutional system.\nWhat makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws \u2013 Hillary's corruption shreds that foundational principle.\nPublic Corruption is a grave and profound threat to a Democracy.\nGovernment corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, and infects the operations of government itself.\nIf the corruption is not removed, then the people are not able to have faith in their government.\nIt deadens and saps the spirit of civic participation.\nCorruption decays our trust in institutions and our legal system.\nWhen the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope.

And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.\n","47":"\nThe silent majority is back. In 10 days, we are going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win back the White House.\nA Trump Administration will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nIt's just been announced that the citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums. Elect me, and WE WILL STOP THE PREMIUM HIKES FOR GOOD. WE WILL STOP THE MADNESS OF OBAMACARE.\nEvery single one of Arizona's 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of Obamacare. In Phoenix, there are 8 Obamacare insurers this year. Next year there will be only one. And it was announced this week that Obamacare premiums in Phoenix will go up 145% next year. One insurer in the state will have a $14,000 deductible.\nObamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona, and a catastrophe for all of America.\nEven Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is \"the craziest thing in the world,\" where \"people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\"\nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said \"the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.\"\nJonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, admitted it was all a fraud, and he said, outrageously, that it was passed because of the \"stupidity of the American voter.\"\nHillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive.\nMy Contract With the American Voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and I'm asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in Arizona.\nReal change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.\nAs you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.\nThis is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.\nHillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful.\nHillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure \u2013 and exposure.\nShe set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk. But she didn't care \u2013 as long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family didn't matter.\nTo cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear \u2013 some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI many times, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.\nThe WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government.\nHillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. She'd put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators \u2013 whoever offers the highest price.\nYet, now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI \u2013 that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton.\n97% of Department of Justice employee's presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.\nThere are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she were to become President. Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Attorney General Lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in Arizona.\nThis is what we mean when we say the system is rigged.\nA vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself.\nWhat makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws \u2013 Hillary's corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was founded.\nGovernment corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, infecting the whole operation of our government.\nWhen the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope \u2013 they stop dreaming, they stop trying.\nWhen the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then people lose confidence in our laws and in our future.\nHillary's corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation, and it must be stopped.\nAs FDR once said, \"government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.\"\nHillary believes money and power \u2013 not truth and justice \u2013 should rule the day.\nWe have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption, and that is the power of voting. The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions, including millions of people voting for the first time in their entire lives.\nVote with all of your heart and soul to Make America Great Again.\nRestoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.\nHaven't we had enough drama with the Clintons? Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice, signed the worst trade deal in history, NAFTA, which emptied our country of it's manufacturing jobs, and he doesn't even have the right to practice law.\nHillary has brought scandal or destroyed everything she touched.\nLook at Whitewater, cattle futures, jobs in Upstate New York, or look at Syria, Iraq, Libya, and now her emails.\nThis will be the year the American people say: enough is enough.\nThis will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future.\nMy Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption.\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say.\nWhen we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs.\nRight now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty, or near the brink of poverty.\nAmerica has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Hillary's goal is to send millions and millions more jobs out of our country.\nHillary is going to raise taxes up to 45 percent, massively expand regulation, shut down American energy, and push through terrible trade deals that offshore our jobs for the benefit of her donors.\nHer policies will cause a major recession, or even a depression.\nA Trump Administration will stop TPP, renegotiate NAFTA, and we are going to stand up to China on Currency Manipulation.\nWe are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe are going to cut taxes for Middle Class families by hundreds of billions of dollars.\nMy infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate-11, which would connect Phoenix with Las Vegas and other areas.\nWe will also unleash the full power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\nWe will become a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nA Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the endorsement of America's ICE and Border Patrol Officers, the first time they have ever made an endorsement.\nWhen Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State she allowed thousands of the most dangerous criminal aliens in the world to go free inside America because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\nThese were people guilty of murder, assault, rape, and all manner of violent crime.\nHillary has pledged \"open borders,\" and supports Sanctuary Cities.\nCountless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government won't do it's job.\nThese include amazing Americans like Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, of Mesa Arizona, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record who should have been deported \u2013 but the government refused to act. I've spent time with his incredible mother.\n28-year-old Park Ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed by a drug cartel hit squad responsible for a number of murders. Kris died trying to protect our borders from drug and weapon trafficking into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.\n33-year-old Phoenix Police Officer Nick Erfle, a young cancer survivor, was murdered by a previously- deported illegal immigrant with a felony warrant. Nick was shot twice in the back of the head.\n21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, was working at a convenience store in Mesa Arizona when he was shot point blank by an illegal immigrant.\nHis illegal immigrant killer, despite a criminal record, was out on bond, roaming free.\nWhen I become President, this crime wave ends.\nWe are going to cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities.\nWe are going to impose tough prison sentences for illegal immigrants who return after a previous deportation.\nWe will end illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and save American lives.\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have the endorsements of over 200 Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor Recipients.\nOur Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been, and my plan builds the modern, advanced fighter aircraft we need \u2013 fighters like those that will be stationed at Luke Air Force Base.\nOur Army is the smallest it has been since before World War II, and we will significantly increase both the size of our Army and the emphasis we place on intelligence \u2013 that means supporting the men and women at Fort Huachuca, home of the Army's Intelligence Center.\nPlaces like Marine Corps Air Station Yuma will have new aircraft \u2013 they won't have to get spare parts from museums anymore.\nWe also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.\nHillary's policies unleashed ISIS, empowered Iran, and spread death and destruction across the Middle East.\nHillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before.\nOur failed establishment has betrayed the American worker and family. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, they have left our borders wide open at home, and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.\nTo all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days \u2013\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nAmericans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade.\nHillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing \u2013 she's just made things worse.\nShe is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future.\nOur movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.\nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people \u2013 not the donors and special interests.\nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who yearns for a better future.\nWith your vote, we are just 10 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.\nTogether, We Will Make America JUST Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n","48":"\nThank you. [applause]\nThank you very much. [applause]\nWe love New Hampshire, I can tell you that. [applause]\nI need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement. [applause]\nThe FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new e-mails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation\nAudience: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\nAnd they are reopening her case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America. [applause]\nHillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. [applause]\nThis was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood. And it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected. [applause]\nSo that is a big announcement that I heard 10 minutes ago and I guess obviously most of you folks have heard about, and in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently four-star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done. [applause]\nWith that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech? We will talk about borders, right? We will talk about trade. We'll bring back our jobs, we'll strengthen our military and let's get going, OK? [applause]\nI want to thank General Flynn, he's a great general and I want to thank you for being here, General. Thank you very much. Just before General Flynn was going up we heard this news. I said, \"General get up there and keep them busy. We want to digest what just happened here.\" Thank you General.\nIn 11 days we are going to win New Hampshire [applause] the state of my first victory. And we are going to win back the White House. [applause]\nSeventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track and we are going to fix it. We are going to get our country back on the right track, and very, very quickly. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare [applause]\nWe can't forget how big a news that is, we can't lose track. It's a disaster, just like everything else in this administration.\nIt has just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare premiums, including a 116 percent premium hike to our very good friends in the great state of Arizona.\nEven Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world, where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be almost 60 percent, the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare [booing] admitted it was all a fraud and he said it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. Hey, we're doing a lot of good work, aren't we? We're catching all of these people. We're doing a good job. Jonathan Gruber, there's another. See, we didn't forget. I never forgot Jonathan Gruber.\nI said you know, if I do this, we're going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two. I said I am never going to forget Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare and what he said. So we did not forget. Almost can you imagine, it's like a little more than a week before the election. We didn't forget the name Jonathan Gruber.\nBut the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the American voter. Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. What I've just announced previously it might not be as rigged as I thought. Right? Right? [applause]\nThe FBI I think they're going to right the ship, folks. I think they're going to right the ship. [applause]\nAnd they're going to save their reputation by doing so.\nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, destroying American health care forever. She wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. I will repeal and replace Obamacare and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much, much better. [applause]\nJust this year, Hillary Clinton declared Obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, the Democratic Party and our country. Well, that was that's turned out to be wrong. Do they do anything right? We don't win anymore. We don't I mean, you're going to have such a good time starting in '17. We're going to start winning again. We're going to start winning again. [applause]\nBecause it's turned out, and I've been saying this from before it passed, Obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination. Insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing, workers' hours are being cut, part-time jobs are all over the place. Those beautiful full-time jobs that you used to have don't exist and deductibles are through the roof. You don't get to use it. We don't get rid of Obamacare, we have no choice. But if we don't get rid of it, our health care system is gone forever. We'll never have another chance.\nAnd by the way, if we don't win this election, you're never going to have another chance either, that I can tell you. Never going to happen again. Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November 8th. [applause]\nBut real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, and again, maybe that's happened. Wow. We have a big day. [applause]\nNo think of it, I won my first primary in New Hampshire and I am getting here and the news this morning is this is bigger than Watergate. This is bigger than Watergate in my opinion. This is bigger than Watergate [applause]\nHillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. That alone to me there were more serious things done, but how does it get much more? But that was so obvious. She gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes 33,000 e-mails. That to me because it was so simple, you know? Not it's not about the sale of the uranium that nobody knows what it means I know what it means to Russia. Then she talks to me about Russia. 20 percent of the uranium in our country to Russia.\nBut you know, the deletion of 33,000 e-mails, boy, that just sort of is so out there, after receiving a subpoena from the United States government. She lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. The Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI [booing] and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, but maybe that takes care of itself. Right now that takes care of itself I think, I think. Very proud that the FBI was willing to do this actually, really, very proud. [applause]\nJust yesterday we learned that Bill Clinton's right-hand man pushed for Clinton's foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as $66 million in personal profit to Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nThis man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm to foundation and Clinton's personal income had helped Bill and Hillary enrich themselves, and obtain in-kind services, including personal travel, hospitality, vacations, and the like. [booing]\nThe same people paying Bill Clinton for speeches were lobbying Hillary Clinton at the same the same time, same time. [booing]\nAnd these people are seriously corrupt. [booing]\nTerribly conflict. Hillary's pay for play included defense contracts. Take Raytheon, when the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals, they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Hillary's last campaign, and are raising money for her current campaign.\nAnd by the way 50 to 1 in ads, 50 to 1. And if you look at Florida, we're winning. Ohio, we're winning. Iowa we're winning. [applause]\nDoing great in New Hampshire. I think we're going to have a tremendous victory in Pennsylvania. [applause]\nWe better have a great victory in New Hampshire, please. OK, we will. [applause]\nIn fact when this news when this news of the FBI's investigation, when it just happened a little while ago, they said Mr. Trump, I think they'd understand, we could skip your speech in New Hampshire this is so big. I said I don't have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire. Believe me, I don't have the courage. [applause]\nI'm not skipping New Hampshire, I never will. You know, when I won, and you remember because I go around and we had the big rallies, and they said oh, the big rallies will never work in New Hampshire, you have to sit down and have dinner with everybody. I said that's like that's a lot of dinners. They don't expect that.\nBut you remember when we met, and I'd have a lot of small meetings too with people, we'd talk, and New Hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country. And your police department, so great, the police departments in New Hampshire, they told me. I went to some, I became friendly with some. [applause]\nAnd I never knew I never knew, honestly, I knew it was bad, I never knew it was so bad. And I said to the people of New Hampshire, because more than any other place, you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams, and everything is so beautiful, the trees, and you say how could they have a drug problem here? It doesn't fit.\nBut I'd sit down with groups, and I said what's your biggest problem? And I figured they'd say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area, we understand that. But it was always -- and we'll solve that problem. But it was always, you know what, it was always heroine. I'd say heroine? What do you mean? And I learned so much. And I said to the people of New Hampshire that if I win, which I did with New Hampshire, if I win, and I also said and if I go all the way, we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100 percent [applause]\nAnd I gave the people of New Hampshire my pledge, more than anybody else in this case, because they really taught me about what's happening with the world of drugs pouring in. Hard to believe. It's just so, so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem, by far.\nAnyway, with months these lobbyists sealed over $26 billion in foreign arms deals, including over $19 billion in Qatar, some people would say Qatar, which happened to be off Bill Clinton. $1 million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time. $1 million. The lobbyists, one of whom was the sister-in-law to Hillary Clinton's current campaign chairman, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees, the contractor got billions of dollars in contracts, and Hillary Clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundation.\nAnd you know I'm putting up tremendous amounts of money. Today I wrote another check for $10 million. I'm spending money like crazy. I'll probably have over maybe close to or over $100 million of my money spent on the campaign. But there's something nice about that. Unless I lose, in which case I say, \"What was that all about?\" But we're gonna do what's right for you, not what's right for some contributor or special interest. [applause]\nHillary put the office of the secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance, believe me she would put the office and you know what office I'm talking about the office called the Oval Office up for sale too. I propose a contract with the American voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words I'm about to say, and I never loved this expression but now I love it because it's become it's become the hottest expression. If we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. when we win, OK and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. You've been suffering with the jobs. The jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby. New growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous 1.5 percent. If China goes down to 7 or 8 percent GDP, you know it's like a national catastrophe. Last quarter we were at 1 percent. Our job numbers last week were horrible. They were anemic, as the expression goes. They like to say anemic, that was the word they used. Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth.\nAnd they say it's hard because we're a large county. Well India is a much larger country and they're at 8 percent. China is at 7 percent. And China's not happy. So we're at around 1 percent and we just keep going along, just keep going along losing our jobs to Mexico and every other place. Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million people think of it, this is our country are living in poverty.\nMeanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. You say, \"Who negotiates these contracts?\" We're living through Obama. It's true. You know instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton he ought to be in the White House in the Oval Office negotiating trade deals, beating ISIS, taking care of our veterans which he does not do. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. They're stealing our jobs. Greatest in the history of the world.\nNew Hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary disaster.\nThe Trump administration will immediately begin negotiating and we will start this negotiation so fast. We will start a negotiation on NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much, much better trade deal. [applause]\nAnd I won't go into the details, but because they're different tax systems, they're under a VAT system and we're under our system, but because of the fact that they're under a much different tax system, the day the deal was signed it was a defective deal, with us having a massive, at least 17 percent disadvantage.\nSo it's complicated. I'm not going to bother you or bore you with it, but we've been working with a defective deal for years, and nobody, no politician ever went back to renegotiate it. We're going to get it done, folks, so easily. [applause]\nIf a company wants to fire their workers and go to Mexico or another country and then they think they're going to ship their products back into the United States, we will charge them a tax of 35 percent. [applause]\nSo when you think these companies, which right now are out there negotiating to leave here, they'll leave New Hampshire, they'll leave Pennsylvania, they're gonna leave Ohio, they're gonna leave all of these places, all of our great places and great states. And right now as we're talking, they're negotiating deals.\nMexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants. A friend of mine, Bill Plante, he's the biggest, he said the eighth wonder of the world what's happening in Mexico. And I say, and I tell this to people, what about us? He said meh, not gonna be it's gonna be the other way around. [applause]\nBut there will be consequences. And you know, when they realize that they've got to now pay a tax, all of that, to come through our very strong border, because there will be a strong border [applause] with their product, you know what they're gonna say? They're gonna say let's say, we're not gonna move, and they're gonna stay. It's very simple. But the politicians don't want to do that because they're controlled they're controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things. We will does anybody know what I mean by that? [applause]\nWe will also stand up to Chinese currency manipulation and we will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. [applause]\nWe will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world and it has now spread into our country. There are right now 1,000 open ISIS investigations across the United States, more than at any time that we've ever had. Now, Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent [booing] the massive number of Syrian refugees flowing into our country. That's over the Obama numbers, and those are thousands and thousands of people. A Trump administration will suspend the Syrian refugee program. [applause]\nAnd we'll help them will safe havens and we'll get other countries over there, like the Gulf states who have nothing but money, we have $20 trillion in debt. We'll get them to pay, they gotta do their share. We'll lead it, we'll help, they'll pay, but you know what? We can't let people into this country that we don't know about we don't know. [applause]\nLet me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president, I am going to keep [applause]\nWhen... [applause]\nWe love New Hampshire, I love this place. I love this place. By the way, you know, we're leading in Florida, we're leading in all these places. The recent poll said we're two down in New Hampshire. You know what I said? I don't think so, I don't think so. [applause]\nThese polls, these polls, these are called dirty polls, you know what that is? These are false. I don't think so. She comes up here, she has four people, and it's like oh, we have a wonderful crowd. I don't think so. I think we're winning New Hampshire big.\nOK. So we'll change it. When I'm elected president [applause]\nI am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]\nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. Boy, you people have energy, you're great. [applause]\nWell, let's face it, it's been a long time, right? It's been a long time. You've been waiting a long time for the right person, but you do have energy.\nYou know what's happening? A lot of these places\nA lot of the different places, reports are coming out. They hate to write it, you know the dishonest media. [booing]\nBut people by the way, great people, oh they're the worst, they're so dishonest. They are so dishonest, folks. But a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states, people are coming up that have never voted. These are great Americans, these are great people, but they've just never seen anybody that they wanted to like they've never heard people say we're going to actually bring back your jobs. We're not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no tax.\nNo, no, just go ahead, leave, fire all our people, move to Mexico, make the product, sell your air conditioners Carrier's an example, they're leaving they might not leave, they're probably all about ready to change their mind. But just let your product come right in, no tax, no nothing. I mean, how stupid is this? How stupid?\nAnd I'm a free-trader, I'm a fair trader. But we have the wrong people represent us. So what's happening is these lines in Florida are four blocks long. They were never like that. They've never seen anything like it. And in Tennessee, a great congressman, been there for 25 years, said to me, \"I've never seen we have never seen anything like it.\" [applause]\nPeople are coming out that haven't voted in years. People are coming out, they literally they hadn't voted in years. So they're not polled because, you know, unless you voted like in the last election, they don't want to poll you. So, people are coming out that hadn't voted in years. Happening in Texas. They haven't voted in years.\nAnd people that have never even voted, and yet they're great Americans. They just never saw somebody that they wanted to vote for. And they're coming out and they've got the Trump shirt and they've got the hat, they've got buttons all over the place, you know. [applause]\nNow, who knows who knows? They may have all of the Trump stuff and you never know. Maybe they're voting for crooked Hillary Clinton, but I don't think so, right? I don't think so. [booing]\nHistory has taught us that we don't think so. So, I think we're doing great.\nAnd yes, on the border, we have no choice, we will build a wall and Mexico will pay for the wall. Got to stop the drugs. [applause]\nGot to stop the drugs. Remember my pledge to everybody but in particular to New Hampshire, because I know what you're going through with the drugs. I know what your incredible law enforcement, your police and your fire departments, because I see where they're helping so much. Believe me, they're they're not spoken about.\nAnd how about where they're shooting? During fires, they're shooting at the firemen. Now, this is a new phenomenon. They're shooting at firemen. They're shooting bullets at firemen going to fires and fighting fires. So we have a divided country and we're going to make our country love again. We're going to bring it like this room. [applause]\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. You've heard that story, you've seen it, you've read about it.\nThe man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the United States community under the policies of this White House. He was released again and again, after crime after crime and now is at large. Sarah graduated from college just the day before with a 4.0 grade point average, top in her class. She was violently, violently killed. Outstanding young woman. I know her parents; they're incredible.\nAlso among the victims of Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. And so many people said please, please, please don't release him, he's violent. And he shot Grant through the head.\nAnother victim who we've all read about and known about, Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant. [booing]\nAnd this person was deported five previous times. And now, he's got a good lawyer and the case will go on and on and on. He's got a lawyer, I see them in court all the time. The case will go on and on. Shot in the back while standing with her father. Great parents, great brother.\nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal. People begged that they be incarcerated or be moved out of the country, but our geniuses wouldn't listen.\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported. People asked please, please deport him. This is what happened. This is a crime wave that never ends. I can tell you it's thousands of cases like this.\nWhen I'm president, believe me, it will end. [applause]\nNot only will a wall keep out the dangerous cartels and criminals, but will also keep out the drugs, remember New Hampshire, and the heroin poisoning our youth. Our youth is being poisoned before they get a chance [applause]\nAnd by the way, I've met plenty of people in New Hampshire that are not our youth that have a tremendous problem, and I want to tell you, we're going to work with people, we're going to set up programs, we're going to try everything we can to get them unaddicted, unaddicted. [applause]\nSo as I said, when I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that we would stop drugs from pouring into your community and I guarantee you we will. You will be so proud of your president, you will be so proud of your community. [applause]\nYou will be so proud.\nI just want to say in closing I just want to say in closing that we have an amazing movement going on. A movement like they've never seen before, a movement that hopefully won't be stopped. We have a movement that the biggest people in the world of the media, the biggest, have said they've never seen anything like it before. Every every crowd, every auditorium.\nThe other night, we had a situation. We had thousands and thousands of people and I said to the fire marshal, isn't it possible to let more in? We had thousands of people in this massive field and we had many thousands outside of the gates they wouldn't let in and I said, couldn't we let them in? And they said, we can't. I said, but there's no fire, we're outside. He said, it's stampede, Mr. Trump, we're worried about a stampede.\nAnd it's a stampede of love. It's true. It's not a stampede it's a stampede of love. [applause]\nBecause there was so many people. They said we have very strong security guards, but Mr. Trump, they're not nearly strong as 45,000 people come charging forward. So I fully understood it. But we have something going on that's so special. It's so special. We're going to reduce your taxes, we're going to simplify your taxes. We're going to make your businesses welcome in our country. [applause]\nWe're going to reduce the taxes for middle-income people. We call them the forgotten men and women. Greatly simplify your returns. The only company that I can think of that won't like us is H&R Block, they will not like us.\nThey're not gonna like Trump too much.\nBut we'll greatly simplify your taxes. And your businesses we're taking it from 35 percent, which is one of the highest in the world, just about the highest, down to one of the lowest in the world, 15 percent. [applause]\nWe're getting rid of a lot of the regulations that are stopping growth. Tremendous amounts of regulation are killing your small businesses and your big businesses. So we're gonna have a very tax- friendly country again, and it's gonna mean jobs, it's gonna mean expansion, it's gonna mean new companies growing.\nWe are going to create the border. We are going to stop the drugs. We're gonna have people come into our country. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through a legal process. We want a lot of people to come in. [applause]\nAnd they're going to come in, but they'll come in legally. And we're gonna streamline the process. People are waiting on line now 10 years. We're gonna streamline because we want people to come in, but we want them to come in legally. And we want merit, too. We want to take wonderful, great people that love our country, they want to get out and they want to do a great job. We want to have them also come in based on merit. A word you don't hear anymore. A word you don't hear any more. It's too bad.\nWe're also going to very importantly appoint justices to the Supreme Court [applause]\nWho you can be proud of and who will respect the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nWe're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under unbelievable siege. [applause]\nWe're going to help big league on education, we're going to go with choice, so important, and we're going to terminate Common Core and bring education local. [applause]\nOur military is depleted. We're going to rebuild our military. We are going to lead through strength. [applause]\nAnd hopefully, we're not gonna have to use our military but I will say this. We're getting rid of ISIS. We're getting rid of ISIS. [applause]\nISIS is we have no choice. By the way, not since medieval times has anyone seen chopping off of heads, drowning in steel cages, burying in sand. Not since not since medieval times. It all grew during the tenure of Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nISIS you know she stands up and she says what she's gonna do. Well, she was there. It came out of the vacuum because we should have never gone into Iraq, but once we did, we should have gone out the right way, not the wrong way. And the way they went out was so bad, so bad, including giving back Mosul, which now they're fighting to take back. And it would have been nice the element of surprise. Do we agree? Does anybody not agree? [applause]\nThe element of surprise. We don't use the element of surprise. We use the element of tell them everything we can possibly tell them, give them plenty of time to get ready and then attack. And it turns out to be a lot tougher than they ever thought.\nBut we're going to have a country that you're going to be proud of again. We're going to have a president that hopefully you will be proud of. [applause]\nI will work so hard for every community. I'll be working very hard for the African-American community, for the Hispanic community. I'll be working hard for every community. And we're gonna have this divided nation come together. And I just want to say we're gonna make America strong again, we're gonna make America doesn't sound nice, but we have no choice wealthy again. [applause]\nBut we are going to make America great again. [applause]\nAnd I want to thank everybody in New Hampshire. Get out and vote. You're very special people. You're very, very special people. God bless you, get out and vote. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you, New Hampshire. [applause]\n","49":"\nHello, Winston-Salem! Hello Wake Forest! It is so great to be here in this beautiful city at this extraordinary time and to have a chance to be with so many, including the Wake Forest family. And it doesn't get any better than being here with our most amazing First Lady Michelle Obama. I want to thank everyone who has filled this arena, and I especially want to thank Dr. Hatch and the staff team and students at Wake Forest University. I will never forget being here with the legendary Maya Angelou, one of the most powerful voices our country has ever heard.\nSo I couldn't think of a better place to come back to with another woman whose voice we need now more than ever. I want to say what I think is obvious but can't be said enough, and that is this may be one of the most, if not the most important election of our lifetimes, no matter our age. But for young people it will be so consequential because every election is about the future. And this one is about whether we build on the progress we've made, the legacy that President Obama has built or rip it away and go backwards. So we have a lot of work to do.\nAnd I don't mean just in the presidential race. Let's be sure to elect Roy Cooper, the next governor of North Carolina. He will always put the people of North Carolina first. And he will repeal HB2 \u2013 because he knows that discrimination is wrong. It's bad for business, and it's against North Carolina's values.\nAnd let's send Deborah Ross to the United States Senate. She will be an independent voice for the working families in this state, and she will help break through the gridlock in Washington.\nAnd unlike her opponent, Deborah Ross has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And remember, it is not just Roy's name and Deborah's name or my name that's going to be on the ballot. So much of what we care about -- so much that's at stake in the election is, too.\nVoting rights are at stake. And if you care about this sacred right, and want to make sure our leaders of both parties do their part to protect and strengthen it -- not chip away at it, you've got to vote in this election. And so I hope, after all North Carolina has gone through with the efforts to suppress people's votes, you will turn out and say, \"No. We demand the right to vote.\"\nAnd supporting our veterans is at stake. If you believe that America should stand with those who served because they served us, then you've got to vote. And so when you think about yourselves, your families, people you know who've worn the uniform of our country, the best way to make clear that we respect the military, and we will do everything we can to make sure they and their families have what they need as they sacrificed for us, is to show up and vote.\nAnd climate change is at stake. Now, I shouldn't have to say this in 2016, but I will. If you believe in science, right? And you know that climate change is real and demands action right now \u2013 you've got to show up and vote in this election.\nImmigration is at stake. If you believe that we need to fix our broken system, keep families together, and give people who love America a path to citizenship \u2013 you've got to vote.\nAnd marriage equality is at stake, too. If you believe everyone deserves to be treated equally in America, no matter who they are or who they love \u2013 then you've got to turn out and vote in this election.\nGood jobs that pay good wages are at stake. Investing in our roads and our bridges and our water systems and all the work that needs to be done in our country. That really matters, and we can put millions of people to work and have a more competitive economy. That's why we've proposed a very big jobs program, because I don't want anybody willing to work in this country not to have a good job with a rising income to support themselves and their families. If you believe that, then you've got to come out and vote.\nAnd particularly, for all of the students here, affordable college education is at stake. And not only that, relief from student debt that you already have is at stake. So if you believe as we do that everyone should be able to afford to go to college and graduate and that everyone should be able to pay down and pay off their debt, then you've got to get out and vote in this election.\nAnd dignity for women and girls. Again, I wish I didn't have to say this, right? But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election. And I want to thank our First Lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value. So I think you're getting the idea here that I think everything we care about is at stake in this election. So you've got to vote \u2013 and get your friends and families and neighbors to vote too.\nAnd don't just take it from me because I think you've heard some really compelling voices say the same thing, and one of them is here with us today, right? There are so many things I admire about our First Lady. Michelle reminds us to work hard, stay true to our values, be good to one another and never, ever stop fighting for what we believe in.\nShe has spent eight years as our First Lady advocating for girls around the world to go to school and have the same opportunities as boys. She has worked for healthier childhoods for our kids here at home, better nutrition, more exercise. And we are seeing the results. We actually are seeing kids who are healthier, something that she was determined to try to achieve. She has encouraged more young people to go to college and follow your dreams, and she has supported America's military families, who serve and sacrifice as well for our country.\nNow, it hasn't been all hard work. She played a mean round of 'Carpool Karaoke,' and among the many real privileges I've had is to see the President and the First Lady dance. Wow, one could only hope. Now, she also planted an amazing vegetable garden at the White House \u2013 and I can promise you, if I win, I will take good care of it, Michelle.\nAnd boy \u2013 thank you! Boy, didn't she dazzle the world with that wise and beautiful speech at the Democratic National Convention this summer?\nAnd I have now, I have now stood on the debate stage for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, and if you see any of those debates, well, that has proved once and for all that I have the stamina to be President and Commander in Chief. But there were times during those three debates, the loop running in my head was what Michelle said at the convention, right? 'When they go low, we go high.'\nAnd on top of all that, just by being herself every day, never missing an opportunity to honor her parents for the hard work and sacrifice that set her on her way, she has shown every little girl and boy in America that there are no limits to what they can achieve if they work hard and do right and believe in themselves.\nSeriously \u2013 is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?\nAnd maybe, maybe it's especially meaningful to me because I do know something about being First Lady of the United States, and I'm going to state the obvious. It's not easy. You've got so many people counting on you. You've got the eyes of the world on you. And when you're trying to raise your children as she is and I did, and give them the space and support they need to have as normal and safe and fulfilling childhoods as possible \u2013 that makes it even harder. I used to hang out in the main hall on the second floor of the White House around the time Chelsea would come home from school just to be sure I got to see her and see what happened that day and try to figure out what I needed to be thinking about and doing for her.\nAnd let's be real \u2013 as our first African-American First Lady, she's faced pressures I never did. And she's handled them with pure grace. By any standard, she has been an outstanding First Lady who has made us all so proud.\nAnd she and the President, she and the President have been such wonderful friends to me and my family. It has just meant the world, the world to me, it really has.\nI want to say just one thing about the First Lady's work. I mentioned military families. She's been their fierce champion. And military families have come up against a lot in this election. It just made me boil when Donald Trump disrespected a Gold Star family, Mr. and Mrs. Khan. He still hasn't apologized to them.\nHe actually made it worse \u2013 just yesterday, he said again that if America had only made him President years ago, their son, Captain Khan, would still be alive. Honestly, I don't -- I don't understand how anyone would want to rub salt in the wounds of a grieving family.\nAnd he keeps insulting our military. Yesterday, when he heard that a retired Army colonel and former dean of the Army War College said that Donald doesn't understand military strategy, Trump said, 'I'll teach him a couple things.' Well actually, Donald, you're the one who's got a lot to learn about the military and everything else that makes America great. Starting by learning about the dignity and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families. And he should learn from Michelle Obama how a leader supports them, not disrespects them!\nNo one knows the stakes in this election better than our First Lady. Because all the progress that we've achieved under President Obama's leadership is at stake \u2013 he pulled our economy out of the biggest ditch that it was in when he became president. He saved the auto industry, he cracked down on Wall Street, he has tackled healthcare, climate change, civil rights, and so much else.\nAnd all the work that we've done to strengthen our relationships with other countries and secure our leadership in the world is also at stake.\nNow, I for one, and I hope all of you, do not want all that hard work \u2013 by our President and our First Lady and by millions of Americans \u2013 to be wiped away. We cannot let that happen.\nWe've got to do everything in our power to get everyone out to vote. To understand no matter what issue you care about, it truly is on the ballot. Now, this has been a hard election at times. It's gotten pretty ugly, hasn't it? We've all felt it \u2013 especially our kids.\nI hear this from parents and children across our country \u2013 kids write me notes, they hand me little cards and notes when I shake hands with them. Their parents write to me, teachers talk to me. Kids are scared, kids are scared by the rhetoric they're hearing, right? I see the educators' heads nodding.\nLittle girls hear the ugly things that have been said about women in this campaign, and it makes them feel terrible and doubt themselves \u2013 and that is why it is important for voices, like our First Lady's, to stand up and say, 'Wait a minute, respecting women and girls is so important,' and it is especially important for us to send that message to our children, boys and girls alike.\nOur kids are scared that they're going to be sent out of the country because their parents are immigrants or they're immigrants. They're scared if they're Muslim, or have a disability. I got a letter from a parent -- a mom from Wisconsin, I think, who adopted her son Felix from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He just turned 11 years old \u2013 he wrote my campaign to let me know he was now 11 years old. I love it when little kids do little birthday remembrances. America is the only country he's ever known. One day, he turned to his mom and asked, 'If Donald Trump becomes President, is he going to make me go back to Ethiopia?'\nNow that honestly breaks my heart. We've got to make sure all our kids know that America has a place for you -- the American Dream is big enough for you. And then, we've got to make sure they learn the right lessons about how to treat people. I saw that sign, I believe in love and kindness, right?\nWell, here's one place to start. We know that bullying is a real problem in our classrooms, our playgrounds and online \u2013 and teachers have reported that this election has made it worse. So I want you to know, we're going to launch a major new effort to help states and communities and schools and families end bullying wherever it takes places. And we will work together to make the internet a safer space for kids, invest in front-line professionals like guidance counselors and social workers and school nurses and psychologists to support kids who've been targeted, like the young woman I met in Iowa who told me she was bullied because of her asthma. This has got to stop. And I can't think of anything more important than making sure every single one of our kids knows that they loved just as they are.\nSo ultimately, my friends, as Michelle reminded us this election is about our kids, and in my case, my grandkids. Their lives and their futures -- nothing is more important to me than that. I've been fighting for kids throughout my career. I will fight for them every single day of my presidency. So we have a job to do.\nStarting right now, let's come together. Let's work together. And let's be hopeful and optimistic and unified in the face of division and hate. Bring people together in a spirit of mutual respect to solve shared challenges. Let's have each other's backs, lift each other up, not tear each other down.\nLet's go out and win this election to make sure we do exactly that \u2013 for Roy Cooper, Deborah Ross, and all of us. Let's make sure you vote early. Vote as soon as you can, vote this afternoon. I'm excited about what we're going to see happen here in North Carolina, and I am so excited to be introducing our amazing First Lady Michelle Obama!\n","50":"\nWow, tremendous. Wow. Thank you very much. Thank you. Unbelievable. People don't know, I worked in Ohio, did you know that? [applause]\nAnd I had a great experience. [applause]\nAnd if I didn't have a great experience starting out when I was very young, maybe I wouldn't be here right now, who knows? You need that, it was great for confidence also. In 12 days, we're going to win Ohio [applause]\nAnd we are going to win back the White House. [applause]\nA brand new poll from Remington Research highly respected has just a few minutes ago come out, and in Ohio we are right now, four points up. [applause]\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure, get out and vote, we don't wanna we don't wanna give this away.\nAUDIENCE: No!\nYou know, we have a movement going on like they've never seen before in this country. Drain the swamps, you've gotta a \"drain the swamp\" sign back there, we're going to drain the swamp, believe me. [applause]\nBut this is a movement like they've never seen in this country before, and every place is packed, and the greatest people on Earth, and we're going to turn our country around, we're going to turn it around fast. [applause]\nSeventy-five percent of the people think our country is headed in the wrong direction. We know it's headed in the wrong direction. We're going to fix it, we're going to take our country back, and it's going to be put very quickly on the right track. [applause]\nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause]\nIt's just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare, you see that. [booing]\nIncluding premiums like in the great state of Arizona, where they're going to go up at 116 percent. Don't worry, you'll be there very soon, unless I win in which case you're not going to have to worry about it. [applause]\nEven Bill Clinton admitted that Obamacare is quote, \"The craziest thing in the world, where people wind up paying their premiums which double, and their coverage is cut in half.\"\nJob killing [applause]\nJob killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. Remember the name Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare? [booing]\nHe said they could pass Obamacare when he didn't know he was being recorded he said they could pass Obamacare, because the stupidity of the American voter will allow it to take place. [booing]\nThe only stupidity was that incredible stupidity shown by our politicians when they forced this bill through over the furious objection to many politicians, in all fairness, many, many politicians, but really the American people. And it was very, very sad. And in all fairness to the Democrats, had our President not lied 28 times remember, you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor, it passed by this much they would not have gone for it. But they believed him too, like everybody else believed him.\nThey've caught them in a lot of lies lately, folks. Hillary Clinton, talking about liars, wants to double down [applause]\nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare and make it even worse. So, here, I'm going to repeal it, replace it. We're going to have a replacement that is so much less expensive and so much better. You don't even get to use Obamacare because the deductible is so high and, you know, it's just Look, it is so it is so out of control, you'll never get to use it. Four or five thousand dollars before you can start taking Just this and just happened, Hillary Clinton declared that Obamacare do you remember this not so long ago as one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our county. It's a total disaster. [booing]\nHere in Ohio, another five insurance companies are dropping out of Obamacare. Good luck, good luck in negotiations, folks. That means that all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very soon. Obamacare is really and you know this a catastrophe it's a catastrophic event for Ohio workers and is making it impossible for many parents to pay their bills, support their families, or get quality medical care to their children. Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November eighth. [applause]\nHave to win. Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, D.C. [applause]\nHillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phone calls, I mean 13, 13 phones, made them disappear, sometimes with a hammer. Right? Wrong, wrong. Let's get rid of these And then told the FBI she could remember 39 different times.\nThe Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the Deputy Director of the FBI, and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, a server we now know Obama knew about. Just found that out yesterday. WikiLeaks. The more e-mails WikiLeaks releases, the more lies between the Clinton Foundation, the Secretary of State's office, and the Clintons' personal finances, they all get blurred.\nJust today we read about Clinton confidante Doug Brand, bragging that he had funneled tens of millions of dollars to Bill Clinton, Inc., through the Foundation donations, paid speeches, and consulting contracts. Mr. Band called the arrangement unorthodox. The rest of us call it outright corrupt. In fact, the Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS.\nIf the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they'll do given the change to once again control the Oval Office. And we've had enough. Honestly, I think we've had enough of the Clintons, in all fairness. Right? Don't you agree? [applause]\nHad enough. I mean at what point, at what point do we say it? Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency. [applause]\nI propose a contract with the American voter that will end the corruption and give the government back to the people. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I'm about to say. If we win on November eighth, when [applause]\nOK, OK. When we win on November eighth. [applause]\nWe don't want to take it for granted, but we are winning in a lot of states, I have to say. The media now, they're going wild. The media's going wild. Because they're saying, you know, this guy's winning in Florida, he's winning in North Carolina, he's winning in Iowa, he's winning in Ohio. All right. When we win, right, we are going to Washington, D.C., and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]\nA lot of spirit in this room it's a good one. That includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. At the core of my contract is my economic plan. That plan can be summarized in three very beautiful words, especially for the people in this area and this room jobs, jobs, jobs.\nNo, it's terrible what's happened, what's happened in this area, what's happened in this country with jobs is terrible. Hillary Clinton promised to bring upstate New York 200,000 jobs when she ran for Senate. Instead the jobs left. They didn't come in, they left. She been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything. She's just made things worse, except for herself and her husband.\nForty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million Americans live in poverty. Nearly one in four Americans, in their prime earning years, are not working or able to work. Seventy million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty, and nearly half of African-American children under the age of six are living in abject poverty\nOur national debt has doubled in eight years, and our infrastructure throughout our country is crumbling, bad shape. Our airports, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals. Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Think of it. And that's so true. The single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nWhat our politicians have allowed to happen to this area, but to all areas of our country. NAFTA, TPP they want to approve. A disaster. Ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary Clinton. Remember, every time you see a closed factory, a wiped out community in Ohio, it was essentially caused by the Clintons. It was NAFTA. It was caused by the Clintons. Why a deal like that was allowed.\nWe've lost 70,000 factories. Think of that one, 70. I tell everybody, it's a typo. Can't be 70,000. It is. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. Just this year, Eaton Corporation in Ohio closed its plant, laid off 152 workers, and moved their jobs to Mexico. And you've had many. I could I could name them all day long.\nUnder my contract, if a company wants to fire their workers, move to Mexico or other countries, and ship their products back into the United States, we will put a 35 percent tariff on those products. [applause]\nAnd folks, just in case you have any questions, when that happens you're not losing your companies anymore. And if you do, at least the country's gonna make a lot of money. OK? We will immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want - right now it's a one-way highway. We lose our jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything. We lose our cash. They get the cash, they get the jobs, they get the companies. We get the drugs, we get the unemployment. That's what we get. We get nothing. We get less than nothing.\nWe will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers if we can't renegotiate it properly. We're gonna get a better deal for our workers and for our companies. Because we cannot continue to be the people led by stupid people. We can't. We can't. [applause]\nAs part of our plan to bring back American jobs we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35 percent down to 15 percent. We will also cut taxes for middle class families by 35 percent and massively simplify taxes for all Americans. We will be a rich nation once again. [applause]\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world, you know that story. And spreading violently, it's spreading now into the United States. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in the United States. ISIS is on a campaign of genocide against Christians in the Middle East, or what they call the Nation of the Cross. OK. The Nation of the Cross.\nThey are crucifying, drowning and beheading their victims. This is something that we would read about in history books. And not since medieval times, right? Have you heard the beheadings and all the things that are happening. So we have no choice. We will stop ISIS and we still stop them fast. [applause]\nAnd unlike what they've done in Mosul, which is turning out to be very difficult, we're not giving three and four months notice. We're coming in. We're coming in. You think General George Patton would say, \"We're coming in in three or four months, get ready\"? What a bunch. They're throwing people off buildings, hanging their victims from meat hooks. They're hanging their victims from meat hooks. The New York Post just published reports about ISIS crushing children to death and burning adults alive.\nNow Hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world, where ISIS operates, including a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees over and above the thousands and thousands that President Obama is taking. [booing]\nWe don't want ISIS in our country. The Hillary refugee plan would leave us with generations of terrorism, radicalism and extremism inside of our shores. I only want to admit people who will support this country and love its people. SO important. [applause]\nKeeping our families safe is the highest obligation of the president of the United States. A Trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions. And we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. That was easy. [applause]\nWe're not going to take the risk when it comes to the safety of the American people. No longer. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]\nHillary also said she wants totally open borders. [booing]\nNo one who supports open borders can ever serve as president of the United States. Totally open borders. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall. [applause]\nHave to. We have to.\nAudience: Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall.\nAnd who is going to pay for the wall? [applause]\nOne hundred percent. Mexico, in terms of our trade deficits, is making a fortune off the United States. Their leaders are doing a much smarter job. But you know what? We'll be happy with Mexico. Mexico's gonna be wonderful, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico, with China and with other - we don't even have good relationships now. They rip us off and we still don't get along. At least they should be nice to us. They're not even nice. They'll be nice.\nThousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Right here in Ohio. Sixty-year old Margaret Costleman was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant. Earlier that day her killer shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park. Police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime scene, but federal authorities refused to take him into custody, even though people were saying, \"Please, please don't let him out. Please take him in.\"\nThen there is the case of 90-year old Earl Olander, a Minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home. Earl's body was found with his hands bound behind his back with duct tape. A blunt force injury to his head. His killers had criminal records but they did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal. [booing]\nBut others that knew him and others that knew them were pleading, were pleading, \"Don't let them out. Don't let them into our society.\" I have a message for the cartels, the drug dealers and the gang members. When I win, your long reign of crime and terror and horror will come to a very beautiful crashing end. [applause]\nWe will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military. Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it's ever been. Did you know that? Because I know what you have here. You guys are good with Wright Patterson. Right? What a great place. But we're very depleted, we have old equipment. We will build brand new, modern, state of the art planes to fly right at 'em, right at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. We have a lot of veterans here today.\nI want to thank them for their service and let them know as president I have your back. Believe me. [applause]\nI have your back. We will. She just said, \"Make America great again, Mr. Trump.\" We will make America great again. Don't worry about it. We will. And it won't take too long. We will change our foreign policy. Hillary Clinton's policies in Iraq, Syria, Libya threw the Middle East into total turmoil. We're spending $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East while our own country falls into total disrepair. Now Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria, conflict with a nuclear power - Russia - which could very well lead to World War III.\nAnd the way she talks about Putin. She's always said she has no idea, but she's always saying Wikileak, it's Russia, and Donald Trump I have nothing to do with Russia.\nShe said maybe Donald Trump is involved in projects with the Russians. The answer's no, no. But what she does, she says Donald Trump and Russia. Look, look, she speaks so badly of Putin, nuclear country, she speaks so badly, I say and she uses it to keep trying to get votes.\nI said to myself you know, how do you speak so badly of somebody, I mean how are they going to ever get along? Wouldn't it be great if we actually got along with Russia and other countries? [applause]\nAnd we together went after ISIS and knocked the hell out of them? Wouldn't that be a good thing? [applause]\nBecause they want to get them out also. [applause]\nBut she speaks very badly of Putin, and I don't think that's smart, you know. You can be very tough, but you shouldn't be doing what she's doing. As her own team has said in Wikileaks, she has terrible instincts. To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership, it really is time. [applause]\nIt really is. [applause]\nCan you imagine four more years of Obama? That's what you got to [booing]\nIt's high taxes, it's high regulations, all these companies they can't even breathe with the regulations, unnecessary. It's ISIS all over the place. You know, she says she'll stop ISIS. Let me tell you, there was no ISIS. There was no ISIS. During her term, she created with Obama a vacuum in Iraq, ISIS formed, and then Obama called them the JV, junior varsity, right?\nWell they're not the JV anymore, folks. They're going to be no trouble, we are going to knock them so hard. But look, look, they're not the JV, and they weren't them. And now they're in 32 different countries. So she's saying we will get rid of ISIS. She wants to go back home and go to sleep, that's what she wants to do. [applause]\nDid you see where she got upset yesterday because I took a little while, just a few hours, to cut a ribbon to make sure my kids did a good job? We built the building by the way, under budget, and ahead of schedule. [applause]\nAnd she said Donald Trump got off the campaign trail. I mean I've been doing six, seven, eight things a day every single day. She's home sleeping half the time. [applause]\nI say she's definitely a low energy person. I said where is Hillary? I watched after the last debate, and after the second debate. She was tired, wow. [applause]\nShe walked off that stage, she had a lot of people around, they had a lot of people around her, which was smart. Everything will change in November. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days. [applause]\nWe're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\nWe're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. [applause]\nWe're going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. [applause]\nWe're going to rebuild our military, and take care of our vets. [applause]\nWe will support the truly great men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nWe are going to save our second amendment which is under siege. [applause]\nAnd we'll appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court, so important, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nAmericans are tired of being told by politicians they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade. It's like our politics are caught in time loop. We keep electing the same people over and over again, Clinton, Clinton, oh, Clinton, the impeachment, the lying, the whole thing.\nWe're going to keep make the same mistakes if you keep doing that, and we are going to continue to hear the same old excuses. These career politicians keep telling us that things can't change, that we can't find new solutions. That's basically what they tell us.\nWell I have a message for them. The future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics, and not the critics. The future belongs to the dreamers. [applause]\nI'm asking all Americans to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. I'm going to fight for every American, of every background, in every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty, and crime and fear.\nAnd I'm going to fight for the inner cities, and for the African- American community, and the way they're forced to live in the inner cities with no jobs, no education, and no safety. [applause]\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors, and not the special [applause]\nI'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together again as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause]\nThat's right, once again we will have a government of, by, and for the people. [applause]\nYou gotta get out and vote. It's going to be something special. And I tell you this, and I tell others this sometimes, this is amazing group of people, the spirit, the energy, the genius, the genius. But you will say that this will be one of the great and most important meetings of your life, but most importantly, you will say that this vote will be the most important vote you've ever cast. [applause]\nBecause our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win with trade, we don't win with our great military, we don't allow them to win, we don't win with ISIS\nThe world is laughing at us. We don't win at the borders. We don't win with taking care of our vets. We don't win with anything. We don't win anymore. We will start winning again like you've never seen before. [applause]\nAnd I kiddingly say that one of our great two congressmen that are here someplace where are those great guys? They're here. They're going to be coming to see me at the White House, and they're going to say Mr. President, Mr. President sir, Mr. President [applause]\nThe people of Ohio, they can't take it anymore, sir. You're winning too much.\nYou knocked out ISIS, there are too many jobs in Ohio, too many companies are pouring in. We have a little traffic. Traffic wouldn't be a bad thing [applause]\nWe are going to win like never before. [applause]\nWe are going to make our country wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\nThank you very much. Thank you, everybody. [applause]\nMake sure you go out and vote. God bless you. God bless you. [applause]\n","51":"\nIt is great to be here in Charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to me.\nThat is the issue of urban renewal, and the rebuilding of our inner cities.\nToday I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class, and to provide a new deal for Black America. That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs.\nMy vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign: America First.\nEvery African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first.\nI'm asking today for the honor of your vote, and the privilege to represent you as your President. Here is the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. I have no special interest, I take no orders from donors or lobbyists \u2013 I work for you, and only you.\nOur campaign is about change, optimism, and the future. I am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past, and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future.\nOur opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday. Her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets, that nothing can ever really change.\nHillary has been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything \u2013 she's just made it worse.\nAmerican politics is caught in a time loop \u2013 we keep electing the same people, who keep making the same mistakes, and who keep offering the same excuses.\nThe fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime.\nEvery day I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking. And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new.\nI have a message for all the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics.\nAnd it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country.\nAfrican-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation. They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights.\nYet, too many African-Americans have been left behind.\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.\n58% of African-American youth are not currently employed.\nAfrican-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22.\nIn 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent \u2013 and it's expected to rise 24% in 2016.\nIn the city of Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January of this year.\nThe conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable.\nThe Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years or more. They've run the school boards, the city councils, the mayor's offices, and the congressional seats. Their policies have failed, and they've failed miserably.\nThey've trapped children in failing government schools, and opposed school choice at every turn.\nThe Clintons gave us NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina. This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA, decimating the African-American middle class.\nDemocratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence.\nThen there is the issue of taxation and regulation. Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy, have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities. Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent \u2013 which will only drive more jobs out of your community, and into other countries.\nOne of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration. Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans. No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers. Hillary's pledge to enact \"open borders,\" \u2013 made in secret to a foreign bank \u2013 would destroy the African-American middle class.\nAt the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade. Massive, chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs. Just look at what has happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and right here in North Carolina. It's the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nIf I'm President, and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a simple call. I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35% tax on their product before they ship it back into the United States. We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore. When we stop the offshoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home \u2013 meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable.\nAt the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores. It also includes a massive middle class tax cut, tax-free childcare savings accounts, and childcare tax deductions and credits.\nI will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment, and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.\nI will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities. Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need. The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession \u2013 through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie. It's time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.\nWe will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans.\nThen there is the issue of public safety. Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration.\nI have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system, and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only one set of rules \u2013 not a two-tiered system of justice. The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, lie to Congress and the FBI \u2013 put our national security at grave risk \u2013 and not even face so much as a fine.\nEqual justice also means the same rules for Wall Street. The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable.\nWe will also police our streets. I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right. The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not merely a goal \u2013 but a necessity. We will get it done. The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless, and dangerous, and puts African-American lives at risk. We must work with our police, not against them.\nOn immigration, my policy is simple. I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration. I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws, and suspending refugees, will be re-invested in our inner cities. It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country.\nInfrastructure will be another major goal. My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary.\nI will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations. These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities.\nSchool choice is at the center of my plan. My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states. I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job. My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities, more affordable 2 and 4-year college, and support for trade and vocational education.\nFinally, today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty, the promotion of family, and support for the African-American church.\nThis is just the beginning. Because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted. It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow. The cycle of poverty can be broken, and great new things can happen for our people.\nBut to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites in Washington who've been wrong about virtually everything for decades.\nThe people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA, and opening our markets to China, would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation. Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache.\nThe people opposing us are the same people who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering \u2013 imagine if that money had been spent at home.\nMy opponent unleashed ISIS on the world. She tried to build Democracy in Libya, and failed. She tried to build Democracy in Iraq, and failed. She tried regime change in Egypt, and failed. She pressed regime change in Syria, and failed. She tried a Russian Reset that failed. She tried an Asia Pivot that failed. Now, Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III.\nFinally, our opponents passed a healthcare law, embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter. Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system \u2013 premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona. Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing. Every prediction they made about this law was a lie. If we don't repeal and replace this disastrous law, we will lose our healthcare system forever.\nNow is the time to embrace a New Direction.\nI've been very lucky and have led a great life. Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me. I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction. It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world, and a great symbol for our country. I took two hours to fly into Washington, to cut the ribbon with my children, and then jump on the plane to be here with you. I wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, and support their children. They did a great job on the hotel, and I told them so. Likewise, the workers did a magnificent job -- without them, it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully. The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country.\nI want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities, and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization. I'm tired of the excuses from our politicians. I'm tired of being told what can't be done. I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day, but really another decade.\nEnough waiting. The time is now. There is nothing we can't accomplish. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside our reach.\nEverywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free. But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again. We have to choose the more optimistic path \u2013 we have to choose to believe not in our politicians, but to believe in ourselves and in our country. If we do that, anything is possible.\nI'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington, and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone.\nI am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln. And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again.\nTogether, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nAnd we will Make America Great Again For All Americans.\n","52":"\nThank you so much! Thank you. Wow, thank you all. What a great way to celebrate my birthday being here in Tampa!\nI am so, so grateful to Jos\u00e9 for that wonderful introduction. He's an incredibly talented chef, but more than that, I have to say he's a humanitarian. He just came back from Haiti, once again, where he goes periodically to help feed people. He's been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake, going to help people in remote villages \u2013 and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cookstoves so that people can cook, primarily women and children, without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke. I enlisted Jos\u00e9's help when I was Secretary of State on the clean cookstoves initiative. And as you heard, he's also a proud immigrant and \u2013 he is standing up to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, and he's doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business. He'd been asked by the Trump Organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that Trump was talking about on TV today, in Washington, and after Jos\u00e9 heard the kinds of things that Donald Trump was saying about immigrants, he said, 'No, I refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel.' That is really gutsy.\nAnd today was a perfect time to have Jos\u00e9 be with us because, as I said, Donald Trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel. And yesterday, here in Florida, he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them.\nAnd today, in opening that hotel, I think it's important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers. The same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign. So, like with so much else that Donald Trump says, he says one thing and then he does something different. Many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the United States, and he even sued the District of Columbia to pay lower taxes. That is the way that he does business.\nNow, we've actually learned in this campaign that Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy. He refuses to pay workers and contractors from Atlantic City to Miami to Las Vegas. He stiffs small businesses. I take that one personally because my dad was a small businessman. And I've met so many people who did projects for Donald Trump \u2013 provided pianos for one of his casinos, installed drapes for one of his hotels, laid the marble, put in the glass, washed the dishes, painted \u2013 and then weren't paid. I just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the Oval Office.\nSo I'm grateful to Jos\u00e9 and I want to thank everyone else \u2013 my great friend, your United States Senator Bill Nelson. Congresswoman Kathy Castor. Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who's here with his two daughters. Governor Charlie Crist, soon to be Congressman Charlie Crist. I have to say, we've got two great candidates here: David Singer, candidate for the House of Representatives; and Rena Frazier, another candidate. And we have the great talent of Angela Bassett with us today.\nSo, my friends, here's the advice that I got. It is a beautiful day in Tampa, but it's warm. And some of you have been here a while, right? And I'm watching the flags. So long as they're waving, I know there's a breeze. If they stop waving, I'm really going to cut this short.\nBut let me start by thanking you \u2013 thanking you for being here.\n[Chants of \"Hillary!\"]\nThank you. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you, if I ever need a pickup, I'm coming back to Tampa, Mayor. And with 13 days left in this election, we cannot stop for a minute. No complacency here. Nobody\u2014 nobody flagging. We've got to get everybody out to vote. And I hope in addition to the people that I've mentioned, someone who's not here I hope you will support \u2013 that is Congressman Patrick Murphy, to send him to the United States Senate.\nI think you'll be pleased because he's an independent voice. He's a problem-solver. He believes in comprehensive immigration reform. He has stood with Planned Parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered. He has even brought Democrats and Republicans together to try to protect our environment and fund Everglades restoration. He'll stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures. He'll defend Social Security and Medicare, not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs. So please, do your best to make sure we send Patrick Murphy to the Senate.\nNow, I got to ask you, anybody see the last debate? You know, I have now stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job.\nAnd every time he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a \u2013 yeah, 'Wrong' \u2013 he does have a way of saying, I just keep remembering Michelle Obama's words: when he goes low, we go high.\nBut I got to say, he said something in the last debate we've never heard from anybody running for president. He basically said that he's not sure \u2013 he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election. Now, this is a guy who said the Emmys were rigged, so you can't really take what he says very seriously. But this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on January 20th is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And if you are casting doubts, you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election, that is contrary to who we are as Americans. We have our elections; we've had them from George Washington forward. We're going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world.\nI believe strongly that the American people are going to reject this dark, divisive vision of America, and it's happening, my friends. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That's the biggest number ever. And that number includes 50 million young people. And you know what else? More than 10 million people have already voted, including 2 million right here in Florida.\nI'm hearing some great stories from people. Let me just tell you one. It's about Steven, from St. Augustine. He's been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease. He's been in and out of the hospitals a dozen times in the last two years. But he knows how important his vote is. So I heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank, which I would not have recommended \u2013 clung to his walker, stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better America. And if Steven can do that, nobody has any excuses. And I think this extends not just to Democrats but to Republicans and independents, and I am proud to have support from Republicans and independents here, across Florida, and across America who agree with me that we should reject hate and division.\nWe have seen Donald Trump insult nearly every person in America, and I just find that so intolerable. Because look at this diverse crowd; look at Tampa. It's a cosmopolitan city. Florida is paving the way for what our country will look like, and we need to be lifting each other up, listening to each other, respecting each other, not sowing seeds of hatred and bigotry. And I think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together, and I'm going to need your help.\nWe're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just people at the top, with new jobs in infrastructure. That rail system, Bob, that you want, we're going to get it because it would help you so much. Think of the people we'd put to work \u2013 technology, innovation, research, advanced manufacturing, and yes, small business. I want to be the best small business president you can have, to help people start and grow their businesses. But we're also going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I know we can create millions of jobs, and we can protect Florida, especially coastal Florida, and we can protect our planet at the same time. You're already seeing the results of climate change here in Florida. I was just in Miami, and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain. People are calling 3-1-1 because they think a water main broke, but it's the oceans rising. So I know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energy agenda than Florida, and that's exactly what we're going to do.\nWe're also going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. If your family makes less than $125,000, which is most families in America, you're not going to have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university. If your family makes more than that, you're not going to have to go into debt \u2013 pay what you can afford, and then we're going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt, because that drags people down. And for people who already have debt, we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off.\nAnd I want to say something to all of the teachers and educators. I want to work with you and be a good partner with you. And I think there should be more than one way, more than just a four-year college degree, to get a good job with a good middle-class life for you and your families. So let's invest in more technical education in high school, in our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs \u2013 labor and business together.\nBut while we grow the economy, let's make it fairer. We need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work full-time aren't left in poverty. I got to tell you, I was raised to believe in hard work. My grandfather was a factory worker, my dad had a small business, and we really believed you've got to work for what you get in life, right? But if you're working, you shouldn't be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year.\nAnd isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work? You know, this is not just a women's issue. This is a family issue. If you've got a mother, a wife, a sister, or a daughter working, it's your issue. And unlike my opponent, we're going to ask the wealthy, the millionaires and billionaires, to pay their fair share, because we're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter. And I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.\nSo when you go to the polls, vote to grow the economy, more jobs with rising incomes, vote to make the economy fairer. And compare that with what my opponent has proposed. He really believes if you give trillions \u2013 that's trillions with a 't' \u2013 trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, millionaires, billionaires, big corporations, everything will trickle down. Now, we know that doesn't work; we've seen it. And it's pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich, who hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes in 20 years. He says not making taxes makes him smart. Well, I don't know. I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in one year. And besides, what kind of genius loses money running a casino, for heaven's sakes?\nActually, it sounds like a few people have been at casinos here. But this means he's contributed zero, okay? He actually has the gall to call our military a disaster. Not only is he wrong, but what right does he have to say that? He hasn't contributed a penny to our military, not a penny to our veterans, not a penny to health care or education, not a penny to highways or infrastructure. This is a false \u2013 false \u2013 charge that he makes about all the problems in our country.\nAnd I'll tell you something; we did a little research. He's been denigrating America for decades. This didn't start with his birther lie against President Obama. It didn't even start running against me. Back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world. So this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself. And at some point, you got to say, wait a minute, we're better than that. We are stronger than that. We want to forward \u2013 forward \u2013 into the future with confidence and optimism, and that's what we're offering in this campaign.\nI got to tell you, it is not just what we're against that should motivate you to go to the polls; it's what we are for. And I believe strongly that what we're for will make it possible for all of us, and especially our kids and our grandkids, to have the best future. America's best days can still be ahead of us. But we can't make any of this happen if we don't have you voting.\nNow, Donald Trump says he can still win, and he's right. That's why it's so important everyone gets out and votes. And here in Florida \u2013 in a lot of places, you can only vote on Election Day, but here in Florida, voting couldn't be easier. Early voting began on Monday. In south Florida, it goes through Sunday, November 6 around the state. You can go to an early voting site between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. In fact, the County Center on East Kennedy Boulevard is just a 10-minute walk from here. You can go vote right after this event. And we'll have staff ready to help you get there. And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make a plan to vote.\nBut I also hope you will volunteer these last two weeks. We're reaching out to everybody. So go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. Take out your phone and text J-O-I-N, and that is 47246. We can use you. We're making millions of phone calls in Florida. We're knocking on maybe by the time we finish millions of doors.\nWe don't want anybody to be left out or left behind because on January 20th, America will have a new president. I've got to say \u2013 so I've got to say to you that change is inevitable in life. Right? And so the real question is, what kind of change are we going to have? And I want you to talk to anybody you know who is either thinking of not voting or maybe thinking of voting for my opponent. No. I'm serious. I'm serious. After this election, if I'm fortunate enough to be elected, we are going to reach out to everybody. Right? And ask. Ask the people you're talking to what kind of change they really want because I don't think most Americans want the kind of divisive and dark change Donald Trump is offering: mass deportations that will rip families apart, a repeal of gun-free school zones on day one, going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition, letting Wall Street write its own rules, denying the science of climate change, rolling back marriage equality, defunding Planned Parenthood, the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy, and abroad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons.\"\nAudience: \"No.\"\nClinton: \"Now, that may be change, but, boy, that's not the change we need. And my vision is different. It's more hopeful, optimistic, and unifying. I want us to be a country where every student could afford to go to college if that's what you choose. I want us to be a country where millions of people are working in good, high-paying jobs and in new industries, like clean energy and advanced manufacturing. I want us to be a country where hard-working immigrants, who pay taxes \u2013 and, by the way, one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump paid. And a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare, where we're respected in the world, working with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons. So yes, change is coming, The choice is yours about what kind of change we'll have.\nAnd I hope you will choose to be part of this campaign because it's not just about winning on November 8th, as important as that is. It is about getting to work because I do believe we are stronger together.\nTim Kaine and I wrote a book laying out our agenda because I think you deserve to know what I will try to do as your president. So if you will help, we will come together to give every American the chance to chart your own future and contribute to our great country.\nLet's prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you.\n","53":"\nHello, Broward County!Whoa. It is so great to be back in Florida. There are just 14 days, two weeks from today.\nThe most important election in our lifetimes. I'm so grateful to see all of you and I want to thank the elected officials who are here, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schult,\nCongressman Alcee Hastings, Congressman Ted Deutch, Commissioner Mark Bogen and others who are here, along with Senator Bill Nelson's wonderful wife, Grace Nelson. So we are glad you are all here with me.\nAnd I got to tell you, I was thrilled to be introduced by the person I hope will be the next senator from the great state of Florida, Congressman Patrick Murphy.You know, I think Patrick is exactly the kind of senator that Florida needs and deserves because he will help us break through gridlock and create more good jobs with rising incomes. And Patrick knows we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.\nI also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system, do you agree? But it's going to take strong and committed leaders, like Patrick Murphy, who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done. And -- and this is important, my friends, unlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nI think Florida deserves a senator who's going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force.\nThis is what is so unimaginable, of law enforcement officials to go door to door, house to house, business to business, school to school, rounding up 11 million people. I think that is so wrong, and it is not going to happen in America. So you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real, as opposed to someone who every time he's asked says, well I'm not a scientist. And I always wonder, why don't you talk to a scientist? Like start here at Broward College, you could talk to scientists.\nAnd you deserve a senator who would never say that Social Security and Medicare have, and this is a quote, \"weakened us as a people.\"\nHis solution, Patrick's opponent's solution, is to privatize Medicare.\nAudience: Boo!\nClinton: That is exactly the right response, but don't boo, vote, right?\nAnd you deserve a senator who would never support cutting $360 million from Florida's schools, because Patrick knows every child in Florida deserves a world-class education. So my friends, Patrick Murphy is a smart, tough-minded legislator and an independent voice.\nThat's what we need more of in Washington, people like Patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you, a better life for you and your families, instead of blocking progress at every turn, listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what it's going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead.\nSo please, when you get out and vote, please remember you can send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate, and you will be glad you did.\nNow, I know there's an overflow crowd outside and I'm so sorry they can't be in, but I'm told that they can hear us and maybe even see us, and I want to thank them for coming as well.\nI got to ask you, did anybody see the last debate?\nWell, the good news -- the good news was, it was the last debate.\nAudience: Happy birthday to you!\nClinton: Well, thank you!\nThank you. Yeah, you know, you're right. That last debate was like an early birthday present, right? But here's what I wanted you to remember. I stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving once again I have the stamina to be president and commander- in-chief.\nYou know, I tried as much as I could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that I believe we can work together to improve. And in fact, my wonderful running mate I, Senator Tim Kaine, wrote a book, called \"Stronger Together,\" and we put all of our policies in it because I want you to know what we're going to try to do if we're so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president.\nAnd I think it's important, because I want you to have confidence that we're going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth. And I tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with Donald Trump, who doesn't really have very many plans. You know, I've tried to run a campaign based on issues, he's run a campaign based on insults. And so in the debate, we didn't have a lot to talk about, other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults.\nBut in that last debate, he said something that I found horrifying. Well, he said a lot of things, cut there's one thing in particular that I wanted to point out because no presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, has ever said this. He refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election.\nI guess we shouldn't be too surprised, this is the same guy who said he thought the Emmys were rigged against him. But this is serious. You know, on January 20th, the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and I have serious doubts about whether Donald Trump even understands what that means.\nIn America, we don't say we're going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election. We have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power. That is one thing that makes American great, it makes America who we are.\nAnd we don't impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty. And we don't punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians, or threaten to restrict the First Amendment, because our democracy depends on a free press. And we don't incite violence and turn people against each other. We respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on.\nYou know, I've got to say, I bet some of you or maybe your parents, or your grandpar-ents, came from places where none of that was true, right? There is a reason why America is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known, because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love, you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the United States.\nAnd Donald Trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for 240 years. Now, after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of Americans after another -- immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, women, POWs, Muslims, people with disabilities -- now his final target is democracy itself. So here's what I want you to know, in the four years, we are going to change some things in America, right?\nI do want to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. And we're going to do that, along with other positive changes, but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.\nYou know, I think it all started -- I think this all started when George Washington re-fused to become a king. Right? Now, Donald Trump probably would have called him a loser.\nInstead, that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made. Eight years, it's time to move on. We fought a revolution so that we would not have a king. We would not be subjects, we would be independent citizens. I cherish that idea.\nSo here's the good news. Americans are coming together. At the very moment when Donald Trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy, millions of people are registering, voting early and volunteering in this campaign.\nAnd here's something very exciting. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered, and that includes 15 million young people, the most ever in history.\nAnd you know what? More than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in Florida.\nSo I think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in, and that includes not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents coming together to reject hate and division, and I am so excited about what that means.\nBut the energy we are seeing across Florida and America is not just because of what we are against, it's about what we're for. It really is. It's about fighting for that future where everyone counts, everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind. But I want you to know we still have a lot of work to do. I feel good, but boy, I am not taking anything for granted. I'm going to work as hard as I can between now and the close of the election that's two weeks from today.\nAnd you know, it's so important for Florida. There are so many issues that we need to remind people about. Last time I was here, I campaigned with Al Gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis. And you know why? Because we're seeing the reality of climate change every day in Florida. We are seeing areas in Miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding. And the ocean is rising.\nAnd what we've got to do is make sure that this issue -- fighting climate change, creating clean renewable energy jobs -- stays at the top of the priorities, and that's why you need a new senator like Patrick Murphy.\nI have to say, nobody should want to wake up on November 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done. I hope you will wake up on November 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an America that belongs to all of us, where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them.\nI got to tell you, I believe America is great because America is good.\nAnd I want to tell you one other thing. I want to say one other thing that's really very important to me. We should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country.\nThat's why I was so appalled when Donald Trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote him, \"a total disaster\" and that our country is, again a quote, \"looking dumb.\" Really? He's declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He's proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military.\nHere's another example. He was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them. And when asked specifically about Israel, he said, and I quote again, he would \"love to be neutral.\"\nNow, we can't have a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because in his mind, everything is negotiable.\nI have a different view. We stand with our allies. We stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism.\nSo I -- I get pretty excited about what we could to together. And with your help, we're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II -- jobs in infra-structure and advanced manufacturing, and clean renewable energy, and small busi-nesses. I want us to make America the clean energy super power of the 21st century.\nWe can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time. And I've got to say no state, no state should care more about this issue than Florida. Right? And you know, I'll tell you something that it's kind of sad, to be honest with you. I've traveled all over the country. And in New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have more solar power than the Sunshine State.\nWhy? Well, because you have a governor and a legislature who, like your current senator, doesn't want to believe the science of climate change; doesn't see the opportunity that Florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy.\nAnd so I want to deploy a half-billion more solar panels by the end of my first term, and enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.\nAnd we're also going to strengthen education at every level, starting with universal pre-K, and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code. And here's what I want all the students to hear, we're going to make college more affordable for everyone.\nYou know, after our primary, which was hard-fought, and I was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues. Senator Sanders and I got together, came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.\nThat's the vast majority of families. And if you're over that, we're going to make it debt-free. So pay what you can afford. But I don't want to see young people and their families going into debt. I view this as an investment. And that's why we're going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt -- pay it down and pay it off.\nAnd I also want more pathways to good jobs that don't require a four-year college de-gree. Let's return technical education to high schools. Let's do more with our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.\nAnd you know, in addition -- in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs, I want to make it fairer. That's why I want to raise the national minimum wage. If you work full-time, you shouldn't still be in poverty. And don't you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\nAnd, you know, I always tell crowds, this is not a women's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister or a daughter working, it's your issue. And that's why we have got to get this fixed once and for all.\nAnd let's make childcare affordable. And let's have more profit sharing. And let's do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up. Now, you know, when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues, you know, Donald Trump or somebody always says, well, there she goes playing the woman card. And I've got to tell you, I don't believe that's what it is. I think we're paying -- playing the smart card.\nBecause we want everybody's incomes to go up. That's how we're going to get this economy really moving forward, creating new jobs. And so if that's playing the woman card, you know what we say, deal me in.\nI've also said I will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, because we don't need to do that. We can go where the money is, the millionaires and the billionaires, the corporations, to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy.\nWe're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi- millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher.\nNow remember when we learned in one of the debates that Donald Trump hadn't paid any federal taxes?\nFor about 20 years is the best guess we've got, and his excuse, I love his excuse, his excuse was well, he lost $1 billion in a year.\nI've been really pondering this. How does anybody lose $1 billion in a year, especially when you're running casinos? Think about it. Has anybody here ever been to a casino?\nAudience: Yes!\nClinton: Well, you know, usually they say the house wins, so Donald Trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes. Well, if losing $1 billion is smart, I think that's kind of upside down and backwards. I think people should be working hard to make their incomes, to support their families, and that's what we're going to do because we don't want the kind of values that Donald Trump used in running his business to be in our government.\nHe stiffs -- he stiffs small businesses. My dad was a small business owner. Donald Trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks, workers, small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass, or where he bought pianos, he didn't pay them. He just doesn't pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well, go ahead and sue me.\nWell, my dad, because he was a small business man, I know he could never have afforded that, so I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, because our family would have been hurt by that.\nSo here's the bottom line and here's what I need you to do. We have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote, and you have early voting now and it's going to be much easier for some of you to vote early. And if you believe in any of the issues that we have talked about in this campaign, if you believe that women and girls should be treated with respect, if you believe that marriage equality should be protected.\nIf you believe -- if believe in science and believe we should take action, if you believe America belongs to everybody willing to work for it and we should stand up against any kind of negative tax, then I hope you will come out and vote because it's going to be a close election. Pay no attention to the polls. Don't get -- don't get complacent, because we've got to turn people out.\nSo I'm asking you to vote for me, I'm asking you to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate, I'm asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves, because really, that's what is at stake. So early voting began here in south Florida yesterday. It goes through Sunday, November 6th. You can go to your early voting site in your county between 7 AM and 7 PM. In fact, you can go across the street right now to the North Regional Library and cast your ballot today.\nAnd we have volunteers and staff ready to escort you, so hey, go ahead and vote now. And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make sure you have a plan to vote. But don't stop there. If you will join us in these next two weeks, every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So please, go to HillaryClinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text JOIN to 47246, and get involved, because the bigger the turnout, the bigger statement we will make about the kind of country we are and the future we want to build together.\nNow, let me just end by saying that people ask me all the time, you know, what moti-vates you, how do you do this day after day? And you know, look, I love this country, and I feel blessed. I feel blessed, and I want everybody to have the same chance to go after your part of the American Dream, and I think the American Dream is big enough for everybody.\nI think a lot about my two grandchildren, because obviously, I would do anything to help them, but it's not just them. I want to help everybody's children and grandchildren, because the kind of country we will have when they become adults will be affected by the decisions we make now on education, on healthcare, on ending the epidemic of gun violence, on getting the cost of prescription drugs down, on preserving and protecting Social Security and Medicare, doing what we must to make sure we're passing on a country that provides the same level of opportunity to all who come after us.\nSo please join me. This is bigger than me, it's bigger than any of us. It's even bigger than Donald Trump, if you can believe it.\nThis is a crossroads election that's going to determine so much about what kind of country we have in the decades ahead. I want to wake up in the White House with your help, making it my mission to do everything I can to give every person, and particularly every child, the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.\nIf you will stand with me, if you will work with me over the next two weeks, let's go out and build the kind of future we want for ourselves, for our kids, and let's prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you all very much.\n","54":"\nThank you \u2013 Wow! Well, I don't know about you, but I could listen to Elizabeth Warren go on all day! It is so great to be back here in New Hampshire! I have a significant unruly group of women I went to Wellesley with back here.\nOh, it is so wonderful to be here on this college campus, and to see so many young people here as Maggie and Elizabeth and I were walking up to the stage. And a lot of people were hanging out of the windows, and we're glad that you've got the best view of what we're doing here.\nIt's also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime, and to see the energy and enthusiasm that this crowd displayed \u2013 I saw it yesterday in North Carolina, I saw it the day before in Ohio, it really does demonstrate that Americans are really looking at what's at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved in the remaining days of the campaign. And that everyone needs to turn out to vote.\nIn New Hampshire, you have a lot of reasons to vote \u2013 you've got great candidates for Congress, Annie Kuster and Carol Shea Porter, who deserve your support, and you've got a great candidate for governor, Colin Van Ostern, thank you!\nI know that Maggie, and Elizabeth and I have been out here giving the full dose, but I hope that you will know what is at stake in the governor's race, and in sending these two extraordinary women to the House, and boy, it is exciting to be here with Maggie and Elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day. I know these women, and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them.\nNow, Elizabeth Warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against Wall Street. And she is going to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again!\nBut you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it was set up to stand against and to do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse we've seen from Wells Fargo. And they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to Americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies, by banks and others.\nIn fact, I think it is fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on C-SPAN when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or regulator. She is refusing\u2014 refusing to let them off the hook, and she is not just speaking for herself, is she? She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up. And I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in America.\nI know we are up here without our phones so we cannot check tweets but \u2013 I kind of expect if Donald heard what she just said, he is tweeting away. She gets under his thin skin like nobody else. Whether she is calling him out of his mysterious tax returns, she exposes him for what he is \u2013 temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States. And Maggie is going to be a great United States senator for New Hampshire. You do not have to take my word or Elizabeth's word. Look at what she has already done. Under Maggie's leadership, New Hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country.\nDuring her governorship, it was ranked as the best state in the country for business, and she has done it the New Hampshire way. She has brought people together, Democrats and Republicans, and Independents, and I think she has the biggest legislature, probably in the world, that she has to deal with. So she has really honed her skills \u2013 listening and trying to work with people, and she has taken issues that do keep families up at night. From the sky rocketing costs of college and prescription drugs , to helping students to figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health, to raising wages for hard working families. What I love about Maggie is that she is independent, she knows how to find common ground, and how to stand her ground. And that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the United States Senate.\nBecause we've got to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that has unfortunately marred Washington. We have to get back to listening respectfully. We can disagree without being disagreeable. And that is why we need leaders like Maggie, and unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nShe knows he should not be a role model for our kids or anybody else for that matter. So I hope in these next 14 days, you do everything you can to support her. And I want to say a word about Colin, who I have also known for a number of years now. And Maggie is leaving some big shoes. She does not look like it, but she is, she is leaving some big shoes to fill as governor. Colin is the person for that job. You know as a member of Executive Council, and I remember this because it took a lot of guts.\nHe helped lead the fight for funding Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire. Against his opponent by the way, and he has showed that he will stand up for women's health 100 percent of the time, not just when it is politically convenient. He also worked with Maggie to cross party lines to help expand Medicaid to more than 50,000 granted stators.\nAnd Colin wants to do more to invest clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in New Hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state. And he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families. So please during these next days, make sure you're doing everything you can for Colin, for Carol, and for Annie.\nNow did anybody see the last debate? I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again, I have the stamina to be president. I've tried to use the time I had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about, starting here in New Hampshire and going across the country, because I take it really seriously.\nI think that the problems that keep you up tonight, that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead, of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids, those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to, pay attention to and come up with solutions for.\nSo, you know, I do have a lot of plans, I do. And I get criticized for having so many plans. Tim Kaine and I have actually written a book \u2013 oh, there's one copy right there! It's called \u2013 oh, another copy! It's called 'Stronger Together,' and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if we're so honored as to be president and vice president. And, you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm here asking for your vote to be your president, I should tell you what I'm going to do, and maybe, as I said yesterday in North Carolina, maybe it's a bit of a women's thing because we make lists. We do, we make lists and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week. And so, I want you think about our plans are as our lists \u2013 our lists as a country.\nWe are going to get our economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We are going to make college affordable. We are going to lower prescription drug costs, and we're going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said we're going to do. What a novel idea! We're actually going to try to deliver results for you.\nBut I got to tell you. During that debate, Donald said something. Well, he said a lot of things that were troubling, but he said something truly horrifying. He became the first person running for president \u2013 Republican or Democrat \u2013 who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election. Now, that is a direct threat to our democracy. I'm not going to try to call it anything else because that's what it is. All this talk about the election being rigged, trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies, that is a direct threat to our democracy. And I got to tell you \u2013 as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries and I went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents, where they were exiled, where they were killed. I take this really seriously.\nAnd for me, the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great \u2013 something that \u2013 something we can't lose, something we shouldn't even doubt. We cannot give in to cynicism, and I don't think we are. I'll tell you what's exciting to me is across this country, at the very moment Donald Trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values, our institutions, millions of people are standing up for democracy, registering, volunteering, voting early.\nSo when you get a little discouraged or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign, think of this: we have just reached a historic milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered to vote. And most exciting, that includes more than 50 million young people, the biggest number ever. Now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and I'm proud to see Americans coming together \u2013 Democrats, Republicans and Independents \u2013 to reject hate and division. And we're seeing that in New Hampshire, too.\nWe are more than our disagreements, we Americans. There is so much more that unites us than divides us. I'm proud to have the support of more than 150 Republican leaders in this state who put country before party. But this energy we're seeing is not just because of what we're against, as important as that is, it's because what we're for. It's about fighting for a future where everyone counts, where everyone has a place, and no one is left out or left behind.\nBecause to me, and I hope to you as well, this is about more than winning an election, it's about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids. That's what this has to be about. It's about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters. You know, we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that America is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence. Yet my opponent attacked a grieving Gold Star family whose son died in Iraq. He has no plan to defeat ISIS. And just last night he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote, 'a total disaster.' And that our country is, quote, 'looking so dumb.' Imagine, imagine, this is a guy who says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. I don't think so. He's basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He's proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief. It's not only wrong, it's dangerous, and it needs to be repudiated on November the 8th here in New Hampshire and across America.\nBut just in case you think that this is new for Donald, it shouldn't surprise you or anybody else, and I'll tell you why. He has been denigrating America for decades. It started before he campaigned against me. It started before President Obama took office. In fact, back in 1987, he spent $100,000 on an ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said, and I quote, 'The world is laughing at America.' Does that sound familiar? This is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is. Now that may be who Donald Trump is, but this election is about who we are. And I want us \u2013 I want us to remember, America is great because America is good, right? And as our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama said right here in New Hampshire, 'When they go, we go high.'\nThis election poses a very clear choice on the economy. When the middle class thrives, America thrives. As Elizabeth said, she is a perfect example of how that works in America. So am I. So are every one of you here. That's what I want for every single person, especially young person, in America. With your help, we're going to not only have Elizabeth back in the Senate, but send Maggie, send Carol, send Annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.\nWhat does that mean? That means jobs in infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our mass transit, our water systems. There is a lot of great work to be done here. And guess what? Those are jobs that can't be exported. They've got to be done, right here in New Hampshire and across America. I want us to invest in advanced manufacturing, and there are, I know, a lot of skeptics about that. They say, 'Well, we can't compete in manufacturing anymore.' Well, I'll tell you what. I don't want us competing with low wage jobs. I want us competing for the high wage jobs. Germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products. I want to compete with Germany and countries like that, precision, machining, 3D printing.\nI want us to invest more in technology, innovation and research and yes, in clean energy, because we're going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of 10 years. That's what I want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve.\nAnd I am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young American is prepared. I want to start in the early years of life in early education, universal pre-K. I want kids to be prepared to succeed. Because we are in a competition, and you know what? I want us to step up and compete and win. And I want our schools \u2013 I want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code, and I want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in New Hampshire. And I want to bring back technical education to high school. I think we really \u2013 we really shut the door on too many young people who could've gotten skills that would've given them the chance to get ahead.\nAnd working with our community colleges, we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college. And yes, we are going to make four-year college affordable. Just this week, a new report came out showing that New Hampshire students have very high levels of debt, and I know Maggie has been fighting that. And she's had a moratorium, and she's done what she could at the state level. But we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in New Hampshire, families in New Hampshire.\nSo after our primary was over \u2013 and you know what, I was really proud \u2013 I was really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. And it was a campaign \u2013 it was a campaign about ideas, not insults. And that's what campaigns should be about. And after it was over, Bernie and I got together. We put our heads together. And we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And if you make more than that, it will be debt free. In other words, pay what you can, but let's not have kids and families going into debt to get an education. This should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country's future. And no matter where you go, to a great school like this, or anywhere else, we will help you pay down your student debt. We will make is easier, because we a re going to make it as a percentage of you income, so you will never be on the hook for more than you can afford. And if your interested to see how much you and your family can save, you can actually go to hillaryclinton.com\/calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing.\nNow, I think in addition to growing the economy, we need to do a lot more on small business. Two-thirds of new jobs will come from small business so we are going to be just focused on how we are going to be able to start and grow your small business. And then we do have to make the economy fairer, and that starts with raising the national minimum wage, because if you work full time, I am talking about full time workers, you should not still be in poverty at the end. Work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb. Right?\nWe are going to guarantee equal pay, we are going to make affordable child care so nobody pays more than 10 percent of your income for childcare. We are going to work for paid family leave. Because this is the way families are today. We are not living in the 1950s. Families are under new stresses and strains, and I meet so many who are really just at the edge. They are making all they can make. One parent working full-time, two parents working full-time, sometimes part-time on top of full-time.\nThe other day, Tim Kaine and I were in Pittsburgh. There was a long line of people, big overflow, which we couldn't get into the main room where we were. So, Tim was talking to the families there, and there was a woman holding her three-year-old child, a daughter, I think. Tim was shaking hands, and the woman looked and she said, 'I came here hoping that I could tell you or Secretary Clinton that I had my baby three years ago, and the day after, I had my baby, I was fired because I called and ask if I could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy. But my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be. I got fired.' And Tim came in, and he is such a wonderful man. What a fine human being. And he said, 'To be there are the reasons everyday why I get so motivated in this election, and I just have another reason.' He told me that story. I think your president should care about that. I think your president should wake up everyday thinking, 'Okay, how do I help empower the most people to make the most out of their own lives, how to break down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you?' Sometimes people say, 'How are you going to get all this done?' I have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because I see some of my long time friends who back in the 1992 campaign \u2013 where my husband ended up, we had a balance budget and a surplus, and actually, we were on the way to paying down the national debt, but here is what happened.\nWhat happened is trickle-down economics came back. So here is what I am going to do. We are going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share. We are going to \u2013 we are going to close the loopholes, we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer. We are going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because Elizabeth is absolutely right. No \u2013 no bank is too big to fail, and no one should be above the law, and we are going to enforce that and contrast that with Donald Trump. He believes that if you give trillions and that is trillions with a 't' in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and corporations, and everything will work out.\nWell, it will for him. That is trickle down economics on steroids. And he would wipe away the tough new rules that President Obama imposed on Wall Street. He would eliminate the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau that Elizabeth did so much to create. And you know that was bad enough, but then in the debates, we learned he hasn't paid any income tax for years. So he hasn't paid a penny to support our military, our veterans, Pell grants for kids to get an education, health or anything else. And his explanation was he lost a billion dollars in a year. Now, I've pondered this. I've really pondered this. He actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes, but how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year?\nHas anyone here been to a casino? He lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who does that? I've never heard of anybody. So, we've got to make it clear that Donald is not on the side of America workers or American families. For all of his talk about putting America first, he makes his products in at least 12 other countries. He stiffs small businesses, mom and pop contractors who work for him. My dad was a small business owner. He worked really hard. I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump because it was hard work, and people who do that work should be rewarded, not taken advantage of.\nSo we know a lot about how Donald Trump works, and today, today, we heard yet another story. It's about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses. This maintenance courses told his co-workers he was gay, and they started harassing him. They used anti-gay slurs to his face, they threw rocks and golf balls at him, his supervisor saw it and did nothing, and it got so bad, he wound up in the hospital. Finally, he went to the police for help. He couldn't go back to work because he was too scared for his safety, and then he was fired by Trump's golf club. Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination that too many LGBT Americans still face every day. And it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors, Trump's golf club turned on the victim for coming forward. If that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does that say about how he would run our country?\nSo my friends, there are lots of reasons, so many, to take this election seriously. But here's what I want you to know: of course, I want you to vote for all of us, but more than that, I want you to vote for yourselves, and for your families, and for your hope for our future together. Because if you believe women and girls should be treated with dignity and respect and women should be able to make our own health care decisions, and marriage equality should be protected, and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse, disorders, and addiction. If you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals towards peace and prosperity, then you have to vote. All of these issues are on the ballot this November, and I believe with all of my heart, that we will after this election, get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us.\nSo please register and vote on the same day. Go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. Come help us these last two weeks. Go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text 'JOIN,' J-O-I-N to 47246 and get everybody you know to come out and vote. I think this election is going to turn on who is motivated to vote so we need each and every one of you to do everything you can to make it clear to everybody you know that our future is at stake. If you ought to be part of a positive, optimistic, confident, unifying future, please come out to vote on November 8th here in New Hampshire, and prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you all!\n","55":"\nThank you.\nIt's great to be back here in beautiful Naples.\nIn 16 days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House.\nEarly voting begins tomorrow, and you can already get your absentee ballot, so make sure to start voting.\nYesterday, I outlined my Contract with the American Voter \u2013 a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy, safety to our communities, and honesty to our government.\nOne of the issues I addressed at length is the issue of government corruption. I put forward a plan to stop it; my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption. Even as she was preparing to run for President, WikiLeaks emails show, Hillary was trying to get $12 million from the King of Morocco in yet one more Pay-For-Play scheme.\nMy goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics. Hillary Clinton's goal is to put the Oval Office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest price.\nSo I have a message today to the voters of America. It's a message for Republicans, Democrats and Independents. It's a message for those living in rural America, urban America and suburban America \u2013 because we are all just One America.\nIt's a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interests.\nAnd my message is this: if we win on November 8th, we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to Drain The Swamp Of Corruption In Washington, D.C.\nThat change includes a new foreign policy that puts America First.\nHillary Clinton's foreign policy has squandered trillions in American wealth overseas. Yet, for all the money spent, all Clinton delivered was death, destruction and terrorism. She unleashed ISIS and turmoil in Iraq, Syria and Libya.\nNext, trigger-happy Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria that could involve nuclear-armed Russia \u2013 she has bad judgment, bad instincts, and is just too reckless to be allowed into the Oval Office.\nHillary also started the negotiations that led to the Iran deal \u2013 and thus ultimately leading to the $1.7 billion ransom for American hostages.\nClinton gave Iran everything they wanted and more \u2013 including Iraq. Now, Iran is emboldened as never before.\nIn the latest insult to America, the government of Iran is demanding \"many billions,\" in new ransom payments for an American businessman and his ailing father. Adding to the insult, Iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of American soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpoint.\nThe humiliation for our country never seems to end \u2013 and it's the humiliation brought on by a Secretary of State who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries, than in representing the country she lives in.\nTo cover-up her crimes as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phones disappear \u2013 some with a hammer \u2013 and then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times.\nThe best evidence that the system is rigged is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for President in the first place.\nThe Clintons grew their gross income by $60 million while Hillary was Secretary of State. She's not a diplomat \u2013 she's a grifter, always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cash.\nThe Clintons end up with the money, and America ends up with the humiliation.\nWhen I am President, America will be respected in the world once again.\nThat also means standing up against the oppression of the Castro regime in Cuba, and standing in solidarity with freedom-loving people in Venezuela and across Latin America living under oppression. The Obama-Clinton Administration has abandoned our friends in Latin America, and delivered only poverty and joblessness for Hispanic-Americans here at home.\nIf you elect me, along with a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. It's part of my 100-day plan.\nThis will be a national effort that will involve everywhere from Key West to Tampa to the Space Coast to Jacksonville to the Panhandle.\nMy proposal is based on three crucial words: Peace Through Strength.\nThis defense build-up will be supported by ships in Mayport, and by engineers and advanced manufacturing on the Space Coast. New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola.\nNew Navy and Coast Guard ships will patrol the Florida coast to prevent drugs and terrorists from entering our shores.\nWith a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is \"the craziest thing in the world,\" where \"people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\"\nReplacing Obamacare is part of my 100-day contract with the American Voter.\nA Republican House and Senate can swiftly enact the other items in my contract immediately, including massive tax reduction and tax simplification for the middle class. My plan to transform our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies is the most pro-growth plan in American history. It includes lowering our business tax from 35 to 15 percent. My reform plan will lift millions out of poverty, raise wages dramatically, and create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years \u2013 and we can enact the whole plan in our first 100 days.\nA Trump Administration will also work alongside you to restore and protect the beautiful Florida Everglades. Our plan will also help you upgrade water and wastewater systems so that the Florida Aquifer is pure and safe from pollution.\nWe will also repair the Herbert Hoover Dike in Lake Okeechobee.\nMy contract includes something else at the very center of this campaign: fixing our trade deals and ending the offshoring of American jobs.\nOne more way our system is rigged against the American Worker is that companies, like Carrier, simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico and other countries.\nWhen I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for other countries, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States.\nWe have a nearly $800 billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world. 1 in 5 American households don't have a single person in that household with a job.\nFlorida has lost 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nWe've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nA Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving our country.\nWe will start making things in America.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nImmigration security is national security.\nHillary's pledge for \"open borders\" includes an open border with the Middle East \u2013 meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within your communities and near your families.\nA new WikiLeaks email shows John Podesta secretly worried about the fact that Hillary Clinton never put procedures in place to keep the San Bernardino shooter out of America \u2013 including a plan to review social media postings. We're letting in Radical Islamic Terrorists right through the front door, and stamping their visas \"approved\" on the way in.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can.\nIf I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nAll across our nation, innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals who should never have been in our country.\nKate Steinle was gunned down in her father's arms in broad daylight on a San Francisco pier. Her killer had been deported 5 times before.\n90 year-old Earl Olander was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records and left on the floor of his home to die.\nLaura Wilkerson's teenage son, Josh, was tortured and beaten to do by an illegal immigrant he offered to give a ride home. His body was viciously burned.\nThe examples go on and on and on.\nUnder a Trump Administration, this crime wave will come crashing to an end.\nThat includes the proposal, in my contract, for tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after a previous deportation.\nWith a victory in November, everything will change.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nthe biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 16 days to make this all happen \u2013 but you have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me elect a Republican Congress to enact my 100-day America-First action plan.\nOur failed establishment will be replaced with a new government guided by the principles I outlined in my contract with the American Voter.\nIt will be a government of, by and for the people.\nFor those who feel like they don't have a voice, I have a simple reply: I Am Your Voice.\nI'm going to fight for every American in every last part of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people \u2013 not the donors and special interests.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.\nThis is a movement like the world has never seen before.\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most\nimportant vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n","56":"\nSecretary Clinton: \"We are really happy to campaign together. As you know, Tim has been doing the most amazing job around the country hitting every state multiple times along with Ann, his extraordinary wife, who has been campaigning tirelessly on her own as well.\nSo we don't get a lot of chance to actually gather because we want to cover more ground together. But today was a real opportunity for us.\nI just want to make two quick points. First, as we are traveling in the last 17 days, we are going to be emphasizing the importance of electing democrats down ballot.\nAnd in particular, as I said today, we are strongly supportive of Katie Mcginty in her race for the senate. We will be, I think, meeting up with her in Philadelphia tonight. So we will have a chance to do that with her. I will be doing the same as we go from state to state, as will Tim.\nThe other point is today, we are making our closing arguments. We are talking about what is at stake in the election we are drawing contrasts, but we are giving people something to vote for, not just against.\nAnd I saw where our opponent Donald Trump went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said, if he's president, he will spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior.\nTim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we are given the great honor of serving as president and vice president. As we said in the book, \"Stronger To-gether\" we have very specific plans.\nAnd we are going to get together after the election and do everything possible to be prepared on January 20th to start doing the business of the American people.\nReporter: Secretary Clinton, Trump today also suggested that democrats or the Clinton campaign were behind these women coming forward and making these accusations. What do you have to say to that?\nSecretary Clinton: That is just not accurate.\nReporter: We have started to hear some republicans say that it if you win, it will not be because American voters have endorsed your platform, but rather that they have rejected Trumps. How would you respond to that, and would that get in the way of an effort to bring the country back together, and have a mandate for the presidency?\nSecretary Clinton: Well clearly we are going to spend the next 17 days making the case to persuade as many Americans as possible across our country to vote for Tim and me.\nWe have close elections in America. You can go back and check that out for the last 4, 6, 8 of them. it is not unusual that the election would be close.\nSo we are not taking anything for granted. We are working our hearts out and covering as much ground.\nWe have great events planned. We have great surrogates coming out to support us that are both campaigning with us and campaigning on their own to try to convince as many people as possible to go vote.\nAs i said in pittsburgh, we are seeing some really encouraging signs about the turnout. the 200 million voter registration mark is huge, it's never been reached before. 50 million as the best estimate being young people is so encouraging.\nAnd then what we are seeing from early vote returns, I think we are over 4 million already. So I am not going to speculate about the outcome of the election, people know what Tim and I want to do. We have been very clear about that. We've laid it out in every way that we could in every different kind of forum. And I am going to be reaching out to people on the other side of the aisle, to everybody that will possibly come together with us.\nReporter: Do you see any of the outreach you have done to republicans who have rejected Donald Trump as carrying over into your potential administration? And how would fishers in the party impact some of those big items on your agenda, particularly immigration?\nSecretary Clinton: Amy, I am very encouraged by what I think we can get accomplished. I came into the senate in 2000 as you know, and I made it clear from the beginning that I wanted work with people.\nI didn't have any expectations about being treated any differently than anybody else. And I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every republican I served with.\nI think, last time we had it counted, 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or cosponsor. You don't get that done unless you work with folks on the other side.\nSo I have a record of doing that, not just in the senate, but as first lady and secretary of state. And people know that. And we will begin to get to work right away and reach out to everybody that we can possibly touch to start talking about what we can do together. And I think there is a big agenda where we can find common ground.\nReporter: Madam Secretary, have you thought at all about who you might put in your cabinet if you win?\nClinton: No I really haven't. I am a little superstitious about that. We have got a transition operation going, and I haven't really paid much attention to it yet because I want to focus on what our first task is, and that is convincing as many Americans as possible to give us the chance to serve.\nReporter: What kind of qualities are you looking for\u2014\nSecretary Clinton: I am not going to talk anymore about that.\nReporter: I was wondering, you touched on it earlier at the event, but what would your response be to trump's assertion that there is a vast media conspiracy against him supporting your campaign?\nSecretary Clinton: You know, I debated him for 4.5 hours. I am not even going to think about responding to him anymore.\nI will let the American people think about what he offers and what we offer. He can say whatever he wants and he can run his campaign however he wants to. He can go off on tangents, he can go to Gettysburg and say he's going to sue women who have made accusations against him.\nI am going to keep talking about what we want to do, what we think the country de-serves from the next president and vice president. And actually when it comes right down to it, that is what I think people end up voting on. Thank you all very much.\nReporter: Secretary Clinton, are you truly concerned that Donald trump would try to throw you in jail if he were elected? And one other issue, there was a Wikileaks email in which one of you top aids said that a Clinton Foundation conference, that's now being labeled by some of your critics as a pay to play scheme, was a mess of your own making. Would you comment on that as well?\nSecretary Clinton: No, I have nothing to say about Wikileaks, other than I think we should all be concerned about what the Russians are trying to do to our election and using Wikileaks very blatantly to try to influence the outcome of the election. I have no concerns about the first question whatsoever.\"\n","57":"\nSecretary Clinton: \"Thank you! Thank you all so much!\nWow. It is so great to be back here in Pittsburgh.\nI do not think it gets any better than to be accompanied out onto the stage by Dan and Pat Rooney.\nI am a big admirer of the Rooney family and I was so honored to serve with Dan when he was our ambassador to Ireland.\nThe Rooney family commitment to Pittsburgh is really extraordinary, and it's not just the amazing commitment to the Stealers. As special as that is, but to their roots, what they believe in, their values, and their deep concern for future generations. So I am incredibly humbled to be supported by Dan and Pat and the Rooney family. It means a great deal to both Tim and me.\nI also want to thank congressman Mike Doyle who is here with us. Allegheny and county executive Richard Fitzgerald who is here. Mayor Bill Peduto. Mayor John Federman. Pennsylvania attorney general Bruce Beemer. And all the other elected officials, it means a lot for you to be here with us. If all goes well in 17 days, we are looking forward to working with you on behalf of Pittsburgh.\nSome of you know that I have a special place in my heart for Pennsylvania, and I am excited about helping, in any way that we can, for Pittsburgh, Allegheny county, and western Pennsylvania to keep moving forward with confidence and optimism about what is possible for the future we want to create together. I am thrilled to be here with Tim Kaine.\nI asked him to be my running mate because I knew he would be one of the smartest, toughest, most qualified vice presidents we have ever had. And I also knew he had never lost an election.\nI kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit. Now that I have gotten to spend more time with him, and with his wonderful wife Anne and their family, I am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country. He is not just smart, tough and qualified, Tim Kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet.\nI am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign. Tim and I are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country, and particularly here in Pennsylvania.\nBut both of us, unlike our opponent, do not believe we can do this alone. We believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you. And that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. It may not be listed, but it will be on the ballot.\nWhether you care about new, good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down. What ever it is you care about, it is literally going to be on that ballot.\nNow, my name and Tim's name may be the ones on the ballot, but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country. And we're going to need help doing that after the election, and that is why I hope you will do everything you can to elect Katie Mcginty, your next senator.\nYou know, Katie is the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer. I think she is one of 10 children, right? One of 10 children. She has devoted her professional life to protecting working families. I have known her now for more than 20 years, when she was really young, and I have seen that same can-do spirit. She just gets up every day, and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods, to keep our kids and healthy, to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water, to help people make the most out of their own lives.\nNow she is running for the senate, because like Tim and I, she believes our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top.\nKatie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate. But more importantly, she is exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs in the senate. We have got to get things done for the people of Pennsylvania and America, and Katie will help us break through the gridlock, actually make a difference in people's lives, help us create more good jobs with rising incomes, guarantee equal pay for women, defending planned parenthood.\nAnd I think it is pretty clear when you look at Katie's opponent -- he still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump.\nA lot of republicans have. They have had the grit to stand up and say 'he does not represent me'.\nBut Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq. He heard Donald called Mexican immigrants rapists, he heard him say terrible things about women. He heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasn't really born in America -- how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear? If he doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this, then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests?\nSo, you know, when I look at this, I'm thinking to myself, we have work to do in Washington. And I know it's not easy. I understand we have some real challenges. I believe we can do it. I would not be standing here, Tim would not be with me -- but we need people in Washington who put you first, who get up every day thinking about middle-class families, who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college, how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them? How are you going to deal with all of the challenges? That is what I try to do my entire life. That is who you should be electing, people who care about you, your families, your children.\nNow, as Tim said, he asked if any of you watched the debate on Wednesday. Well, I will tell you, that was the third and last time I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.\nI mean, think about this, I have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be President and commander in chief.\nAnd after every one of those debates, people have said, how did you do that? And really, you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that. You are in front of 50, 60, 70, 80 million people. So, no matter what he would say, I just kept thinking of all the people I have met throughout this campaign. Just early today I've met Henry over there. Henry is on top of his dad's shoulders, and Henry gave me a note saying he hoped I would be president, and you know, I really want to be president for all of the kids in America to do everything I can to help you.\nYou know, I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me. From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015, people have been telling me what is on their minds, and it is one of the greatest honors.\nYou know, sometimes it is just fleeting. I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line, just running into somebody. And that person, that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop, looks into my eyes. I can tell they are trying to take my measure, and I am grateful that they take their vote, their choice so seriously. And then they might say something like, I have a really terrible problem in my family. My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin. What are you going to do about it? Or maybe they will say, my brother has schizophrenia, and we can't afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs . Or maybe they will say, I am a diabetic. And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin, and I can't afford it. What are you going to do about it?\nThat is the right question to ask anybody running for president, because at the end of the day, this is about you. As I said the other night, we are going to invest in the middle class. We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.\nAnd we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person, especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you.\nNow, I've got to say, I believe in hard work. That is how I was raised. I believe you've got to work for what you get in life. But I think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should. For me, that starts by believing in our country.\nYou know, there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many. Do we have problems? We have problems. Do we have challenges? Of course we do. We are human beings. But boy, there is no more blessed place. And Donald Trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party. He refused to say he would respect the results of this election.\nMake no mistakes about this, my friends. He is threatening our democracy. Look, I have lost elections. You don't feel very good the next day, believe me. But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?\nYou know, the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart, and whether you support me or my opponent, together we must show we support American democracy. And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us. And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote. And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now. We have just reached a milestone, more than 200 million Americans are registered to vote in this election.\nAnd you know what? That includes 50 -- more than 50 million young people. More than ever before. I find that a very hopeful sign. And here in Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012. What does this tell us? I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there, something exciting is happening right now. People are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division.\nAnd in the states where they can, people are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, and embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, everyone can contribute. You see, despite what Donald Trump may think, most Americans really believe we can do better. Most Americans really believe women should be respected.\nMost Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly. Most Americans be-lieve that the United States should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe.\nThe energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election. It is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children. And it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters. I want you to know, if Tim and I are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president, we will work with everyone.\nNow I imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west, you probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump. And here is what I want you to tell them. I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too.\nBecause whether you agree or disagree with me, whether you vote for me or vote against me, I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I have seen that. I know it can happen. And I know there are a lot of people here in Pennsylvania who have a lot of questions. They want to know, how do we move forward better. They want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more. They are upset what they see around them. I get that. But anger is not a plan.\nAnd we need -- we need to work together. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania. I think that is what our whole country needs right now. That's what I will try to do. I am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems. That does not happen in the real world. But I know we can make progress together. The choice we face in this election is stark, especially when it comes to the economy.\nTim and I believe when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And when we invest in working families, in the middle class, in small businesses, we can make the economy work again for everybody. I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective. They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, corporations, it will all trickle down to everybody else. It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up, and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right. Married to one, that's right. Worked for one.\nAnd here is what I know. That when you focus on helping the middle class, you end up lifting everybody. When you focus on helping the top, you help the top. That is not good enough. Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers, but his actions tell a different story. Yes, he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects. He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs.\nI would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work, instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania. And for all his talk about putting America first, he has made many of his products in 12 different countries. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America? And we now know -- we now know he hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes for years. He says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place. Especially -- answer me this -- how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business?\nNever could figure that out. But what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has. That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks.\nI will tell you what. It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways, zero for everything. And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America. Well it's unfair and it's wrong. With your help, we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our water systems all need help, and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done, jobs that can't be exported out of Pennsylvania.\nI believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States. That is why we will invest $10 billion in a make it in America partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses, universities, and community colleges.\nSome countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries. Some countries is going to take the lead with 3-d printing. We invented both of those technologies. We should take the lead and we should have the jobs.\nWe are also going to fight climate change with clean, renewable energy jobs. And we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in America. And we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits. Don't let anybody fool you, my friends. assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class.\nIt is time to say loudly and clearly, right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America.\nSo, I have set some big goals. I am excited about what we are going to do. And it's all going to put people to work right here. And sometimes folks say to me, how are you going to get that done? You go to the congress \u2014well first of all, I hope we will elect some or democrats. That will be job number one. Number two, I think it will be a very simple question. Our members of congress, members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy, or on your side? And you know what? They are going to have to answer that question. Because if they stay beholden to the special interest, if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the senate. I have seen it. I know it. If they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in America, then I want to make sure that they don't come back to Washington after the next election.\nWe are in a great, great high school here, and I am so proud to be here.\nAnd so, we are going to be a good partner with education, especially with educators. We are going to start with universal pre-k. We want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a world-class education.\nAnd I want us to bring technical education back to high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out.\nThere are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in today's economy -- coming out of high school, maybe going to community college, going into an apprenticeship program, and I want to lift up that work. A four-year college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life.\nWe are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And we are going to help you pay down your college debt.\nIt's going to be great. To help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job, so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford. I worked on this with Senator Bernie Sanders, and it's going to help save -- it's going to help save people thousands of dollars.\nIn fact after a year, maybe after you are here -- you can go to hillaryclin-ton.com\/calculator to see how much your family can save. We want you to know we are going to deliver results for you.\nI mean, ultimately it's pretty simple. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody and I want everybody to have your chance to get your piece of the American dream.\nSo, there's a lot of work we are going to be doing. We need to raise the national mini-mum wage. People who work full-time should not be mired in poverty. We are, as Tim said, going to guarantee equal pay for women. You know, look, it's not just a woman's issue. If you have a mother, which all of us do -- if you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, or a sister who's working, it's your issue. It's good for the entire family, it's good for our economy.\nSo my friends, there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days. Because we have got to get the word out. We have got to tell everybody what we are doing and why this election is so critically important. And that's where all of you come in. If you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent.\nAudience Member: Nope!\nSecretary Clinton: Well, you may. You know, I hope you will stage an intervention.\nAnd I do hope you will talk about, you know, the reality versus the demagoguery of what we have seen in this campaign.\nYou know, we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as I said in the beginning, whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. I care a lot about making sure that women and girls are treated with dignity and respect that they deserve in our country.\nI care a lot about making sure that we save social security and we ensure that everybody has the benefits that they need in order to be able to live a decent life in retirement.\nAnd, boy, do I care a lot about our constitution.\nAnd maybe it's because on your behalf I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state. And I met a lot of people who in the us because we have been so steady and so committed to our constitutional system and our values. And what I hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did, as our parents and grandparents did, because maybe they came from somewhere else where they weren't treated right. Maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law.\nYou know, every time Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent, meaning me, I think to myself, you know, we don't do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary.\nOr, you know, when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on.\nYou know, I get criticized by the press. I know that is part of our democratic system. We believe in a free press. And boy, if you go to countries where there isn't one, you will understand why that is so important.\nAnd when he says there should be a religious test -- a religious test for people at our borders, a country founded on religious freedom. You have to ask yourself, who is going to conduct the test? Are we going to get a quiz? What if the border security official does not believe you? Who gets to decide whether you get to come in or out based on your religion?\nAnd if you haven't seen it yet, I hope you will go and look at the extraordinary statement by Mr. Khan on Youtube in a new video that we have put out. You remember, he pulled out a constitution at our convention. And he reveres our constitution. And for good reason. Because he, too, came from a place where the was no rule of law to speak of.\nSo, whatever issue you care about, this is an issue that will be decided by this election, and that is why I'm reaching out to republicans, democrats, independents, everyone. I know if we bring our talent, our energy, and our ambition to the work of building our country, we are going to see the best days of America ahead of us, and when your chil-dren and your grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I hope you will say you voted for a better America.\nSo, here we go. Just remember -- you've got to get out and vote, you've got to get everybody you know to get out and vote. If you do not know where to vote, please go to iwillvote.com. You can put your information in and, it is the magic of the internet. They will tell you where you are supposed to vote. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. Or you can take your phone out right and text join to 47246. And if we can get all of you and everybody you know involved in this next 17 days, I will tell you this -- it is easy to forget how far our country has come.\nThere are a lot of people here -- as I said, whose parents and grandparents came here as immigrants. My grandfather, Hugh Rodam, came as an immigrant, as a young boy and settled in Scranton. And he went to work in the Scranton lace mills, he went to work in his teens, he worked there until he retired at the age of 65. He believed in our country. He believed in the kind of future he could get through his hard work. That is what I want everybody in our country to believe again. We are going to unleash the talent, the innovation, the energy that brought people like my grandfather here, but which we will harness for the future. Don't let anybody tell you America's best days are behind us. Don't believe that for a minute.\nWe are going to pull together. We are going to make it clear that confidence and opti-mism, respect for each other, bringing folks together who may disagree but can begin to find common ground is what has always worked and it will work again. Help us. Help us create that kind of future, and help us prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you all.\"\n","58":"\nThank you. [applause]\nThank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you please sit down. Thank you.\nIt's my privilege to be here in Gettysburg hallowed ground where so many lives were given in service to freedom. Amazing place.\nPresident Lincoln served at a time of division like we've never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now. We are a very divided nation.\nI'm not a politician and have never wanted to be a politician, believe me. But, when I saw the trouble our country was in I knew I couldn't stand by and watch any longer.\nOur country has been so good to me. I love our country and I felt I had to act. [applause]\nI've seen the system up-close-and-personal for many years. I've been a major part of it.\nI know how the game works in Washington and on Wall Street and I know how they've rigged the rules of the game against everyday Americans. The rules are rigged.\nNearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't even working. One in five households have no one with a job. 45 million Americans are on food stamps and 47 million are living in poverty.\nWe have failed our inner cities and in so doing have failed our African-American and Hispanic communities.\nWe've misguided military adventures overseas and wars that go on forever that just cannot be won by the people that are doing it now. They don't know how to win the wars at home.\nWe have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical care.\nChange has to come from outside our very broken system. Our system is broken.\nThe fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once-in-a-lifetime. [applause]\nThe system is totally rigged and broken. First, the issue of voter fraud. According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly significantly inaccurate. And when I say that there are such inaccuracies, it's unbelievable.\n1.8 million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting. I wonder how that happens.\n2.8 million people are registered in more than one state is a number folks. These are numbers.\nFourteen percent of non-citizens are registered to vote. The system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States. But, the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes which included lying to the FBI and congress on numerous occasions and included saying I do not recall to the FBI on 39 separate times.\nShe recalls everything else, but 39 separate times she said I do not recall. Well, that's a lies. Also, then there is the deletion of at least 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress that's after receiving the subpoena as an example.\nIt was announced this week that the highly-respected four-star general James Cartwright, maybe sentenced to up to five years in prison with a massive fine for lying on one occasion to the FBI. He said he did that for national security reasons.\nHighly respected man. A four-star general. This took place two days ago. How must he feel. A big part of the rigging of this election is the fact that Hillary is being allowed to run despite having broken so many laws on so many different occasions.\nWhy is she allowed to run? The dishonest, mainstream media is also part in a major part of this corruption. They're corrupt. They lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice, look as bad and even dangerous as possible.\nAt my rallies, they never show or talk about the massive crowd size and try to diminish all of our events.\nOn the other hand, they don't show the small size of Hillary's crowds but in fact talk about how many people are there. Very small crowds. You know it. They know it.\nOver the last two days, three highly respected national polls said we're in first place and one of those pollsters was the most accurate pole on the last two cycles. But, the media refuses to even say it or put that word out. They refused to talk about it.\nThey're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people as an example of the power structure and fighting. AT&T is buying Time Warner and the CNN. A deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\nLikewise, Amazon, which through its ownership controls the Washington Post, should be paying massive taxes. It's not paying and it's a very unfair playing field and you see what that's happening and what that's doing to department stores all over the country.\nVery very unfair and you're talking about billions and billions of dollars. They should be paying those taxes.\nAdditionally, Comcast purchase of NBC concentrates far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do. Deals like this destroy democracy and we'll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that.\nThis should never ever have been approved in the first place. They're trying to poison the mind of the American voter. Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total Fabrication. The events never happened, never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over but a simple phone called placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks get them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever.\nHere is why this is relevant to you. If they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they can do to you. Your jobs. Your security. Your education. Your healthcare. The violation of religious liberty. The theft of your second amendment. The loss of your factories, your homes, and much more.\nLook at what they've done to you with your jobs. It is just been lined on video, that the violent protests at some of my rallies, like in Chicago, where police and others were seriously hurt. You saw that blood pouring down their face were caused by paid, paid DNC and Clinton campaign operatives.\nNow, we didn't know this. We didn't know, this just came out two days ago on tape. We didn't know this. We were amazed at the level of violence. These were paid operatives. Paid by the DNC and probably the Clinton campaign.\nThis is a criminal act. Policemen were badly hurt and so were many others and these people prosecuted. But because of the rigged system they probably won't be. Just like we found out about these paid violent protesters, it was probably the DNC and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories. But, we'll find out their involvement at a later date through litigation and I look so forward to doing.\nThe rigging of the system is designed for one reason, to keep the corrupt establishment and special interests in power at your expense and everybody's expense.\nI have no special interest but you the American Vogel. [applause]\nI didn't have to do this, believe me. There's nothing easy about it but I had to do it.\nI love our country.\nI love the people of our country and I felt I had to do it. [applause]\nThank you. One thing we all know is that we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.\nHillary Clinton is not running against me, she's running against change and she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters. [applause]\nWe now find ourselves at that very special fork in the road, do we repeat the mistakes of the past or do we choose to believe that a great future yet unwritten still lies ahead for us and for our wonderful beloved country. [applause]\nI think it does.\nI know it does.\nMy economic plan will deliver at least 25 million jobs in one decade. Now, our jobs have been taken away. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to so many other countries. It's a one lane highway where they get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the money, and we get the drugs and we get the unemployment and it's going to change.\nBelieve me it's going to change. [applause]\nAnd that goes for all countries. When you look at China, when you look at every trade deal we have, is horrible and we should be ashamed of a people and the people that let those deals happen.\nThey're defective and they knew they were defective and they were done for a reason. And believe me they will be unwound so fast and we will have trade. We will have great trade and it'll be free trade but it'll be fair trade and it'll be real.\nMy security plan, so important.\nThey've taken the jobs from us.\nMy security plan will bring safety to our poorest communities.\nMy ethics plan will end corruption in our government. [applause] We will. Corruption is massive.\nWe will drain the swamp in Washington DC and replace it with a new government of, by, and for the people. [applause]\nThat is why I have chosen Gettysburg to unveil this contract. I'm asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character and there's nothing better or stronger than the American character. [applause]\nI am asking the American people to dream big once again.\nWhat follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It's a contract between Donald J Trump and the American voter \u2013 and begins with bringing honesty, accountability and change to Washington DC.\nTherefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:\nFIRST, a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. [applause]\nSECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition exempting military, public safety, and public health. [applause]\nTHIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. Regulations are killing our country and our jobs. [applause]\nFOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service, making a fortune. [applause]\nFIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, very bad.[applause]\nSIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, that's what's happening. [applause]\nOn the same day, I will begin taking and really taking strongly 7 actions to protect American workers. Our American workers have been treated so badly by politicians that don't have their interest at heart and we are going to change that. We're going to change that very very fast.\nFIRST, I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by Bill Clinton or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. [applause]\nSECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a potential disaster for our country. [applause]\nTHIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. China is a currency manipulator. What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad and I don't blame them. They have been very smart. I blame our politicians for letting this take place. So easy to stop so easy to stand.\nFOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. [applause]\nFIFTH, very importantly I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job producing American energy reserves, [applause] including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal and we will put our miners back to work.\nSIXTH, I will lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks that allow for this vital energy infrastructure projects to forward. We have roadblocks like you've never ever seen. Environmental blocks, structural blocks, we're going to allow the Keystone Pipeline and so many other things to move forward. Tremendous numbers of jobs and good for our country.\nSEVENTH, we are going to cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs [applause] and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure. We're paying billions and billions and billions of dollars. We're going to fix our own environment. [applause].\nAdditionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law. We have to do that.\nFIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\nSECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia whose wife by the way has a Trump sign. His wife is a phenomenal woman. Has a Trump sign in her front yard, isn't that nice? I just found that out this morning. From one of the 20 judges on my list, you know we're going to make great decisions from twenty outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nTHIRD, we will cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities. [applause]\nFOURTH, we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country these are drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers, and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back [applause] and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and they had someone who was bad, really bad and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldn't take him. She said we'll bring him back; we don't want to force the country to take him. There won't be one such instance if I become president. [applause]\nFIFTH, We're going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. [applause] And if you look at Syria and the migration, we're taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country. We have no idea who they are, what their thought process is, where they come from and Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring by 550%. Radical, Islamic terror is right around the corner. We have to be so tough, so smart, so vigilant. We can't allow that to happen [applause] we have enough problems. [applause] All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. We will be very careful.\nNext, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:\n1. Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. [applause] We need that so badly. We need jobs. Our jobs have left us. Our good jobs have really left us.\nThe largest tax reductions are for the middle class. [applause] Who have been forgotten. Called the forgotten man and woman. They have been forgotten. A middle-class family with 2 children will get basically a 35% tax cut. And that's what they can use and that money will go back into the economy. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. [applause]\nThe business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. It's stuck. We can't bring it back. Two and a half to five trillion dollars. Companies can't get it back into the country. Some companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because the can't get their money and they are actually leaving to get their money. We are going to simplify that. We're going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country. [applause]\n2. The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. [applause]\nThey leave the United Stated like carrier like forward like so many others. They leave the United States and fire all of their employees. They go to Mexico or another country. They build a beautiful brand new plant. They hire other people. They then take their air conditioners, their cars, whatever they're making. They send it tax free across what will be a very strong border believe me [applause] but they send it tax free across the border and what do we end with we have?\nWe have unemployment, tremendous losses, and we have none of the benefits. So we will establish tariffs that when they do that there will be consequences. We will work with them; we will be nice we will be fair but there has to be consequences. And when they know their consequences our companies will stop leaving the United States and going to other countries.\n3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. Our infrastructure is in such trouble. We've doubled our national debt to 20 trillion dollars under president Obama. In less than 8 years, 10 trillion dollars has been added. Think of it and we haven't fixed anything. We haven't fixed anything. What have we doe? Our roads are broken, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools, and we have 20 trillion in debt. All-time high. That's true, our VA hospitals are in bad shape. VA is in very very bad shape and we will fix that. We are going to work on fixing that [applause] because our veterans are not treated properly. We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans [applause] and we're not going to have that. It is revenue neutral.\n4. School Choice and Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. [applause] And so importantly ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities.\nWe do so badly on education. If you look at the lists, you see Sweden, Norway, Denmark, different countries at the top. You see us at the bottom and yet by far, per-pupil, more money than anybody and it's not even close. We spend more money per-pupil than anybody not even close. We're at the bottom of the list. Other countries spending far less per-pupil are at the top of the list so obviously our current system is not working. We will change it and we will make it good. [applause] It expands vocational and technical education, which we've totally forgotten about in this country and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.\nHave you ever gone to school and you've been with people that aren't good students but they can fix an engine or they can build a wall or they can do things that you wouldn't even think about because we can use some of the one who build the wall [laughter] we're going to need them [laughter] we're going to need them but did you ever see that how they are genius at fixing a car? They can do anything, but history, not so good, physics, not so good, we have to open vocational again. [applause]\nThose are people those are great people.\n5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. [applause] Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with Health Savings Accounts, so we can do that. The Health Savings Account, it's one way there are numerous ways but this one very good way. The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines. We have to do it because that's competition. The politicians won't let go of it because the insurance companies, they don't want competition but we'll open it up. Believe me we will get rid of it I've been saying it for years. And lets states manage Medicaid funds it will be so good. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Mean they are looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients that it's over, these people are dying, they want to get the drug. They won't be living much longer and we study it for years and years and at some point they have to do what they have to do. They have to do it properly but we have 4,000 different drugs and products waiting in ling for approval and we can't get them approved. We are going to speed up that process very significantly\n6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and you see that with a couple of companies and it is such a great thing to see and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. [applause] so good\n7. End Illegal Immigration Act. [applause]\nFully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border, don't worry about it. Remember I said Mexico's paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall. Ok. We are going to have the wall; Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Mexico's by the way I met with the President of Mexico 2 \u00bd months ago, wonderful meeting, wonderful person. But I told him this is a two-way highway not a one-way highway.\nWe have our people. We have out take care of our people. Have to protect our people so it's got to be a two-way street otherwise it is going to be a whole different deal. But establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence, there are people coming in illegally, for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; so when somebody comes in, we send them out. They come back, they go to prison for quite a while. They come back, they come back again they go five years. Because what is happening is they are coming back ten times and I could go cases after case they come back.Look at what happened in San Francisco five times he came back on the fifth time he killed. Five times. But so many others 110 times came back, killed somebody after ten times. When they get deported they stay out otherwise they have very serious prison terms. They will stay out. Once you do that, they will stay out. Right now, they have no consequence. They have no consequence.\nAlso reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. [applause]\n8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police who are doing such a great job, believe me. We increase the resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars [applause] or out of our country and into the country where they came from. [applause]\n9. Restoring National Security Act. Which rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester which has been very tough on military and expanding military investment.\nNow, at no time, practically, do we need a military like right now. We don't want to use it, but it is peace through strength. We need a strong military. [applause]\nOur military is so terribly depleted. It also provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice. If they're waiting on line and I have the plan up and we've gotten as you know tremendous support from veterans, from law enforcement, from veterans, from the military tremendous support. But if they're waiting in line and you see it 22 suicides a day, people don't even believe it, but 22 suicides a day. But if they're waiting in line 47 days, 6 days, 9 days, they can't get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die, they die waiting in line. We're going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor, a private doctor, a public hospital, or private hospital, all looking to help and all looking to do business. And we will pay the bill. So much cheaper but much more importantly the veterans will finally be taken care of properly because what they are going through now is unacceptable. [applause]\nAlso, we are going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing, cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values [applause] we want people that love our country or can love our country and people that will love our citizens. [applause]\nWe want people that can love us and there are ways through talent of determining that and other countries do but we don't. Just come on in folks. Just come on in.\n10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts tough new ethics reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests and donors on our politics.\nOn November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. [applause]\nAnd importantly we will Make America Great Again.\nBelieve me.\n","59":"\n\"Hello Cleveland. Wow. There is nothing like being introduced by Congresswoman Marcia Fudge to get everybody going.\nI am so excited to be here, what a time to be back in Cleveland.\nThe Indians are going to the World Series.\nThat is after the Cavs won the championship. What a year for Cleveland, you really are \"Believe Land.\"\nNow I, for one, am hoping for a Great Lakes series, I spent a lot of days at Wrigley field as a kid, so that would be a dream come true for me, to have Cleveland and Chicago in World Series, and for us to win Ohio.\nI want to thank all of the people who are here today because you've heard from some great, great folks. I want to thank Governor Ted Strickland, our candidate to the United States Senate. I'll tell you, we could really use a Democratic senate to get things done for the people of Ohio and America.\nI wanna thank Mayor Frank Jackson, County Executive, Armond Budish. I wanna thank my great friend from Youngstown, Congressman Tim Ryan.\nAnd we need you all in. We need you all in. You're rallying together and we need to rally together because you know, I really believe we are stronger together!\nAnybody watch the debate Wednesday night? Well, that was the third and last time. That I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.\nI have now spent four and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again, I have the stamina to be president and commander in chief.\nReally, you -- you just have to be a good cheer when you find yourself in situations like that.\nAnd because I love this country and I believe in the American people, I could feel so clear in my own mind and my heart about what we can do together. So no matter what he was saying, I just kept thinking of all the people that I have met throughout this campaign. And I had the chance to talk about some of the most important concerns on people's minds, what keeps you up at night. And as I said then and as I have said continuously, we're going to invest in the middle class.\nWe're going to invest in you and your families. We're going to make sure we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes that every single person, especially every single young American here today, will have the chance to go as far as your talents and your hard work will take you.\nAnd we're also going to protect our children from gun violence. We are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33,000 people a year. We can come together to meet our challenges, no matter what they are.\nBut on Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done. He refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.\nNow, make no mistake. By doing that, he is threatening our democracy.\nHe is basically saying hey, we've been around 240 years and we've always had peaceful transitions no matter who won or who lost. Look, if you lose an election -- I've lost elections, you don't feel very good the next day, do you?\nBut we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?\nAnd the peaceful transition -- the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart. It's how we hold our country together no matter who's in charge. You know, I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and I -- I saw the difference between what we do and what others do, I was in countries where people jail their political opponents or execute them or exile them. Or invalidate elections that they didn't win.\nThat can never be allowed to happen here. I believe that's true no matter who you support in this election, whether or not you support me. Or you support my opponent, together, we must support American democracy and the country that has given every one of us so many opportunities.\nAnd the best way to do that, my friends, is to turn out and vote.\n[points to an audience member holding a sign]\nThose are great. That is great. I'm excited because we are well on our way, there is an inspiring story being written right now by people across America, and many of you are getting involved in this election, some of you for the first time in your lives. We now have in America more than 200 million registered voters.\nThat is more than we have ever had in our entire history, and that is really good news for our democracy. More than 50 million millennials have registered.\nYou know what that means? Young people will determine the outcome of this election, which I think is good news. That means our future is in good hands.\nAnd listen to this, because this is really exciting. More than 4 million people have already voted.\nIncluding many people right here in Ohio.\nIn fact, in the first four days of in-person early voting here in Ohio, more people showed up to vote than they did at the same time in 2012, in our last election.\nThat is fantastic and it shows how serious people are taking this election. So numbers like that remind us that no matter all the negativity that's out there, there is something really exciting happening right now. People are coming together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, all of us to reject hate and division.\nPeople are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, to embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, and everyone can contribute. That is my vision. I have a hopeful, optimistic, unifying vision for what our country will be. Because from the beginning, our campaign has been focused on ideas, not insults, on bringing people together, not tearing us apart.\nAnd I want all of you to know that that is true not only for the campaign, but if I am fortunate enough to be your president, I want you to know, and I want you to tell anybody you know, any friends, or colleagues at school or work, or your neighborhood who may be planning to support the other guy, here is what I want you to tell them.\nI want you to tell them that I want to be their president. I want to be every single American's president, whether you agree or disagree, whether you vote for me or against me.\nI believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I believe that. And I have seen that happen. I want to be a good listener. I know there are a lot of people here in Ohio who are discouraged, frustrated, even angry about what is going on in their lives, about losing jobs, they are upset about what they see happening around them. I get that.\nBut I think anger is not a plan. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have here in Ohio. I think that is what the country needs now. And that is what I will try to offer.\nCLINTON: I am not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems. That would not be fair. It wouldn't be true. But I know we can make progress together and you deserve something to vote for, not just against.\nSo I want to speak directly to the challenges that a lot of people here in Ohio face, especially when it comes to our economy. You see I believe really simply that when the middle class thrives, America thrives. When we build the economy from the middle out and the ground up, not from the top down, we are more likely to provide better lives, better incomes, better opportunities for more Americans.\nMy opponent has a different perspective. He really believes if you give trillions, that's with a T, trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, everything will work out. It's really trickle down on steroids. I believe differently that we must invest in working families in the middle class, in small businesses, that will power the economy.\nAnd that's what we're going to do. We're going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top who have done pretty well over the last years. Now Donald likes to say he's on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story. He has been buying cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects when he should be buying good American made steel that supports good American jobs.\nAnd this is a very important issue here in Ohio because you're one of the largest steel producing states in America so you understand how important this is to support the American steel industry so I'm going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steel workers filing for unemployment. He has put Chinese steel workers to work, not American steel workers and we're going to change that.\nAnd for all of his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits were made in Mexico. They could have been made in Brooklyn, Ohio. Trump's furniture is made in Turkey and it could have been made in Cleveland. Trump barware is made in Slovenia instead of Toledo. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America again?\nAnd we also know that he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years.\nHe says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose $1 billion in a year in the first place. But what that means is everybody else here, all of us, have paid more in federal income taxes than a billionaire, right? And that means he's contributed zero, zero for our military or our vets, zero for Pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways or investing in clean energy or other ways to help us with new jobs for the future.\nNow Tim Kaine and I, we have a different view. We want to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy, technology and small business. We are going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\nAnd I've set some big goals. I want us to deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term.\nAnd enough clean energy to power every home within 10 years.\nWe're also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-kindergarten education.\nAnd we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education. I want us to bring back technical education in high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools.\nAnd let's remember, it's at community colleges like this that thousands and thousands of people in our country, of all ages, get such a good start.\nAnd I'm going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.\nEducation should lift you up, not hold you back. And we're going to help you, we're going to help you pay back and pay down your loans. Too many young people are burdened by those debts.\nIt's going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income, so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford. Senator Bernie Sanders and I worked on this plan together.\nIt's going to help save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can actually go to HillaryClinton.com\/calculator to see how much money you and your family could save with our plan.\nI also want to do more for apprenticeship programs. I thank all the unions represented here for the great apprentice programs that you have in place. Thank you.\nI want to support apprenticeship programs and skills trainings with business and labor unions, because there are going to be good jobs out there for welders, and machinists, and health technicians, and computer coders, and so much more. I want everybody to have the chance to get your piece of the American dream, and I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.\nAnd we're going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty.\nAs I said in the debate the other night, I want to make sure that we take care of people on Social Security who were low-income workers and women, particularly widows, who lose have of their monthly payment when their husbands die.\nWe've got to do more to make sure Social Security provides a decent income for our seniors. And, yes, don't you think it's finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\nNow the equal pay issue is important in and of itself because, if you've got a mother or a wife or a daughter or a sister who's working, you want her to be paid fairly. I mean that's good for the entire family, right?\nBut the equal pay issue gets at something even deeper. We've got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that they deserve.\nWe cannot -- we cannot tolerate the kind of behavior and language we've seen from my opponent. He thinks that belittling women makes him bigger. Goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know how that feels.\nSo we're going to stand up for everybody, men and women, retirees, the young, millennials, everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.\nAnd I have said repeatedly that we're going to reform the criminal justice system so that it works fairly for everyone. And we have to address systemic racism that is still too big a part of our lives together.\nI want to give credit to all the young people, and really people of all ages, who've been marching and speaking out, doing everything you can to make sure that issues of policing and mass incarceration, environmental justice, economic justice, educational equity, gun violence, voting rights, that they get the attention they deserve. Because it's important that we lift these issues up and work to make sure that everybody in our country feels like they are seen and they are heard. And all the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful ways really deserve our appreciation.\nI'm going to do everything I can to lift these issues up, because one of my hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and discrimination in whatever form it takes.\nSo really, when you think about it, my name will be on the ballot, but it is not just me. People say, well, she has lots of plans and all of that. I do, but I also have a lot of humility about this.\nI really believe our country is at a turning point, that this is a crossroads election. So yes, my name may be on the ballot, but the question really is, who are we as a country? What are our values? What kind of future do we want to create together?\nIt is so easy to get cynical about politics, believe me, I know that. But this matters so deeply to our families and our communities and our country, and indeed our world.\nSo I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support for my opponent. I know you may still have questions for me. I respect that, I want to answer them, I want to earn your vote.\nI am reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents. I think America needs every single one of us to bring our energy and our talents, our ambition to build that better country.\nSo I hope that as we move through these next 18 days, everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see, not just in your next president, but in your lives, in your jobs, in your education, in our future together.\nAnd the only way we can have that positive, optimistic, unifying future is if all of you help us get there. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on, every voter you register makes a big difference.\nSo I hope you will give whatever time you can for these last days. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. You can text \"JOIN,\" J-O-I-N, to 47246 to join. With your help, we can elect Democrats up and down the ballot starting with Ted Strickland and others who are running.\nRemember that early in-person voting in Ohio began on October 12th and it ends on November 7th. So you have more of a window to vote than a lot of people in other states.\nAnd I hope you will exercise that. And I hope that you will decide whatever issue you care about, you can almost in your mind's eye see that on the ballot, see it next to my name, see it whether you care about climate change and what we are doing to protect the Great Lakes, including Lake Eerie, while creating good paying clean energy jobs.\nWhether you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions.\nIf you believe marriage equality should be protected.\nAnd that LGBT Americans should be treated equally.\nIf you believe we should do more to stop the opioid epidemic that is destroying lives and communities.\nThat we should do more to help with mental health and make sure that people get the treatment that they deserve.\nIf you believe we need to get the cost of health care, premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and prescription drug costs down.\nIf you believe that we should have a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity.\nThis is our chance to send a very clear, unmistakable message about what kind of country and future we want.\nYou know, I have two of the most wonderful grandchildren ever, and I see them whenever I can, I FaceTime with them all the time.\nBut I think about them endlessly because I feel such a sense of responsibility, not just because they're my grandchildren, obviously, and I would do anything to help them, but because I want everybody's children and grandchildren to have the same opportunities, to chart your own future, to believe in yourself, to contribute to this great America democracy of ours.\nTo be part on an economy that lifts you up, not drags you down. I am motivated by my work that I've done my entire life on behalf of kids and families.\nFrom the time I joined the Children's Defense Fund, until today. And I will do whatever I can to make it my mission to give every single person, especially every child and young person, the chance to live up to your God-given potential.\nLet's go out and prove that love trumps hate. Thank you!\"\n","60":"\nThank you.\nIn 18 days, we are going to win the state of North Carolina and we are going to win the White House.\nOur opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns -- raised from special interests -- and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure to send in your ballot.\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving North Carolina under a Trump Administration.\nWe will be a strong nation again. American Leadership has grown so weak, that the Philippines have broken with decades of pro-American foreign policy to instead leave for the orbit of China and Russia.\nStrength will also require growth.\nRight now, our economy isn't growing at all. We had only around 1% growth in the last quarter. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.\nMany workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.\nCompanies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico.\nFord is moving all of its small car production to Mexico.\nWhen I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.\nHillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries \u2013 including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's how our system is corrupt and broken.\nWe're going to take on big donors, big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense.\nThe media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile \u2013 who is now under tremendous pressure to resign.\nHillary was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate.\nYears ago there was a show called the $64,000 question \u2013 a contestant got the questions in advance, his life was ruined.\nThis is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.\nNow, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco for an appearance \u2013 more pay-for-play.\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\nIt's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.\nThose reforms include the following:\nA 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service.\nA lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\nA complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.\nAdditionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\nNot only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs\nAt the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nNorth Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nWe've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nA Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.\nWe are going to start making things in America again \u2013 and we are going to start making things in North Carolina again.\nIn order to bring manufacturing back to North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and so many other places, we are going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy.\nAmerican trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.\nIn my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated into one Office. It will report to what we call the American Desk. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.\nIt's going to be America First.\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe are also going to rebuild our inner cities.\nAfrican- Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.\nThe violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.\nThere is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.\nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse.\nTo the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?\nVote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nNational Security begins at the border.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East \u2013 meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can.\nIf I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\nIt was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, his victims included one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.\nA 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported \u2013 but never was.\nWhat kind of government allows its citizens to suffer such horrors?\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\nA victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 18 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOur campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens.\nIt's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.\nI'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like North Carolina and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people \u2013 not the donors and special interests.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.\nYou're going to remember this day.\nThis is a movement like you've never seen before.\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most\nimportant vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nBecause if we win \u2013\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n","61":"\nThank you.\nIn 18 days, we are going to win the state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win the White House.\nBut you have to vote on November 8th.\nOur opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns \u2013 raised from special interests \u2013 and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, end Common Core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump Administration.\nWe are also going to rebuild our badly depleted military.\nOur Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I. My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need. This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort. The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example. I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort.\nAs our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more.\nWe will establish 'centers of excellence' in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet.\nWe will rebuild our navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania.\nAs part of our plan for bold change to make your life better, we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure.\nObama-Clinton doubled the national debt in 8 years \u2013 but instead of rebuilding America, the money was all lost and America's infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\nWe're also spending $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East, with nothing to show for it.\nImagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia.\nInstead, we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our own to crumble. We defend other countries' borders, invest in their resources, but abandon our own. The plan I am proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix America's transportation, drinking water, and other vital infrastructure. This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships, proven financing programs, and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job-and-wealth producing investments in the local economy.\nThis means help for projects like the Pennsylvania Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian Highway System. My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade or replace bridges in the Commonwealth that have been deemed \"structurally deficient.\"\nWe are also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania \u2013 shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\nWe are putting Pennsylvania back to work, and we are putting the special interests out of work.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stop the TPP, and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation.\nYour city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA \u2013 a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.\n70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization.\nJust a few miles from here, there's a very famous bridge that says: \"Trenton Makes, The World Takes.\"\nUnder a Trump Administration, I can promise you: we are going to start making things in America again \u2013 and we are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again.\nYour products will be sent around the world, not your jobs.\nHillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries.\nShe's the most corrupt person ever to run for President.\nShe bleached and deleted 33,000 emails \u2013 after a Congressional subpoena \u2013 lied under oath to Congress, lied to the FBI, obstructed justice, made 13 phones disappear \u2013 some with a hammer \u2013 and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence have mysteriously gone missing.\nNow, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco for an appearance \u2013 more pay-for-play.\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\nIt's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.\nOne new proposal I am outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business.\nI will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated.\nWe're losing $2 trillion dollars in economic activity a year to regulations \u2013 the only people getting rich are the lobbyists, lawyers and special interests.\nI am also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\nNot only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.\nMy plan lowers our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe are also going to rebuild our inner cities.\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.\nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse.\nTo the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?\nVote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nWe will take care of our inner cities, and we will bring safety, prosperity and security to the people of Philadelphia.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nNational security begins at the border.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East \u2013 meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nShe even wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nIt was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl.

He left her on the side of a dirt road.\nA 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported \u2013 but never was.\nIf I'm elected, we will impose tough new mandatory minimum federal prison sentences for anyone who illegally re-enters the country after previously being deported. And we will swiftly remove and deport all criminal aliens from this country, and dismantle the gangs and cartels preying on our citizens.\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\nA victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nFor the next 18 days, you have to get every last person you know out to the voting booths.\nThis is our one magnificent chance to reclaim our country for We The People.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.\nI'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Pennsylvania and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people \u2013 not the donors and special interests.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day.\nThis is a movement like you've never seen before.\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nIf we win, the change you've been waiting for will finally arrive.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n","62":"\nThank you.\nIn 19 days, we are going to win the state of Ohio and we are going to win the White House.\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote in-person.\nLadies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic Presidential election \u2013 if I win!\nALTERNATE:\nLadies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept \u2013 without delay or hesitation \u2013 the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nNow, seriously, the debate last night was amazing and everybody said I won, including every single online poll, some by 90-10.\nThe question of voter fraud came up during the debate. We want fairness in the election, having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the country.\nJohn Podesta, Hillary's Campaign Chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks, as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have Drivers' Licenses.\nOne of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton Campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence. This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful, Democratic elections.\nA campaign like Clinton's that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything.\nAnd a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who will lie to the Congress and the FBI, destroy 33,000 emails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies \u2013 is a candidate who is truly capable of anything.\nIn addition, it was just learned, Hillary was given the exact debate questions, word for word, by Donna Brazile \u2013 who is now under tremendous pressure to resign. But I ask you, why shouldn't Hillary Clinton resign from the race \u2013 she was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate?\nYears ago there was a show called the $64,000 question \u2013 he got the questions in advance, his life was ruined. This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.\nSo it's in that context I was asked a question about whether I would agree, in advance, to concede the results on election night. This is an unprecedented question. If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Bush V. Gore.\nIn effect, I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of voters.\nAccording to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.\n1.8 million dead people are registered to vote (some of whom vote even though they are dead \u2013 which is a hard thing to do, but easy if fraud is involved).\n2.8 million people are registered in more than one state.\nAnd 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote.\nSo what I'm saying is, we have to be vigilant and we have to be careful.\nAmerica is a Constitutional Republic with a system of laws. These laws are triggered in the case of fraud, or in the event a recount is needed.\nOf course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before me.\nBut, none of this will matter, since we are going to win big on November 8th.\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Ohio under a Trump Administration.\nRight now, our economy isn't growing at all. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.\nMany workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.\nCompanies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico. When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back in. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.\nRight now, our politicians don't do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests \u2013 Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries.\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\nIt's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.\nThose reforms include the following:\nA 5 year-ban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.\nA lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\nA ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.\nAdditionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\nIt's about time.\nNot only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nAt the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nOhio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization \u2013 two Bill and Hillary-backed disasters.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nA Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.\nI also have another major announcement I am going to make today that concerns manufacturing in the United States, and how we are going to bring jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and all across this great nation.\nAmerican trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.\nIn my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated in one Office. It will report to an American Desk and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.\nIt's going to be America First.\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe are also going to rebuild our inner cities.\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.\nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nAnd it's getting worse.\nTo the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nNational Security begins at the border.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East \u2013 meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nJust last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nThere is another major policy announcement I would like to make today. Every year, countless American lives are lost to Sanctuary Cities. My opponent strongly supports Sanctuary Cities, like the ones that got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant.\nIf I am elected President, I am going to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\nWe are going to save American lives.\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end common core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOur campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Ohio and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people \u2013 not the donors and special interests.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nBecause if we win \u2013\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n","63":"\nSecretary Clinton: \"Thank you. Your Eminence, Your Excellencies, members of the clergy, Al and Nan Smith, Donald and Melania, and all the distinguished guests.\nYou know, earlier tonight, Al reminded me that when the first Al Smith ran for presi-dent, he chose as his running mate the progressive senator from Arkansas, Joseph T. Robinson, who was one of my husband's political heroes.\nThis work that you do through the dinner \u2014 Al, you've done it now for 30 \u2014 30 years \u2014 is such a labor of love. You've been a hero for both the children of the archdiocese and for the city of New York. And I think we all owe Al Smith a great, great round of applause.\nThis is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here.\nAnd as you've already heard, it's a treat for all of you too, because usually I charge a lot for speeches like this.\nBut, for me, it was kind of ironic thinking about a fiery populist, Al Smith. If he were here today and saw how much money we've raised for needy children, he'd be very proud.\nAnd if he saw this magnificent room, full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy, he'd be very confused.\nIt's a special honor to be here with Your Eminence. Now I know, Your Eminence, you were criticized for inviting both Donald and me here tonight, and you responded by saying \"If I only sat down with those who were saints, I'd be taking all my meals alone.\"\nNow, just to be clear, I think the Cardinal is saying I'm not eligible for sainthood. But getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle.\nSo I guess I'm up against the highest, hardest stained-glass ceiling. But, Your Eminence, you deserve great credit for bringing together two people who've been at each other's throats \u2014 mortal enemies, bitter foes; I've got to ask, how did you get the governor and mayor here together tonight?\nNow, I've got to say, there are a lot of friendly faces here in this room; people that I've been privileged to know and to work with. I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables.\nAnd you look so good in your tuxes; or, as I refer to them, formal pantsuits.\nAnd, you know, because this is a friendly dinner for such a great cause; Donald, if at any time, you don't like what I'm saying feel free to stand up and shout \"Wrong!\" while I'm talking.\nYou know, come to think of it, it's amazing I'm up here after Donald. I didn't think he'd be okay with a peaceful transition of power.\nAnd, Donald, after listening to your speech, I will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.\nYou know, I've had the privilege of being at the Al Smith dinners in years past and I always enjoy it. But, remember, if you're not happy with the way it comes out, it must be rigged.\nAnd it's always a special treat for me to be back in New York; a city that I love and which I think truly embodies the best of America. You know \u2014 don't you think?\nPeople look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants, a beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a \"four.\"\nMaybe a \"five\" if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.\nYou know, come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman? Forty-five.\nBut I digress. Now, I'm going to try my best tonight, but I understand I am not known for my sense of humor. That's why it did take a village to write these jokes.\nPeople say \u2014 and I hear them, I know \u2014 they say I'm boring compared to Donald. But I'm not boring at all. In fact, I'm the life of every party I attend and I've been to three.\nAnd when the parties get out of hand, as occasionally they do, it's important to have a responsible chaperone who can get everyone home safely. And that is why I picked Tim Kaine to be my Vice President.\nNow, you notice there is no teleprompter here tonight, which is probably smart, because maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day. And I get that. They're hard to keep up with, and I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian.\nBut every year, this dinner brings together a collection of sensible, committed, main-stream Republicans \u2014 or, as we now like to call them \u2014 Hillary supporters.\nNow, some of my critics \u2014 and I hear that too \u2014\nAudience Member: Yeah.\nSecretary Clinton: Yeah.\nThey think I only say what people want to hear. Well, tonight, that is true. And here's exactly what you want to hear \u2014 this election will be over very, very soon.\nAnd look at this dais \u2014 we've got Charlie Rose, and Maria Bartiromo, and Chris Mat-thews, and Gayle King, and Norah O'Donnell, and Katie Couric \u2014 this counts as a press conference, right?\nIt is great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here.\nIt's a shame he's not speaking tonight. I'm curious to hear what a billionaire has to say.\nAnd look at the dais \u2014 we've got the Honorable Chuck Schumer, the Honorable Andrew Cuomo, the Honorable Mike Bloomberg, the Honorable Bill DeBlasio, the Honorable Dave Dinkins, and so many other wonderful elected officials. And we have Rudy Giuliani.\nNow, many don't know this, but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes. But, as the saying goes, \"If you can't beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.\"\nSo as I've said, we've now had our third and, thankfully, final debate. Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind.\nThere is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump. Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate. And look, I've got to tell you, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer.\nNow, actually, I did. It's called preparation.\nAnd looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates. And he says I don't have any stamina.\nThat is four and a half hours. I have now stood next to Donald Trump longer than any of his campaign managers.\nNow, look, I have deep respect for people like Kellyanne Conway. She's working day and night for Donald and because she's a contractor, he's probably not even going to pay her.\nBut I think the good news is that the debates finally allowed Republicans to unite around their candidate. The bad news is, it's Mike Pence. And it's been a long, long campaign. That should be one of our highest priorities, shortening the campaigns.\nAnd whoever wins this election, the outcome will be historic. We'll either have the first female president or the first president who started a Twitter war with Cher.\nAnd if Donald does win, it will be awkward at the annual President's Day photo, when all the former presidents gather at the White House, and not just with Bill.\nHow is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?\nNow, Republicans in particular seem frustrated with their nominee. Paul Ryan told the Republican members of the House, you \u2014 you don't have to support the top of the ticket. Don't worry about anyone besides yourself. Just do what's in your own best interests. So I guess Donald really has unified his party around his core philosophy.\nAnd I don't understand their unhappiness. They say Donald doesn't have any policies. He has no policies. I keep hearing that.\nI'd actually like to defend him on this. Donald has issues, serious issues.\nReally, really serious issues.\nAnd I worry about Donald's go it alone attitude. For example, at his convention, when he said I alone can fix it, you know, in the '90s, I said the same thing about America's health care system and it didn't work out so well for me, either.\nBut speaking of health, Donald has been very concerned about mine, very concerned. He actually sent a car to bring me here tonight. Actually, it was a hearse.\nBut I \u2014 but I kind of want to just put the information out there, so everybody can draw their own conclusions and you can judge our relative health. We've each released our medical records. My blood pressure is 100\/70. His is unbelievably great.\nMy cholesterol is 189, his is presidential.\nMy heart rate is 72 beats per minute, his is the most beats ever, or the least beats ever, whichever sounds best.\nBut Donald really is as healthy as a horse, you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.\nBut \u2014 but I can say without fear of contradiction tonight, that I will be the healthiest and youngest woman ever to serve as president.\nBut this has really been a strange campaign. You saw it last night. You saw it again tonight. Donald has attacked me for a life in public service and I didn't get that at first. I kind of get it now. As he told Howard Stern, he doesn't like it when women have been around for more than 35 years.\nBut Donald, we have so much more in common than, actually, you may realize.\nFor example, I tried to inspire young people by showing them that with resilience and hard work anything is possible and you're doing the same. A third grade teacher told me that one of her students refused to turn in his homework because it was under audit.\nAnd here's another similarity. The Republican National Committee isn't spending a dime to help either one of us.\nSo tonight, let's embrace the spirit of the evening. Let's come together. Remember what unites us and just rip on Ted Cruz.\nI hope you enjoyed my remarks tonight. I said no to some jokes that I thought were over the line. But I suppose you can judge for yourself on Wikileaks in the next few days.\nDonald will tell us after the benediction whether he accepts that this dinner is over. He has to wait and see.\nBut there's nothing funny about the stakes in this election. In the end what makes this dinner important are not the jokes we tell but the legacy that we carry forward. It is often easy to forget how far this country has come.\nAnd there are a lot of people in this room tonight who themselves, or their parents or grandparents, came here as immigrants, made a life for yourselves, took advantage of the American dream and the greatest system that has ever been created in the history of the world to unleash the individual talents and energy and ambition of everyone willing to work hard.\nAnd when I think about what Al Smith went through it's important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party's nominee for president. Don't forget \u2013 school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible. Voters were told that he would annul Protestant marriages.\nAnd I saw a story recently that said people even claimed the Holland Tunnel was a se-cret passageway to connect Rome and America, to help the Pope rule our country.\nThose appeals, appeals to fear and division, can cause us to treat each other as the Other. Rhetoric like that makes it harder for us to see each other, to respect each other, to listen to each other. And certainly a lot harder to love our neighbor as ourselves.\nI believe how we treat others is the highest expression of faith and of service. I'm not Catholic. I'm a Methodist, but one of the things that we share is the belief that in order to achieve salvation we need both faith and good works. And you certainly don't need to be Catholic to be inspired by the humility and heart of the Holy Father, Pope Francis. Or to embrace his message.\nHis message about rejecting a mindset of hostility, his calls to reduce inequality, his warnings about climate change, his appeal that we build bridges, not walls.\nNow as you may know, my running mate, Tim, is Catholic and went to Jesuit schools, and one of the things he and I have talked about is this idea from the Jesuits of the Magis, the more, the better. But we need to get better at finding ways to disagree on matters of policy while agreeing on questions of decency and civility. How we talk to each other, treat each other, respect each other.\nSo I've taken this concept of Magis to heart in this campaign, as best as one can in the daily heat, the back and forth of a presidential campaign, to ask how we can do more for each other, and better for each other. Because I believe that for each of us, our greatest monument on this earth won't be what we build, but the lives we touch.\nAnd that is ultimately what this dinner is all about. And it's why it's been such a great honor to join you all again. Thank you.\"\n","64":"\nIn 21 days, we are going to win the state of Colorado and we're going to win the White House. We're going to take it back. [applause]\nAnd while I'm at it, make sure you mail in those ballots before election day. Early voting starts on the 24th, you've got to mail them in. But get there, November 8th.\nI'd like to also start today by recognizing the incredible military contributions of Colorado Springs, a place I actually know very well. One of the most beautiful places, by the way. We have such amazing people working at Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Space Command, NORAD, Schriever Air Force Base and the United States Air Force Academy. Good place. [applause]\nI've got many friends that went to the Air Force Academy, all very smart. They love their airplanes, that I can tell you. The courage and selflessness of our service members and their devotion to each other and to their country are the traits that we need to make America great again. [applause]\nGreat people. Together, we're going to deliver real change that puts America first. You don't hear that term very much. We don't hear that term very much anymore, do we? America first, right? If I win, it's going to be America first every single time, that I can tell you. Believe me. [applause]\nWe're going to end the government corruption and we're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. [applause]\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees from other countries, reduce surging crime, cut taxes big league and end regulations. [applause]\nUnleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our great military, which sadly has become very depleted, but the greatest people on Earth. We're going to take care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. And repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. [applause]\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go down under a Trump administration. [applause]\nYour country and I tell you, your country is so proud of you, but right now we have to help our country. We have to help our country. It is under siege in so many ways. By the way, you could almost stay, especially from the dishonest media, that's for sure. [applause]\nVery dishonest. Your companies won't be leaving Colorado under a Trump administration. They'll be expanding and there will be new companies coming in. Right now, we're not growing at all as a nation. You look at our jobs report, a disaster. Last week a jobs report, total disaster. Look at our GNP, total disaster.\nUnder my plan, we're going to grow at 4 percent. Right now, we're at about 1 percent. [applause]\nChina's at 7 percent. India's at 8 percent. We're at 1 percent and it's going to be going down if we keep if Hillary Clinton gets in, you will set record lows, believe me. That I can tell you. [applause]\nWe're going to create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years. And by the way, did you see the protesters yesterday, where they call them. The protesters are paid a lot of money by the DNC. And I kept saying, I wonder why those people are here? Because they never seem to have much on their mind, other than stand up and protest.\nAnd yesterday it came out, but it was barely covered by the media. But it's all over the media. They were busted. They were paid $1,500 each and were given cell phones go up and disturb Trump rallies. And I sort of always knew it, in Chicago, even last night. We had people stand up for no reason. It's like, what are they doing here? And can you imagine, that's a big story, hardly covered by the media. [applause]\nSo bad. We're also going to create a new government that answers to the people. Hillary Clinton\u2014Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency. [applause]\nShe shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency after what she's done. I'll tell you. It's true. Newly released, two days ago, FBI documents reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The undersecretary of state, Patrick Kennedy, illegally pressured the FBI to unclassify e-mails from Hillary Clinton's illegal server. [applause]\nIt's hard to believe. And nothing happens to her, folks, and nothing ever happens. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access. [applause]\nThe FBI document show that Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a very, very serious quid pro quo. Not allowed to do it. This is a felony corruption. Yesterday, I said Undersecretary Kennedy must immediately resign. [applause]\nThe media barely covers this event, by the way. [applause]\nThis is a bigger event than Watergate and they practically refuse to cover it. Today, I'm calling for him to be fired. [applause]\nClinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all to her. [applause]\nRemember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress, saying that she never sent or received classified information on her secret server. Right? She never received it on that insecure server, that she should have never been allowed to have. That you're not allowed to have. And pretended not to know. Remember this one: that the letter \"C\" meant confidential information was classified. [applause]\nShe thought it was the lettering of a paragraph. [applause]\nThere's never been a time in our country's history where anything like this has gone on. And the FBI, there must be people in there, based on what you read, that are ashamed of what's happened. And the Department of Justice, there must be people in there that are ashamed, absolutely ashamed of what's been going on.\nHillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times. And then in written testimony last week, under oath, she said that she couldn't remember another 21 times. Bad memory. She's got a terrible memory. [applause]\nThis elaborate, criminal cover up included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 e-mails. The disappearance of 13 iPhones, some by hammers, two boxes of e-mail evidence gone missing, that was as of last week. Can you imagine they're now missing on top of everything else, two boxes of e-mails? And the destruction of laptops, in a secret deal with the FBI. [applause]\nThis truly is, and I said it, this truly is many times worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th. [applause]\nGoing to do it. [applause]\nAnother series of leaked e-mails show top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists. And then you wonder why we do so badly. But you don't hear the media talking about that at all, do you? You don't see it at all. As WikiLeaks proved, the media, is merely, and it truly is, it's just an extension of the Clinton campaign. [applause]\nThe press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters. They have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories. Most recently about phony allegations where I have been under constant attack. They attack my business. I built a great business but, although most people do admit that. They attacked my wonderful family. They attacked my temperament.\nBut I built an incredible company, those papers are filed. And I'm fortunate to have a beautiful and loving family. You all saw Melania last night on television. Did a great job. [applause]\nThat she even has to do that is a shame. And my temperament has always been just about my greatest strength. We have a winning temperament. Our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win anymore. This is an election about truth. And you're not going to get it from the dishonest media.\nSome people can't handle the truth. No matter what people may think of me, the one thing they know is that we're going to tell the American people where we stand, where we are. We're going to tell them the truth. [applause]\nNow even though we're doing pretty good in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore. I don't believe them. I don't believe them. And if there's 10, and if there's one or two bad ones, that's the only one they show.\nBelieve me, folks, we're doing great. If we keep our spirit, and if we go out and win, this is another Brexit, believe me. They are so worried. That's why they've become vicious and hostile and dirty because they see what's going on. This rally set up just a short while ago; look at the number of people, packed. But every rally is the same way. [applause]\nAt her rallies, very few people show up, when she has the energy to go to the event. Which isn't often. She's doing debate prep. She did so much debate prep. Did we beat her badly in that second debate? [applause]\nSort of funny. She's been doing this for 30 years. Now she has to do debate prep for five days. You know what the debate prep is? It's resting. It's lying down, going to sleep. I think the media's trying to discourage our people from going out to vote. And it was just brought up to me by a reporter in the back.\nThey said, you know, it's very interesting, when you were fighting 17 people, the media was nasty, but they really got nasty when we started to take the lead in the polls. They said, \"Wait a minute, this thing's going to happen. It's going to happen.\"\nChange stop our jobs from leaving, our companies from leaving, strengthen our military, preserve our Second Amendment. They're saying, this is going to happen. And it is true. Made up stories. They're liars and made up stories.\nWithout the media and all of the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way, she would be nothing. She would be nothing. She really\u2014she would be doing so badly. Even my worst critics agree that the media has come after us like they have never come after anyone before. It's my badge of honor.\nI mean, you know, what am I going to do? Even the New York Times, which is totally dishonest, by the way\u2014here's the good news about the New York Times. They won't be in business much longer. Do you see what they're losing? [applause]\nThey are dying. They are dying. And they're dying also because they're very dishonest. But one of their biggest columnist-reporters wrote a story about how bad it is. He said, let's face it\u2014this is in the New York Times \"balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto this golden Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy.\"\nCan you believe that? They're admitting it. They don't even care. It actually said that we don't care. They will do anything to stop what we're doing. Not me, it's what we're doing. It's an agenda. It's going to agenda of change. But we won't let them stop maybe the greatest movement in the history of our country.\nHistory is watching us now, waiting to see if we will rise to the moment. We have to rise. We have to do it. We're under tremendous opposition. We have the greatest people in the world. That's what I've learned. Somebody said, what's the most important thing you learned? How great the American people are. I've gone all over the country.\nI have two things I've learned that, and I've learned how totally dishonest the media is. It's so dishonest. I've learned that, too. They are the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with. Not all of them, but, honestly, like 75 percent. Some are very good, but for the most part, yes.\nWe have stories that we think are going to unbelievable stories. They turn out\u2014they make them as bad as possible. We have stories on the other side that would normally dismantle a campaign, and they don't even report them. It's a disgrace. What's going on is a disgrace.\nBut we've only just begun to fight, believe me. We have three weeks. You know what, we have three weeks. And I hear we're going great in Colorado. My people in back said, \"You're going to win Colorado, doesn't matter what they say.\" [applause]\nGet out and vote. But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt. And you see that. And voter fraud is all too common. And then they criticize us for saying that. And we have even Republicans, \"Oh, that's such a terrible thing to say.\"\nWell, take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on. Take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities where you see things happening that are horrendous. And if you talk about them, they say bad things about you. They call you a racist. They call you all\u2014and by the way, speaking of that, nobody will do more for the African-American citizens of this country than Donald Trump, nobody, nobody. Nobody will do more for the Latino community than Donald Trump, I can tell you.\nIn 2014, the Washington Post, another beauty, published an article entitled, \"Could Non-Citizens Decide the November Election?\" The article found that 14 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote, 14 percent were registered to vote. And we're not supposed to talk about it. And your Republican leaders said, \"Oh, this\u2014everything is peachy-dory,\" right? And it also found non-citizen voting may have given Democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed to pass Obamacare. It's a Washington policy, not me.\nThe system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Crooked Hillary's campaign. It's rigged. It's a bad system. The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA\u2014or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will also be a disaster\u2014NAFTA's the worst trade deal ever signed, ever made, by anybody in the world.\nWe're a one-way highway out. We get the drugs, right? We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. We get the empty factories. Mexico and other countries get the cash. They get the employment. They get the plants.\nAnd for completely open borders\u2014she wants completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move. If we let Crooked Hillary's cartel and\u2014and just remember this\u2014run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year that America lost, truly lost, its independence, truly lost its independence.\nAnd by the way, this is our final shot, folks. In four years, it's over. You're never going to be able to win. You're never going to be able to win. It's tilting. It's going to be a one-party system. This is your final shot for the Supreme Court, for your Second Amendment. I mean, this is your final shot, November 8th.\nSo hopefully you'll do what you know you have to do. Get out of bed and vote. No matter how you're feeling, no matter how you're feeling.\nIt is indeed time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. This is why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. First, I'm going to institute a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service, right?\nSecond, I'm going to ask Congress to institute its own five-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs. That's a simple one. And they know this should be done, but they're not going to do it, but they'll do it if I get in.\nI'm going to, number three, expand the definition of lobbyists so that we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves [applause]\nRight? I've been talking about that for years. Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end. And remember, by the time this ends, I will have spent over $100 million on my campaign. Hillary's spent nothing. She gets all her money from the special interest donors. And my interest is you; my interest is you. [applause]\nWe have to break the cycle of corruption, and we have to give new voices to change. And we have to\u2014we have no\u2014do we have a choice? So that we can have a government that works again and can function properly, which our government doesn't right now, including giving Iran $1.7 billion in cash. [booing]\nAnd remember the deportation of 800 people? Turned out to be 800 people, then went to 1,800 people.\nAnd they were going to be deported for good reason. You know, if our country deports somebody, they've got to be pretty, pretty out there. Well, they pressed the wrong button, and congratulations, we have 1,800 new citizens of the United States.\nAnd when I said, \"undo it,\" they said that wouldn't be constitutional. Hey, folks, how stupid are we being led? The time for congressional term limits has finally arrived. Not only will it end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation that we're in right now. No growth.\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. It will happen. [applause]\nAt the center of our historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, which I've wanted to do from the beginning; 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are living right now on food stamps. It's hard to believe this is our country.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world. And the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Do you know that? The worst since the Great Depression. Colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and a deal supported by Hillary Clinton very strongly.\nAnd this I thought was a typographical error, because I figured they meant 700 or 7,000, but it wasn't: We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.\nWe are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world. More jobs have been stolen from our country, so stupidly we let them go. We let our companies go so foolishly. We don't know what we're doing. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to the foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country, and have jobs come back in the other direction. [applause]\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause]\nWe are right now the highest-taxed nation in the world. That's one of the reasons our companies are leaving. We're also going to fix our inner cities\u201445 percent of African-American children, under the age of six are living in poverty; 58 percent of African-American youth are not working. Almost 3,500 people have been shot in the city of Chicago.\nCan you believe this? Since January 1st. The national murder rate has experienced the largest single year increase in more than 45 years. Can you believe that? Murder, highest rate in 45 years.\nSo you don't\u2014they don't seem to. She said, \"nobody cares.\" And you're right, they don't seem too. So to those African-Americans suffering, to those Latinos suffering, I say: What do you have to lose? Elect Donald Trump. I will fix it. We will fix it. [applause]\nWe will fix it. We're going to get a very big African-American vote. We're going to get a very big Latino vote. Because the Democrats come in, they want your vote. And as soon as you give them the vote, they say, \"See you in four years.\" They don't do anything. It's gotten worse and worse for both the African-Americans, the Latino-Hispanics. It's gotten worse and it will only get worse.\nThey want your vote. Hillary Clinton said she was going to fix up the state of New York when she ran for the Senate. It is a total disaster. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. [applause]\nOur national security begins at the border. Speaking in secret, to a foreign bank [applause]\nI promise, we will build the wall. [applause]\nHillary Clinton said her dream is for total open trade. There go your jobs; and open borders\u2014there goes your country. Simple as that.\nThere are already a record 65 million people in the United States who speak a language other than English. It's in their interest and everyone's interest to control immigration so past arrivals can integrate into society and really join the middle class and the upper class.\nBut in a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said, \"Citizens who want to control immigration are un-American.\" In other words, if you want to have a border, you want to have a wall, which creates a country. Even if you want people to come in, but come in through a legal process, she considers that un-American. So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers in the case of the Bernie Sanders people. She said they were basement dwellers. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nWe will be the great Trojan horse folks. As sure as you're standing there. Just today, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS. He entered as a refugee in November of 2009. And then we approved for a green card in 2011. It's one of hundreds of examples of the United States voluntarily admitting people from the world's most dangerous places who turn out to be terrorists.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. We have enough problems. [applause]\nWe have enough problems. We've got big problems: $20 trillion in debt. We have problems like you wouldn't believe. We'll also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. And we will build that wall and Mexico will pay for that wall. [applause]\nWe just got the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol Office. First time they've ever done it. ICE was just last week. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries would not take them back. They were too evil. They were too evil drug lords, heads of gangs. I mean these people were evil. They wouldn't take them back.\nSo we come over, we bring, they won't take them back. Oh, take them back, drop them on the streets. And then you wonder why the murder rate is the highest in 45 years and other things.\nThe ICE officer described Hillary's proposal as quote, \"The most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.\" Here's a summary of the Hillary plan. She wants to support sanctuary cities.\nShe wants Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens. They get taken care of better than our great vets. That won't happen. She wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants. Obamacare is not going to be here much longer, folks. You see what's going on. Regardless. No deportation of Visa overstays. Expanding catch-and-release on the border. She wants it expanded. In other words, catch them and say, \"Oh, you can go.\"\nExpanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers. Freeing even\u2014there go your jobs\u2014freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives.\nAnd this is to me, the beauty of them all. Obama has allowed thousands and thousands and thousands of people to come in, Syrians from the Middle East. She wants an increase of 550 percent in Syrian refugees into our country. [booing]\nEither we win this election, or we lose our country. Under a Trump administration, it's going to be America first. [applause]\nHere are some of the amazing things we're going to do for our country starting in 2017. We're so close. We have to get it over the line. We're so close. Forget the press. Read the internet, study other things, don't go for the mainstream media. Most of them\u2014good news\u2014fortunately most of them won't be around very much longer, in my opinion. They're going down. Financially, big trouble. A lot of big trouble. They've got a lot of big trouble. That's good.\nWe're going to have\u2014and I do get a lot of honesty over the internet. You do get some dishonesty, too, but at least you can separate it. We should have a choice. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe even bigger. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We are going to defend religious liberty, provide school choice to every low- income child in America. And get rid of common core so that we can have education locally. [applause]\nWe are going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nLaw and order and justice. Law and order and justice. We are going to save something that is under tremendous stress. We're going to save your Second Amendment. [applause]\nAnd we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nYou have 21 days to make every dream you've ever dreamed for you family, for your grandchildren, for you children, for yourself, for your country to come true. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. There's a lot of love in this room. A lot of love. And we don't want a divided country. We want to bring other people. We want to love everybody in our country. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and the elitism of our failed political establishment. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. That's you, and you.\nI am going to fight so hard for every citizen, of every background, for every single stretch of this nation. I am going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence, and the viciousness that it all builds.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have turned into dust. And those jobs and factories are not with us any more. They're in other countries, making everybody rich but us. [applause]\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. [applause]\nAnd with all the money she made, she doesn't put up any money into her own campaign. That's pretty remarkable. I'm doing it. I'm going to fight to bring us all together. We're not going to be divided anymore as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause]\nThank you. In 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, you're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this beautiful day in this great state and in this truly great country. This is a movement that they have never seen before. They've never seen anything like this before. There has never been like this before.\nYou're going to look back at this election and say, \"This is by far the most important vote, you've ever cast, for anyone at any time.\" [applause]\nOnce again, we're going to have a government of, by, and for the people. [applause]\nYou will see, and be so proud of your country again and hopefully you'll be so proud of your president again. [applause]\nWe will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\nThank you, everybody. God bless you. November 8th, go out and vote. November 8th. God bless you, everybody. [applause]\n","65":"\nThank you.\nIn 22 days, we are going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win the White House.\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure to send in your absentee ballots.\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration.\nWe are also going to end government corruption.\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President.\nNewly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The under-Secretary of State, Patrick Kennedy, pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillary's illegal server. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification.\nThis is a criminal conspiracy \u2013 a conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 emails, the disappearance of 13 phones, 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI.\nRemember, also, that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever, and pretended not to know that the letter \"C\" meant confidential information that was classified. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times, and then, in written testimony last week under oath, said she couldn't remember another 21 times.\nWe are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clinton's personal profit at your expense.\nBut it gets even worse.\nThe FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a \"quid pro quo.\" This is felony corruption. Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign.\nClinton cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety, and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all.\nThis is magnitudes worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th.\nBut there's still more. Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists. One of the emails from a top Hillary official said, quote, \"take the money!!\" with two exclamation points. This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments.\nRemember, we are competing in a rigged election \u2013 the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news, only to poison the minds of the American voters. The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, as WikiLeaks proved \u2013 Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate.\nA new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton. They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.\nThe following comes straight from Pew Research.\nQUOTE: \"Approximately 24 million\u2014one of every eight\u2014voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.\"\nQUOTE: \"More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters.\"\nQUOTE: \"Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.\"\nThen there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post. The article was entitled: \"could non-citizens decide the November election?\" Here are some excerpts.\nQUOTE: \"More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote.\"\nQUOTE: \"Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin.\"\nOur system is also rigged by the donors, giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clinton's campaign.\nThe reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move.\nIf we let the Clinton Cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence.\nWe will not let that happen.\nIt is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\nWhen Bill Clinton came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for 5 years after you leave. But then, President Clinton did what the Clintons always do \u2013 he rigged the system on his way out. Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash.\nSo, here is what I am announcing tonight. First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.\nSecond: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.\nThird: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.\nFourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\nAnd Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.\nNot only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nAt the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nIt's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA, and the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization.\nBriggs & Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China.\nGE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico.\nJohnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China.\nThe list goes on and on.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nA Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nNational Security begins at the border.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nBy \"open trade,\" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.\nBy \"open borders,\" she means totally unlimited immigration.\nIn a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens who want to control immigration are \"Un-American.\"\nSo Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders.\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East \u2013 meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\nThe ICE officers described Hillary's proposal as, quote, the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.\" Here is a summary of the Hillary plan:\n--Support for Sanctuary Cities\n--Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens\n--Obamacare for illegal immigrants\n--No deportation of visa overstays\n--Expanding catch-and-release on the border\n--Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers\n--Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives\n--A 550% increase in Syrian refugees\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\nUnder a Trump Administration, it's going to be America First.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 22 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people \u2013 not the donors.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nOnce again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n","66":"\nThank you.\nIn 24 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nWe are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, reduce the cost of college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump Administration.\nWe are going to be a rich country again.\nWe are also going to end government corruption. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency \u2013 and the media, donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense.\nThe Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election.\nThe documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillary's illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger.\nThey show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti.\nThey show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.\nThey also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign.\nTo cover-up her crimes, Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails \u2013 after a Congressional Subpoena \u2013 she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence mysteriously went missing.\nHillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes \u2013 and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary \u2013 supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren \u2013 is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.\nInstead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.\nBut we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen. We are just getting started.\nAmericans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries.\nThis will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nBy \"open trade,\" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.\nBy \"open borders,\" she means totally unlimited immigration.\nWhen she thought no one was listening, Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.\nEither we win the election, or we lose the country.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nA wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.\nWhen I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities. I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you \u2013 we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves.\nNew Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country.\nWe have to solve this crisis.\nI have to give credit to my running mate, Mike Pence, on this issue.\nMike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction.\nWe must make similar efforts a priority for the nation.\nNot too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other. Their story of prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic.\nFirst, we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country.\nThe number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008.\nI've received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers, and under a Trump Administration, we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good.\nWe are also going to put an end to Sanctuary Cities, which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation.\nWe will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country.\nWe will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs.\nPresident Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals.\nOver the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels.\nSecond, we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service.\nThese traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S.\nA Trump administration will crack down on this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission.\nThird, we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse.\nIt is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction. We should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get help.\nThe FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs. And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat.\nRecovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives. We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted to those drugs, we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need.\nAs president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision.\nAt the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S. We have 5 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids.\nFinally, we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need.\nCongress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This legislation is an important step.\nI would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment. These can be a cost effective, appropriate, and humane response to addiction.\nI would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment.\nI would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives.\nI would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration. Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention.\nTogether, these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs.\nBut, if we are going to bring hope back to our communities, we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis.\nThe wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams.\nAt the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nThis is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.\nThe state of New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal \u2013 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat\nChrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico.\nRight here in New Hampshire, I visited the Osram Sylvania plant that closed its doors in 2014 and shipped its jobs to China and Mexico.\nIf I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.\nWe are going to start making things in America again.\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe will have a 10% tax on money parked overseas, bringing trillions in wealth back into our country.\nManufacturers will be able to expense the cost of new investment and equipment, to help make our country more competitive.\nWe will lower taxes massively on all Americans \u2013 Hillary will raise your taxes massively.\nWe will become the great jobs magnet of the world.\nWages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation \u2013 and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nOnce again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe will make America wealthy again.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we are going to make America great again.\n","67":"\nThank you.\nIn 24 days, we are going to win the state of Maine and we are going to win the White House.\nMake sure to get your absentee ballots.\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nWe are also going to replace a failed political class that has betrayed our workers, spent trillions on endless foreign wars without victory, and destroyed our middle class.\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your energy bills will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Maine under a Trump Administration.\nWe are going to be a rich country again.\nWe are also going to end government corruption.\nHillary speaks in secret to Goldman Sachs \u2013 her private position \u2013 then lies to you, the public, with her public position. It's all a fraud.\nHillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails \u2013 after a Congressional Subpoena \u2013 she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing.\nHillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes \u2013 and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary \u2013 supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren \u2013 is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.\nInstead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.\nBut we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen.\nWe have only just begun to fight.\nAmericans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\" Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to this country or its workers.\nBy \"open trade,\" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.\nBy \"open borders,\" she means totally unlimited immigration.\nEither we win the election, or we lose the country.\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East \u2013 meaning generations of radicalism within our shores. She wants us to follow the path of France and Germany and import terrorism directly into the United States.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nIt was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, including one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.\nWhat kind of government allows its own people to suffer such horrors?\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. Among those she allowed to go free was a criminal alien who had previously been convicted for shooting a girl in the head \u2013 after his release, he viciously murdered a young girl name Casey Chadwick.\nA wall will not only keep out criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.\nDrugs overdoses in Maine are on a record pace.\nI have outlined a plan to stop the opioid crisis. My plan begins with a strong border, includes the prosecution of drug dealers, and dramatically expands access to life-saving treatments that will help people unchain themselves from this terrible addiction.\nBut, if we are going to bring hope back to suffering Americans, we must also solve our jobs crisis.\nAt the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nThis is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.\nWhen I am President, everything will change. We will move people from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls. We will end our chronic trade deficits. We will start growing again.\nWe'll rebuild our roads, schools, bridges, tunnels, railways, hospitals and airports.\nThe state of Maine has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal \u2013 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nIf I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.\nWe are going to start making things in America again.\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe will lower taxes massively on all Americans \u2013 Hillary will raise your taxes massively. Our biggest reductions will be for the working and middle class \u2013 this includes letting parents deduct the cost of childcare.\nReagan's tax cuts in the eighties, and Kennedy's tax cuts in the sixties, brought us tremendous growth. My economic reforms \u2013 on taxes, trade, regulation and American energy \u2013 will produce at least 25 million newjobs in a decade. It's the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.\nWe are also going to protect the right of the people of Maine to use their own land.\nPresident Obama, with the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton, issued an executive order 2 months ago making over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new \"National Monument.\" No consideration was made for local concerns, impacts to jobs, or the Maine forestry sector. No approval by Congress. Your state legislature opposed it. It is just another federal overreach that is going to do more harm than good. Obama and Clinton don't care that this area badly needs jobs and growth and that this decision -- done at the stroke of the pen without the support of the local community-- undermines the people that live and work here in Maine.\nBut we are going to turn it all around. America's comeback begins on November 8th.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every worker who deserves a raise, and for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people \u2013 not the donors.\nI'm going to fight for every patriotic citizen that Hillary Clinton slanders as deplorable and irredeemable \u2013 and I am going to be a President for all of our citizens.\nI am going to fight to bring us together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nOnce again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe will make America wealthy again.\nWe will make America powerful again.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we will make America great again.\n","68":"\nThank you.\nI am so happy to be back here in Columbus. Make sure you request your absentee ballot to vote by mail. And remind your friends and family to do the same.\nWe are now 26 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes.\nAnd we've only begun to fight.\nIf we win, we will create a booming and thriving economy for young Americans. We will create safe communities, lower taxes, leaner government, affordable childcare and healthcare, and a government that is honest and decent and fair.\nWe are the campaign of change.\nWe will deliver jobs, opportunity and justice for future generations.\nI've wanted this race to be about the issues. But the Clinton Campaign has refused to discuss the issues. They only place they want to go is the gutter.\nSo they have slandered and libeled me with false accusations \u2013 but we will not let these lies distract us from our campaign.\nIn an earlier speech today, I addressed the fact that I was falsely accused. It is disgraceful that you can have front page articles in the New York Times inventing false claims, without any evidence, any witnesses, anything at all.\nI want to talk about the policies affecting our lives, and your future.\nRight now, our government has been taken hostage by global special interests that will stop at nothing to drain every last ounce of wealth from this country for their personal benefit.\nThe greatest weapon wielded by the Clinton Machine is the media. The WikiLeaks emails show that the Clinton Machine and the Corporate Media are one in the same \u2013 they collaborate and conspire together.\nThis Washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of us.\nThese are the people who have given us decades of endless wars producing only death and bloodshed, but no victory.\nThese are the same people who have flung our doors open to Radical Islam, putting us on the same path to France of multigenerational struggles with violence and extremism embedded in our communities.\nThese are the people who've allowed violent international cartels to invade our country and prey on our most vulnerable citizens. Victims like Marilyn Pharis, raped by an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record and beaten to death with a hammer.\nThese are the people who've let drugs pour into our country and poising our children.\nThese are the people who emptied the jobs out of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina and shipped them to other countries.\nThe political powers trying to stop us are the people who've stripped the jobs form our inner cities, trapped millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in impoverished, crime-besieged neighborhoods, and left 70 million American women and child in poverty or near the brink of poverty.\nAt the center of this assault on American prosperity is the Clinton Machine. They don't work for you, they don't work for America, the work only for themselves and their donors \u2013 including foreign government and foreign actors.\nHillary Clinton is a criminal who destroyed 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena.\nShe ignored hundreds of requests for security in Benghazi, causing the deaths of four brave Americans \u2013 and then she lied to the faces of the grieving parents about the reason for the attack.\nShe defended a man who violently and viciously raped a 12 year-old girl by horribly smearing and blaming the victim \u2013 and the she laughed about getting the rapist off the hook.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary pledged her support for \"open borders.\" That means tens of millions of new foreign workers to compete against you for your jobs, your wages, your futures \u2013 she's selling out the future of young American, of all backgrounds, to enrich her donors.\nWe won't let it happen.\nHillary and her special interest allies want to keep children in our inner cities trapped in failing schools.\nUnder a Trump Administration, disadvantaged children will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.\nUnder President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the national debt has almost doubled.\n$20 trillion-dollar national debt is a weight around the future of every young person in this country. It would require $120,000 from every millennial in the country to pay off.\nThe new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over.\nYet, not one penny of that new debt has gone to lowering your tuition.\nThe share of 16-to-28-year-olds not in the labor force has increased to 45 percent during the Obama administration.\nIn a Trump Administration, we will work every day to make America great again for millennials.\nFirst, we will Lower the Cost of College and Solve the Student Loan Crisis.\nTuition at public four-year institutions was 40% higher in the last school year than it was ten years ago.\nIn all, Americans owe $1.3 trillion on their student loans--more than auto loans, credit card debt, or home equity loans nationwide.\nStudents should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford, and the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.\nThat is why under my student loan program, we would cap repayment to an affordable portion of a borrower's income--12.5%. And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we will let them get on with their lives.\nThat's the nature of the deal we give many public employees today.\nEvery American deserves the same deal, so we will equalize treatment so everyone can start saving for their families and retirement by the time they are 15 years out of college.\nIn addition, I will take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition. If the federal government is going to subsidize student loans, it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their students.\nIf colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously, they will be held accountable--including by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments tax-exempt.\nSome schools are paying more to hedge funds and private equity managers than they are spending on tuition assistance--while taxpayers are guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of student loans to pay for rising tuition.\nWe want universities to spend their endowments on their students, not themselves. They need to use that money to cut the college debt and college tuition.\nMuch of the skyrocketing cost of college education is due to the tremendous bloat in college administrators and bureaucrats. According to the Department of Education, the number of college administrators is up more than 60 percent since 1993--ten times the increase in tenured faculty positions.\nFederal regulations are responsible for much of this administrative bloat. Vanderbilt University estimated that it spends $150 million per year---11 percent of the university's budget--to comply with government regulations.\nAs president, I will immediately take steps to drive down college costs by reducing the unnecessary costs of compliance with federal regulations so that colleges can pass on the savings to students in the form of lower tuition.\nI will also make it a priority to protect students' rights to free speech on campus. In the past few decades, political correctness has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debate, to a place of extreme censorship where students are silenced.\nWe will end the political correctness, and foster free and respectful dialogue.\nWe also have to recognize that traditional four-year degree programs are not the only path to a good job and a good career. We should support schools that allow people to learn skills and practice a trade so young people can have access to the education that's right for them. And we must hold all schools equally accountable for their performance.\nI will make sure that students have the information they need about all of their options before starting school, and for repaying their student loans upon leaving school.\nThere is a lot of room for improvement in this regard. Currently, students navigate 16 complex repayment plans, 8 forgiveness programs, and 32 deferment and forbearance options\u2014each of these programs has their own nuances and qualifications. I will simplify this confusing maze into a single Income-Based Repayment Program, similar to those that have proved so popular in recent years.\nWe also have to make sure that those who have graduated college and those who are soon to graduate can find a good job to start a good career when they do.\nMany mothers across this country are worried their kids won't find jobs, and they are right to be worried. One of the biggest threats is outsourcing \u2013 jobs for college-educated kids are being sent to other countries. At the same time, companies are importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans.\nWe will protect these jobs for Americans.\nMy economic plan \u2013 including tax, trade regulatory, and energy reforms \u2013 will create 25 million new jobs and allow the private sector to grow at 4 percent per year.\nThis includes reforms to protect and expand the sharing economy--startups like Uber--that have managed to provide great services to consumers, and create lots of jobs in the process.\nFinally, and most importantly, the foundation for a new prosperity will be a rededication to the constitutional rule of law.\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.\nTogether, we are going to make America great again.\n","69":"\nThank you, it is so great to be here in Florida.\nIn 26 days, we are going to win the state, and we are going to win the White House.\nOur movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People.\nThere is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense.\nThe Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself.\nThe establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass, involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists.\nFor those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.\nThis is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.\nThe political establishment that is trying everything to stop us, is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry. The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries throughout the world. Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above one percent. Workers in the United States, were making less than they were almost 20 years ago \u2013 and yet they are working harder.\nIt's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\nJust look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan \u2013 and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and across our country. They have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.\nThe Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure. We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.\nAnd, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates. Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.\nWith their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before \u2013 and we won't let them do that.\nThe most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media. Let's be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda. And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.\nFor them, it is a war \u2013 and for them, nothing is out of bounds.\nThis is a struggle for the survival of our nation. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.\nThis is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.\nThe establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed. They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and reputation. And they will lie, lie and lie even more.\nThe Clintons are criminals. This is well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power. Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 phones, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and on and on.\nPeople who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything.\nAnd so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine, the New York Times, and other media outlets, as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack.\nIt is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time, as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine \u2013 including 2,000 more emails this morning\nThese claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false \u2013 and the Clinton Machine knows it is. It's all fabricated. It's pure fiction and outright lies. These events never happened. The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic.\nWe already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time. These lies come from outlets whose past stories, and past claims, have already been discredited. The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts, because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears.\nWhat's happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people, like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine \u2013 and that magazine should be put out of business.\nSix months ago, the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me, and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately. She said I was a great guy, and never made those remarks.\nWe demanded a retraction, but they refused to print it \u2013 just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things.\nThat story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times. It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them. Now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the times, tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago \u2013 another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing.\nAlso, a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was lovely but last night we hear, after 12 years, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances. I ask a very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? I was one of the biggest stars on television, and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year. Take a look at her words. It would have been the headline. No, it only appears 26 days before the election.\nThis invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony \u2013 the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false.\nThis weekend, the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years. But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them. Others have likewise were presented with this story, but after seeing the evidence we provided, refused to print it.\nThis is part of a concerted effort, led by the New York Times, which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival, and which probably won't even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook, has become more and more vicious and vile.\nI will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people.\nBut let me state this as clearly as I can. These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies. They are false and slanderous in every respect. We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime \u2013 indeed one the most important elections in modern history \u2013 and the polls show us in a dead heat. And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead.\nSo now, the Clinton Machine, has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met, worked with and employed \u2013 in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense. Again, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government.\nWhen I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in. I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics. I knew they would throw every lie they could at me, and my family, and my loved ones.\nI knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me.\nBut I take all of these slings and arrows for you. I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back.\nOur great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.\nWe've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty.\nBut the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.\nTheir financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.\nOur political establishment has no soul.\nI knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.\nThe only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.\nThey control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States \u2013 in the back of her airplane, while on the runway \u2013 for 39 minutes \u2013 to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.\nLikewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he's done to one of our great institutions. Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more \u2013 and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.\nThis is a conspiracy against you, the American people.\nThis is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.\nI didn't need to do this. I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks. I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.\nSome people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell. But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.\nIn my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else \u2013 and I know what's like to be an insider. Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam. Because I used to be part of the club, I'm the only one who can fix it. I'm doing this for the people, and this movement is just right \u2013 and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.\nThe corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise. They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you. The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future \u2013 but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.\nIf this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly successful person \u2013 which is what our country needs \u2013 will ever again run for this office.\nI will not lie to you. These false attacks hurt. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family, is painful.\nWhat the Clinton Machine is doing to me, and my family, is egregious beyond words. It is reprehensible beyond description.\nBut I also know, it's not about me \u2013 it's about all of you. It's about all of us, together, as a country.\nIt's about the Veterans who need medical care, the mothers who've lost children to terrorism and crime, it's about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help, it's about the millions of jobless Americans. This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare, and it's about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution.\nThis election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton. They've robbed these citizens of their future, and I will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back. I will deliver.\nThis election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace.\nWe will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters.\nWe will vote for the country we want.\nWe will vote for the future we want.\nWe will vote for the politics we want.\nWe will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business. We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country \u2013 and the disenfranchisement of our people.\nOur Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.\n","70":"\n\"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Wow.\nAudience: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThank you so very, very much. Wow. I am so happy to be back here and to be here with all of you. I am thrilled. And I can't thank you enough.\nAnd it's a special privilege and pleasure to be introduced by my friend and such a great leader, someone who has served not only this state so well, but also our country. And so I want to thank -- once again, I want to thank former senator and former secretary, Ken Salazar.\nAnd I also want to thank somebody else who's here who is really special and is doing such a great job for all of you. And that is your senator, and I hope you will get out and send him back to Washington, Michael Bennet.\nI also want to recognize someone who's running a great race for congress, Gail Schwartz.\nI -- I was thinking -- I was thinking, the first time I came to this beautiful place and had a chance to meet people from here was in 1992.\nI was here for somebody else, namely my husband who was running for president.\nAnd I know there are a lot of really young people here, but was anybody here back in 1992?\nWell, Bill and I talk about Pueblo all the time. And it is always a treat for either one of us to come. And today, it's especially important because we are getting closer and closer and closer to the next election. And we're also very conscious of the fact that here in Colorado for the first time, you are all going to be able to vote by mail.\nAnd this Monday, October 17th, ballots will start being mailed to Colorado voters.\nNow, if you've already registered to vote, I hope you'll keep your eye open for the mail and fill out your ballot. Send it back as quick as you can. Don't wait to fill it out.\nDon't do what I do, put it on the kitchen counter and then you put something else on top of it and something else and pretty soon you're wondering, \"Where is that ballot? I know it cam here a few days ago.\" So please put it in the mail so we can get every early vote counted quickly and avoid a big backlog on election night.\nAnd maybe -- if you haven't registered to vote yet, please do it right now. And if you go to Iwillvote.com, you can do that on your phones -- you do that right now -- you can get registered. Pretty easy, huh?\nBecause we need everybody to vote in this election. And we need your friends and your family and everyone you can reach, because this is about something so important. I don't know that there's ever been a more serious or consequential election. And we can see that people feel that way, because across America, people are already voting in high numbers.\nA lot of states have what's called early vote, and the numbers are bigger than anybody thought. And bigger than they've been in the past.\nJust this morning in Ohio, people began lining up last night so they could be sure to vote. They couldn't wait to cast their ballots. And by the time we're done, we expect record numbers of people to vote in this presidential election.\nSo don't be left out because we need you. And oh by the way, if you've got friends in Utah or Arizona make sure they vote too. We are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want to turn out as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent.\nAnd you know, your vote can make all the difference. I was in Florida yesterday with former Vice President Gore.\nAnd as he said yesterday, take it from him, every vote counts. So don't sit this one out. And I'm very proud of the campaign we've run. I'm proud of the campaign Bernie Sanders and I ran.\nIt was about -- it was about issues, not insults. We were setting forth a positive agenda that would help America. And help millions and millions of Americans get ahead and stay ahead.\nAnd to me, that is what we're supposed to be doing. We're supposed to bring people together. We're supposed to unify our country. We're supposed to solve our problems by working together.\nAnd I know it's been a long race, but as soon as our primary finished, Senator Sanders and I got together and came up with a plan to make college affordable and pay back student debt, provide more healthcare. And we have done our best to stay out of all the meanness.\nYou know, the other night -- did you see that last debate?\nWell, I was watching my opponent just go lower and lower and lower. And I was reminded of what my friend, and our first lady, Michelle Obama says.\nWhen they go low, we go high.\nAnd I want you to know I want to be -- I want to be the president for everyone. I am tired of the all the divisions and the barriers. I want to bring people together across our party lines, across any lines that divide us. And not just people who vote for me, I want to be the president, yes, for Democrats, but also Republicans and Independents.\nAnd I am very grateful for all of the Republicans who are supporting me. And I am very -- I'm very appreciative of all of the newspapers that are endorsing me, some of whom have never endorsed a Democrat before.\nSo we're going to keep running this campaign. I want to give you something to vote for, not just something to vote against.\nAnd during these next 28 days, we're going to crisscross our country. We're going to be talking about what we can do together. But Donald Trump is taking a very different tone.\nHis campaign -- his campaign said today that they're going to use a, quote, \"scorched Earth\" strategy for the remaining four weeks of this race. Now, that just shows how desperate they are. That's all they have left, pure negativity, pessimism.\nAnd we're not going to let Donald Trump get away with it, are we?\nI don't care what he says about me. I -- I -- I care about what he says about you. And I'll tell you what, I will stand up and defend every single person in this country from the insults and the disrespect that we hear from him.\nNow, the whole world has heard how Donald Trump treats women and what he thinks of women.\nAnd he is doubling-down on his excuse that it's just, quote, \"locker room talk.\"\nWell, you know what happened? It just kind of happened spontaneously. A lot of athletes and coaches started posting on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook. I mean, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the NFL, and more. They are coming together and they're saying, \"That doesn't happen in our locker rooms.\"\nBut of course, you know, it's not only women that he has disrespected. He's insulted practically everybody. He went after a distinguished federal judge, Judge Curiel, who was born in Indiana. And Trump said, \"Well, he couldn't be trusted because his parents were Mexican.\"\nHe has targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos. He's targeted POWs, people with disabilities, moslems, and so many others.\nAnd every time he does that I get somebody who is worried or scared, writing me a letter or talking to me. And especially children. It's really who Donald Trump is. But when you scare children, you know, like a little boy. His mother wrote to me. She had adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. There were a lot of children in Ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families. Their parents, their grandparents were not around. And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old. He's only lived in the United States. And his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing Donald Trump, he turned to her and asked, 'Mommy, will he send me back to Ethiopia?'\nThat's the kind of fear and anxiety that I hear from immigrant families who are scared to death, especially the children, that Donald Trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door, school to school, business to business, home to home.\nAnd it is hard to explain to children. And so I hope that if you know any children who are listening and watching and hearing some of what is said, you will reassure them. I want every boy and girl to know the American dream is big enough for you and there is a place in America for you.\nAnd that in this election, we will demonstrate that America is better than what Donald Trump says and represents.\nBut here's what I also want to know. We have a big difference about how best to get the economy going. You know, Trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\nYou know, that's called trickle down economics, but as with anything when it comes to Donald Trump, he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever, ever had. So I believe differently. We're going to invest in the middle class. We're going to invest in you, in your jobs, in your future.\nAudience: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nWell, you know, you do have to feel a little sorry for them. They've had a really bad couple of weeks.\nBut you know, part of the difference in how we see the economy I think comes from our experiences. You know, Donald grew up the son of a millionaire. He got started in business by borrowing $14 million from his dad. So it's not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy, because that's his own experience. I grew up differently. My father was a factory worker. Well, my grandfather was a factory worker. My father was a small businessman. I know how hard they worked and I am grateful for the middle class life that they gave us, and that's what I want to make sure everybody gets.\nThat's why I believe we've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, and we're going to focus on those issues. We're going to make it possible to have more good jobs in infrastructure. We need to fix our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports and our airports.\nAnd we need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share because here's what we've learned, Donald Trump hasn't paid a penny in federal income tax in years.\nNow this is all allegedly because of course we don't know for sure because he won't release his income taxes but it's allegedly because he lost $1 billion running casinos. Now I ask you, who loses $1 billion running casinos, right?\nDo you know how hard that is? But think about it, it means he's contributed zero. Zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military.\nHe calls the United States military a disaster.\nWell the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support America.\nNow, you've all heard his slogan, Make America Great Again, right? Well that would have maybe some truth to it if he made anything in America and if he bought things that are made in America. There are so many examples but let me just give you one, which is close to your hearts, because Pueblo is one of the largest steel producing cities in America, right?\nSo you know how important it is to support our steel workers and our steel industry.\nNow, Trump is the guy who went around for a year talking about how he was on the side of workers and all the rest of it. No truth to it, but you know, he did say it over and over again and we've slowly but surely uncovered how little he's done to help anybody except Donald Trump.\nAnd he has bought Chinese steel for his buildings. Not American steel. He could be buying American steel, he should be buying American steel. If he wants to make America great again, start by America with American steel.\nI have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure, which uses American steel, we're going to do more on advanced manufacturing, on technology and innovation, on clean energy jobs and we're going to make the economy fairer at the same time. And here's what I want the young people and their families to hear.\nSenator Sanders and I got together on a plan. We are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else.\nIf you already have debt because you're trying to get your education, we're going to help you refinance it. It is wrong that you could refinance a home and refinance car but you can't refinance your student debt. And we're going to make it possible for you to pay it back as a percentage of your income.\nNow, based on this plan, we will save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can go to hillaryclinton.com\/calculator to see how much you and your family can save. Because we want to liberate young people and families from the burden of college debt.\nAnd we're also gonna make the economy fairer by raising the national minimum wage so people who work full-time won't be in poverty.\nAnd we're going to expand Social Security for those who need it the most - low income seniors and widowed women.\nAnd we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\nI'm going to introduce reform. I can't wait to work with Senator Bennet, I can't wait to have a chance to make sure that we are working on immigration reform from the very beginning. We're gonna finally help dreamers achieve their dream of following their future and becoming American citizens.\nI also think it is past time, don't you, to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\nYou know I started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because it's not only a woman's issue it's a family issue. If you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister it's your issue. Right? You know that.\nSo Donald Trump always says, you know I'm playing the woman card. And my response is pretty simple. If being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman's card, then deal me in.\nYou see I am very excited, I am very excited about what we could do. You know I give President Obama a lot of credit. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I remember, because he called and asked me to come see him shortly after the election.\nAnd I didn't know why. He wanted me to be secretary of state but I didn't know that. But I got there and the first thing he says is, \"It's so much worse than they told us.\"\nAnd it was. You remember. It was terrible. Millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time. We have dug ourselves out of that ditch, thanks to everybody's hard work.\nAnd we can't ever go back there because believe me, trickle-down economics and refusing to regulate Wall Street and the mortgage market is what got us into that mess in the first place.\nAnd Donald Trump wants to get rid of the new rules on Wall Street. He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which returns money to people who've been defrauded by big companies. Well I have a totally different view.\nWe're gonna keep those and then we're going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to they're gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny, every penny, of tax benefit they've ever gotten.\nAnd I've been very clear about how we're gonna pay for what I want to do. It is going to be going after the wealthy, closing the loopholes on corporations.\nI can pledge to you, I will never raise middle class federal taxes. It is not right.\nAnd what I've been trying to do listening to people around the country is figure out what we can do to help you with what I call kitchen table issues. And we thank you very much.\nWhat - right now - thank you.\nYou know, I always feel so welcome when I come to Pueblo. I think I'll come here anytime it gets hard in the White House. What do you say?\nFinally I want to tell you that I want to make it easier for you to raise your kids. You know, there is nothing more important.\nI'm now a grandmother of two wonderful grandchildren, a little girl, a little boy. And there are too many hard-working families struggling with the cost of raising children.\nSo right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit. It gives a middle-class family $1000 per child to help you defray the costs. I'm going to double - I'm going to double the child tax credit.\nThat's another $1,000 for young kids to pay for the things you need, whether it's child care, housing, prescription drugs, groceries, or anything else, it is just one example of the tax relief I want to give to working families and we're going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most.\nWe're going to lift families out of poverty. In fact, the changes I am proposing we think will automatically help more people get out of poverty and we're going to look for other ways to help you.\nWhat I am interested in is your success, your futures, your possibilities, your dreams. I want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives.\nThat is how I was raised. That's what I want for you and every single family, every single child in America!\nSo we have about four weeks ago. It's going to be - it's going to be a race to the finish line, my friends. And here is what I want to ask you.\nAs I said in the beginning, think about everything that is important to you, whether it is jobs and rising incomes, whether it is education, healthcare, whatever it might be. Whether it is protecting our rights.\nPeople who have fought so hard, whether it is immigration reform, whatever it might be, think about it because you know what?\nThose issues will be on the ballot. They may not be listed there, but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and Donald Trump.\nAnd I know that if people turn out, I know if people show up, we're going to win and we're going to be able to do everything I've talked about.\nAnd so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail, you fill it in, you send it back, you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted.\nYou know, when I think about this election, I do think about my grandchildren a lot. Yeah, you, too, right?\nI'll tell you what, for those of you who aren't grandparents yet, it is an incredible experience. Right?\nAnd there is nothing I wouldn't do for them. As I like to say, face time was invented for grandparents, and you get to check in and see how they're doing. But more than that, what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them?\nI know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child. Make sure every child has a good education, a good school, good teachers, and every zip code in America. Make sure every child -- every child has the healthcare that he or she needs. That's why I work to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, so we can take care of millions of children.\nThat's why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids.\nI got into this work so many years ago. I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, right out of law school. And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids. And the reason I did that is because of my own mother.\nI didn't know it when I was just a little girl, but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own, and then at the age of eight, holding her little three-year-old sister's hand, she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents.\nIt turned out the grandparents didn't really want her either. So by the age of 14, she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter. But here's what I want you to know. It sounds pretty harsh. It was difficult. It made a profound impression on her life. I think my mom, who lived to the wonderful age of 92, I don't think there was a day that went by that she didn't think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own.\nBut, along the way, people were kind to her. People helped her. The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day, because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school, so she said to her, Dorothy, if you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.\nNow, you'll have to come right back home. That might sound kind of unfortunate, but for my mom, it was a gift, because she really wanted to go to high school.\nAnd so my mother always cared about other people. And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else, right.\nAnd we need to show each other more kindness and support. And the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away, we should be drawing people toward us.\nWe should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children. That's what I think about when I imagine, if I'm so fortunate enough to become president, I think about waking up -- waking up \u2014\nI think about waking up in the White House every morning trying to figure out what can I do to help somebody else and who can I work with? How many families and communities across America will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her God given potential?\nThat's what I think we are called to do. Whether you're a person of faith or not, the American dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up. Nobody, nobody makes it alone. Everybody has somebody who helps them along the way.\nSo let's pull together, Pueblo, let's get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children. God bless you, thank you.\"\n","71":"\nThank you everybody. This is a big, big crowd, you know? [applause]\nI'll tell you the same thing, however, the only people that will be shown on television won't be the 15,000 people, it'll be this group right over here. [applause]\nSo, the good news is, you have better seats, or standing room only, but you have better, but they're going to be more famous, right? They're going to be more famous. [applause]\nLook, we want to have the cameras circle around and show this crowd, will you do that cameras? [applause]\nGo ahead cameras. [applause]\nThey never do it. They never do it, so we won't waste our time, it's just the dishonest media. Look. [applause]\nWe love being here, I love being with you. I love this state, as you know, I'm here all the time. [applause]\nIn 27 days, we're going to win Florida [applause]\nand we're going to win back the White House. [applause]\nAnd that's what's happening folks, that's what's happening. [applause]\nWe're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to end illegal immigration, we're going to renegotiate our totally disastrous I mean these deals, aye yai yai the trade deals the worst. We're going to renegotiate those trade deals, reduce surging crime. You saw what happened the other day, murders in the United States, the highest level in 45 years. You don't hear that from the press. [booing]\nWe're going to cut taxes big league. Crooked Hillary is going to raise taxes. We're going to cut taxes and regulations. We're going to reduce the costs of education. By the way, we're going end the Common Core, and we're bringing our education local. [applause]\nWe're going to lift the restrictions on American Energy and deliver real change for our great American people; it's time. [applause]\nAnd when it comes to international government, to massive trade deals, and to America's borders, we're going to defend the freedom and sovereignty of the United States of America like never before. [applause]\nAnd we are going to once again put America first. [applause]\nThe deadline for voter register who is not registered? Is there anybody in here not registered? If you're not registered, get the hell out of here, OK? [applause]\nThere's a nice looking young guy hey listen, leave right now and go and register. [applause]\nThey just extended it for a little while, so right after you, raise your right hand. Do you promise you're going to register after this? If you like what I say, OK, if you like what I say. [applause]\nSeriously, I'm curious, who is not registered in this room? OK, all young people. Believe me, the young people like me better than Bernie, I'm telling you. [applause]\nBecause with me, when you graduate from college, you're going to come out and you're going to have a vast array of jobs. OK, right? [applause]\nSo go out and register, and we're going to have an awfully big I'll tell you what, honestly, we're going to have a big four years, eight years, we're going to have a big, great future for our country. [applause]\nAlso, you can request an absentee ballot and you can vote by mail, if necessary. So, register, request a ballot.\nThank you. I love you. I love you, too.\nThe Hillary Clinton documents have you been seeing this, what's going on? Released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in November and how unattractive and dishonest our country has become.\nThe election of Hillary Clinton would lead, in my opinion, to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it. She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office. And I don't think it would be close.\nThe WikiLeaks e-mails show the Department of Justice fed information, did you see this? to the Clinton campaign.\nSo think of this. The Department of Justice, you remember that whole deal with Wild Bill getting on the back of an airplane, just happened to be in Arizona.\nHe was gonna play golf. It was 110 degrees.\nBut he gets on the back of the airplane to meet with the Attorney General to talk about his golf game and to talk about his grandkids. He was there for 39 minutes. [booing]\nI think most of us know what happened. [booing]\nSo fed information, Department of Justice fed information think of this to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. Now, did you ever hear [booing]\nDid you ever hear anything like this? [booing]\nAnd, and by the way, these dishonest people, mainstream media, they don't talk about this. They don't talk about this. Now, if I sneeze if Donald Trump sneezes today, it's a major story. [applause]\nHere you have Department of Justice coming to see them to brief them prior to their interview. Folks, this is out of control.\nAnd the FBI unbelievable people. You have incredible people in the FBI. I would be willing to be that they are so ashamed of what's happened at the upper level.\nI would be willing to bet that they don't even sleep at night.\nThese are great people. These are great Americans. And they can't believe what's going on.\nThis corruption and collision is just one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. [applause]\nOur country has never been so low. In addition to a special prosecutor to look into what happened and all of the corruption, and all of the we'll say so called crime.\nBut look, when somebody deletes 33,000 e-mails after getting a subpoena. But we have to also remember this remember this. This is maybe in a sense even more important.\nWe have to investigate the investigation. [applause]\nWe have to investigate the investigation. [applause]\nWe've never had a case like this. And even Congress, you know, is sort of they've never had this before, because there's no event like this that ever took place.\nNormally, Congress you know she lied to Congress. She lied to the FBI. And remember, he said she was negligent. She was all the things you needed to be, but she lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she lied to everybody she even lied in the debates about the gold standard, right.\nRemember, she said, I never said gold standard. And remember when I said line in the sand? She said, I wasn't secretary of state. I said, I think you were, but let's see even the press said she was secretary of state, so she lied about that.\nBut think of this. Think of this. There's never been a time like this in our country. And Congress, in all fairness and I'm so disappointed in them. I am so disappointed in Congress. I am so disappointed. [applause]\nAnd I mean both sides. I'm not talking Republican Dem I'm talking everybody. To allow a thing like this to go this is crime at the highest level. She shouldn't be allowed to run for president. You know that. [applause]\nOther people's lives have been ruined, destroyed, for doing a tiny fraction of what she did. You saw the man with the book, he had to give back all the royalties and went through hell. You saw the man with the picture of the submarine, his mother goes around, she's devastated, devastated. Took pictures of a submarine. And you take a look at this.\nSo we have to investigate the investigation, and Congress but I speak to Congressmen. They don't know what to do. Because normally, they vote and they hand it over to the FBI and the Justice Department. But the FBI and the Justice Department won't do anything, so they don't know what to do. [booing]\nNow, they do make laws. Maybe they have to make up a law for a case like this. But they take these criminal acts, in my opinion, criminal acts, hand them over to the FBI, the FBI actually acknowledge that even, frankly, could have gone that speech could have been 10 times longer.\nBut all of these things yes, she did this, yes, she did this, yes, she did that, yes, she did that, but we're not going to do anything, right but what do you do when you hand them over to the FBI and the Justice Department and that's the end of it? We have never been in a position like this.\nI'm so embarrassed by what's taken place, and I'm very, very disappointed in Congress because our people, our politicians I don't know, do they make a deal where everybody protects each other in Washington? Maybe that's it. I really believe it. I really believe it. I almost say, listen, we're going to leave you alone, but when it's our turn, you have to leave them alone. Do they make deals like this?\nThis is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I've ever seen involving justice in the United States in the history of the United States. We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency, and she has the Justice Department, where she essentially told the AG in the speech or a talk that she'd appoint her AG again. And this is the person that's supposed to be ruling?\nFolks, whether I win, lose, or draw, I'm ashamed of what's happened to our country and so are you. [applause]\nHillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails. And did you see, two days ago, boxes of e-mails and other things were missing? They were missing.\nSo she deleted 33,000 e-mails and bleached them. By the way, nobody bleaches; nobody I have people that are sophisticated in this world. They never even heard of it. They called it acid wash, meaning you can never retrieve them, although I have a feeling that the NSA has them. They don't want them. They don't want to get them. I have a feeling. [applause]\nSo then she did this after, not before. Before would be bad. She did this after getting a congressional subpoena.\nNow, if your friend is suing you in a regular lawsuit, and you do that, you go to jail. Here's the United States Congress subpoenas her e-mails and other things, and she deletes the e-mails, saying there are 33,000 e-mails remember? for the wedding and for yoga classes 33,000 e-mails. [applause]\nAnd then and then after all of that, now they're missing two boxes of perhaps the most important of the group.\nAnd what about her law firm? You know what? She's using a phenomenal law firm. I know the firm. Phenomenal law firm. They're the ones that did all this stuff. Remember, they said we made a ruling they were work-related. You can't do that. If they're work- related, what you do is you show them you show them and you get them. It's a law firm nobody ever mentions. The law firm is unbelievable. It's very powerful. OK?\nObviously, they've done a great job. But that law firm should be implicated in this crime. OK? [applause]\nThey're the ones they got rid of all this stuff. The law firm got rid of all this stuff. And they should be implicated because they have committed a crime. They are not supposed to say, \"Oh, we got rid of most of it.\" That law firm that I know very well, as I said total professionals, total insiders they got rid of 33,000 and much more than that. It is one of the great miscarriages of justice.\nSo then she destroyed her phones, some with a hammer, to cover up her crimes. Now, how many of you people have gotten rid of cell phones and you start whacking them with a hammer? Has any please raise your hand? Please. One. What business are you in?\nI see two hands. We have 15,000. Two hands. Anybody else? It is so disgraceful. It's so embarrassing. And by the way, we're going to go over some of the WikiLeaks stuff. The press hardly reports it. They hardly report it. She did a big number of Catholics, horrible number on Catholics. She did a horrible number on evangelicals through her people.\nAnd they hardly report it. While she was secretary of state, she lost or disappeared almost $6 billion. Does anyone know that? No. How do you lose $6 billion? Even Chelsea Clinton in the WikiLeaks emails expressed, quote, \"serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.\"\nAmericans have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption. It's corruption Whitewater, cattle. [applause]\nNever is with these people. Remember years ago most of you are too young to remember. Remember the cattle? She bought some cattle and she had the greatest return, like almost in the history of cattle deals? And some of these professional cattlemen and cattle women they say, boy, she's really good at this stuff. They'd been doing it all their lives, they had never had a return like that. It's corruption, folks. It's corruption.\nThey understood that, by the way. They're smart, they got it very quickly.\nThis will finally be the year the American people say, enough is enough. During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti, and you see what's going on in Haiti, it's a horrible thing. And you see what's going on with Clinton, it's a horrible thing. These are not fans of Clinton. That, I can tell you.\nThey despise the Clintons for what they did to the Haitian people. New e-mails revealed by ABC News just yesterday show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. They kept cashing in.\nAs people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of Bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment, while those who were not special friends would be put permanently on the sidelines.\nAnd remember this. Hillary's brother, running a gold mine, put on the gold Tony, you saw Tony. Tony. Anybody want to hire Tony? He's put on the board of a big gold mine company, having to do with Haiti. It's so bad.\nLook, we're in a rigged system, folks. This is a rigged, rigged system. You saw so many of the things. I'll tell you, this WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart you got to read it. And you got to maybe get it, because they're not putting it out. They want to put it out, but they can't do that, because without the media and without the press, Hillary Clinton would be nothing. She'd be nothing. Zero. [applause]\nAnd by the way, did everybody see the debate the other day, yes? [applause]\nSo they had nine online polls. Some of them had us 90 to 10, 80 to 20. \"Time Magazine\" had like a massive look, \"Time Magazine\" is no friend of mine except they put me on the cover so much. Not because they like me, because they like selling magazines.\nBut \"Time Magazine\" it was total destruction. And then the next morning, she walks in and says, did everybody see the debate? People go, yes, yes. Did we beat her or what? I look so forward[applause]\nI do. I look so forward to the next one in Las Vegas.\nAs Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time. To all our friends in Little Haiti they're great people. I mean, I spent a long time these are people that are incredible. They have the warmest feeling, the warmest heart. But to all of our friends in Little Haiti, your day of justice is coming, believe me. [applause]\nAnd it arrives on November 8. November 8, get out and vote.\nThe new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals. They attacked Catholics and evangelicals. [booing]\nViciously. [booing]\nAnd that won't be tolerated but it won't be tolerated by the voters. Tell you what anybody of religion I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you. I really do believe it. [applause]\nAnd in all of the primaries you saw that. I wasn't expected to win with evangelicals but once we got started and once they heard my message as opposed to other people's messages we really we won big with evangelicals. They're incredible people. [applause]\nRemember the Johnson Amendment. We're gonna get rid of that Johnson Amendment. Just remember that. [applause]\nThese emails are just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has for everyday faithful Americans. True. The Wikileaks email show that Hillary Clinton's staff, even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile. Smile Hillary. Smile. [applause]\nHey folks, we have to get back to work. Our country's in trouble. We can't play games anymore. Smile. You believe it? Smile. [applause]\nAnd how about where it said to the public you say this, but to the others that give you the money you say that. I'll tell you. It's so revealing somebody's going to do a great book on that, because the press just did not little tiny stories, big, big things. Getting answers for debates and questions for debates, before the debate takes place. How about that?\nI'll tell you what. Can you imagine me, if any of this stuff pertained to me? Front page headlines all over the world, Donald Trump oh well, we've been there and we seem to be doing really well.\nHillary Clinton, commonly referred to as Crooked Hillary, thinks that you all of you are deplorable and totally irredeemable. [applause]\nI actually think irredeemable is worse, I don't know. I'm the only one. Deplorable and irredeemable. Irredeemable meaning, meaning you can never, ever come back. I call you hard-working American patriots, and together we are going to save this country and we are going to make America great again. [applause]\nAnd it's hot as hell in here but I don't care. [applause]\nCall it Florida, right? Florida. [applause]\nEmails also show that the DNC vice-chair was feeding information so much information to the candidate. Oh man, I want that why can't the Republicans do that? Why can't Reince feed me information prior to a debate. I'm so angry at the Republicans I want to be fed information like Hillary gets. [applause]\nAnd we still beat her badly, right? So I mean what's the big deal? But I want information. The Republicans are not doing their job. They should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debate.\nThis all comes after a secret tape that shows Hillary Clinton calling Bernie voters now look Bernie I feel sorry for Bernie.\nHe made a deal with the devil and he blew his reputation. But she called Bernie voters basement dwellers.\nSo all of the Bernie votes out there, join our movement, like all of these young people. We're going to fix our trade deals and get special interests out of government.\nAnd by the way, by the time this ends, I'll have over a hundred million dollars of my money in this thing, right, which means that's $100 million of people that don't have to give me money and say, Donald, will you do this, will you do that, will you do that? [applause]\nThat's a lot of money. [applause]\nAnd I asked her the other night, I said, you know, I will have over a hundred million and that's a lot of money. If I lose, I'm going to be so angry at Florida. [laughter]\nI'll still love you, I think. Maybe not. [applause]\nYou know, one of the pundits said, and you've heard me say this maybe, but they said, Mr. Trump, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. You have done the single greatest job. nobody's ever done a thing like this before. No matter where we go it's like this. But... [applause]\nThey said it's the single Bill O'Reilly said it, but many peoples said, it's the single greatest political phenomena they've ever seen. I said, wait a minute, you're wrong.\nIf I don't win on November 8th, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy and money of anything I've ever done, because we're not going to be able to reduce your taxes, we're not going to be able to save your Second Amendment, appoint Supreme Court judges, take care of you vets, fix up your depleted, very depleted the greatest people on earth but our military is so depleted.\nWe're going to take care of a lot of things, including getting the drugs out. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions. What a mess did she do does she go down as the all-time worst?\nMore Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals. And as WikiLeaks showed, she wants to cut your Medicare and Social Security benefits. You didn't see that. [booing]\nSee? And I'm not going to. The press doesn't report that she wants to cut your Social Security. And she wants to cut Medicare and one of the big advantages of me having a rather large microphone, meaning a lot of people are listening, is that I can talk about WikiLeaks and look it's on al the television networks live. We're live. [applause]\nAmazing. [applause]\nI think they are just turning them all off now. Watch. You go home, they'll say, why did it end so abruptly?\nA vote for Trump is a vote for America first and it's a vote to protect Medicare and Social Security and lower your taxes. [applause]\nBig, big tax decrease. We're going to lower your taxes. WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning about for a very, very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. [booing]\nIt's one of the biggest ways that our system is rigged. And I was the first one to use that term when I was running in the primaries when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than people that I beat easily.\nAnd my people said, oh no, that's the way the system I say, well then the system's wrong! How do you win a state and you get less delegates?\nAnd I said, this system is rigged! And it was, but we figured out how to win, right? That's what you need. [applause]\nWon in a landslide. I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party in the primaries system [applause]\nBy far. Wasn't even close. [applause]\nReporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they're actually cogs for a corrupt political machine. That's the Clinton machine. The e-mail show the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Univision who I sued I sued Univision, and I was very happy with what they did. [booing]\nAnd this lightweight, you know John Hardwood, this lightweight. This guy who came out, he was shaking. He was so nervous.\nHe asked me the first question, \"Mr. Trump, could you answer this question?\" What a lightweight. They shoulda fired him for what he did.\nJohn Harwood. I hate to make him famous but 'cause nobody ever heard of him before, but a total lightweight of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons.\nAnd reporters smothering the Clintons with praise. The New York Times even gave Clinton a call to give her a veto power over her quotes in a story that was already written. Nobody ever called me and said, \"Hi, Mr. Trump. We wrote a story. Would you read the story and please give us a little feedback. Would you like us to take anything out?\"\nThis system is so rigged. Now, this is all down in the e-mails. She had veto power over what she said.\nI'll tell you what. I want to have that, too. I want to have veto power.\nI used to get such good publicity, folks. Now, I mean it's like it's incredible. I used to get my life was so simple.\nMy life was so simple. I had a beautiful, simple life. It was going.\nI built an unbelievable company. And then I decide to do this, and my life became slightly more complex.\nYou know, we have people in this audience right now that 18 years ago had one great job, they were making more money 18 years ago than they're making now. And now they have two and sometimes three jobs. In other words, they're older and they're working harder, and they're making less.\nNot a good not a good assemblage of facts. Here's the only good news. I'm also older and working harder than I've ever worked before.\nOK? That I can tell you. [applause]\nIncluding being in this wonderful area at 114 degrees temperature. [applause]\nWhich is great 'cause you go home and you lose weight. I mean why you can't be. You go home, you say, \"I feel great. I lost a lot of weight.\"\nBy the way, let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk, and let's see how long she lasts folks. [applause]\nOh, what a joke what a total joke. Our country's in such trouble. That's why I'm I it's just so ridiculous.\nThe corporate media can't report on the establishment because the corporate media is the establishment, such a big part of it. We're going to break up the special interest monopoly, and we're going to win this country back for the American people. We're gonna do it, too. [applause]\nThe e-mails also reveal that Hillary Clinton believes in global governments, unlimited immigration unlimited, much more than Obama. From the Middle East, come right in. Come right in.\n550 percent more than President Obama, who is grossly incompetent. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing. [applause]\nAnd why is he campaigning? We just had a horrible jobs report. We have no growth. You saw GDP at one percent we have no growth. We have a horrible jobs report. China is ripping us off. Japan is ripping us off with the cars. Mexico has a unbelievable deal with us, both on the border I mean, look at our trade deficit with Mexico. And China, and Vietnam, and everybody.\nLast year, our country had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion. $800 billion. [booing]\nWho the hell negotiates these deals? I mean, can you believe it? So I say, why the hell is Obama allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton? He's always campaigning, and he's doing his little thing, you know, having a good time. He ought to be out in the White House. He's not there long. He ought to be there working and fixing some of these horrible trade deals and bringing jobs back to our country, not campaigning for a crooked person, for a totally dishonest and crooked person. [applause]\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said, my dream is a hemispheric common market that's not good for your jobs with totally open trade and open borders. 600 million people could pour into the United States. You'll have nothing left.\nTell you, if that happens, I know the real estate here, I love the real estate here sell fast. Behind closed doors, when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. This all came out. She said she wants to dissolve the borders. And here I am saying, we want strong borders. We don't want drugs coming in. We don't want crime coming in. I don't know, maybe I'm wasting my time. Am I wasting my time? I don't think so. [applause]\nShe doesn't want to have any borders. Total amnesty tell you what, folks. This is the last time you'll ever have a chance to save our country. It's not going to happen. You won't be able to. The numbers will be too great. Already, the Republican nominee has a massive disadvantage, and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people. They're not putting their weight behind the people[booing]\nInstead of calling me and saying, congratulations, you did a great job. You absolutely destroyed her in the debate, like everybody said you know, Pat Buchanan wrote the big article today, you saw it\u2014I'm not bragging, I'm just saying\u2014maybe a little bit, but here\u2014he said it was the single greatest debate performance in the history of presidential politics. [applause]\nSo wouldn't you think that Paul Ryan would call and say, good going? In front of just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. So you know, you'd think that they'd say, great going, Don. Let's go, let's beat this crook. She's a crook. Let's beat her. We got to stop it. No, he doesn't do that.\nThere's a whole deal going on there. I mean, you know, there's a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But there's a whole sinister deal going on.\nCrooked Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us. Our great founders are spinning in their graves. Our founders are spinning in their graves like Douglas MacArthur, like George Patton, like our generals. They're spinning in their grave and by the way, General Flynn and all the generals - over 200 admirals and generals have endorsed Donald Trump.\nTwo hundred. Over 200. [applause]\nTwenty-one congressional Medal of Honor recipients have endorsed Donald Trump. I'll tell you, you know what I like? Very smart, tough people like me. I like that. The smart, tough people, they like Trump.\nAmerican soldiers have fought and died to win and keep America's freedom and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to open borders, open trade, and world government. And I do believe in free trade but I believe more in smart trade.\nWe're going to make great deals with other countries. We're going to bring jobs back. We're going to bring jobs back. [applause]\nI'm not running to be president of the world. I'm running to be president of the United States of America. [applause]\nOh, I wish those cameras would turn so some time our friends back in New York and back in Pennsylvania and back in Ohio and all these different states, they could see the crowds but they do hear it. You know, when you hear the noise, they say they never show the crowd but you hear the crowd. You can't imitate that noise. [applause]\nWe will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the United States. It's going to be America first, America first, America first. [applause]\nAnd yesterday, Hillary had Al Gore - climate change. Now, I want - just so you know - do you know that I've won numerous environmental awards? I'm a believer in the environment. It's got to be within reason. I'm a believer. Here's what I want, though. I want immaculately clean water and I want immaculately clean air. That's what I want. That's called climate change. That's called environmental protection [applause]\nBut Hillary had this deal. Very, very lightly attended and I watched on television as they said this is the largest crowd that she's had. You know what she's got? Like a tiny little fraction. Now, they're not going to say look at the crowd with crooked Hillary yesterday. She had Al Gore get up, this poor guy. [booing]\nI don't know what the hell happened to him. What happened to him? She had Al Gore get up, because don't forget, Obama thinks that climate change is the single biggest and most dangerous problem for the world today. [booing]\nNot nuclear weapons in the hands of maniacs or in the hands of countries that hate us. No, no that's no problem. Climate change is our problem. I'll tell you how this going, how we're doing folks. If we don't win this election, I don't know what I'm going to do. [applause]\nI don't know. No, no can you imagine? Here's a guy where we have ISIS that he essentially founded, if you look. Remember I said, founded and he's going to get the medal for having\u2014and I kiddingly. But it's really not that kiddingly but then they put it on Mo Bisely, he found and I says, let me tell you something. When they pulled out of Iraq the way they\u2014we should have never been in Iraq and I was against it and they know it.\nBut we should have never been in Iraq. But when we were, the way he pulled out, he announced when he's leaving, he pulled out everybody instead of leaving, groups behind. And they created a vacuum and ISIS was formed. Now think of this because the biggest thing that came out of the debate in my opinion, and it really came out of the first debate, which if I didn't have fixed microphone or a broken microphone, nobody's been able to tell me, but I watched.\nCouldn't talk very good because my mike didn't work. But I watched and I said you know, it's interesting. Hillary said she's going to do this and this and this but she's been there for 30 years, she never did it. [applause]\nAnd I said to her in the second debate, I said let me ask you a question. Let me\u2014and by the way, you know that so-called Commission on Presidential Debates, the head guy used to work for Bill Clinton. Did you know that? I just found that out. The head guy worked for Bill Clinton. What a rigged deal this is. But here's the story. I have no respect for that group by the way, I have none. It sounds good. Presidential commission, give me a break. [applause]\nThat's why I was so happy what we did to annihilate the enemy the other day. So happy. [applause]\nBecause we're dealing against a very dishonest system. But Hillary, so important, wants to have a radical, and this is very radical, immigration. She wants to radicalize immigration where you have people pouring in. Remember this, the border patrol agents, 16,500 gave me their endorsement. Last week, ICE, ICE, these are great people, you don't hear great things because they're not allowed to do their job.\nThese are people that frankly, would work a lot less. I mean their job's easier if Hillary wins because basically all they have to do is stand there and watch people walk in front of them. ICE, these are great people. Tough people, smart people. First time in their history they endorse me, they've got to work harder, and they endorse me. [applause]\nAnd one of the things they told me that I thought was terrible is that she refused when she was secretary of state to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens. In other words, we have somebody in from a foreign country illegally. The person kills somebody, hurts somebody, robs a store, robs a bank, does all sorts\u2014sells drugs all over the place, poisons our youth. And we want to send them back to the country from which they came and they bring them back and the country says, we're not taking them.\nBecause they're smart. They don't want them. So they bring them back into the United States and put him into our society. I guarantee you, and you can mark my words, and there's a lot of tape running, that won't happen once when Donald Trump is president; not once, guarantee you that. [applause]\nOne convicted criminal alien, she allowed to go free\u2014totally free; killed a young girl named Casey Chadwick; beautiful young girl. The corrupt establishment in Washington wants to surrender America's borders, even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of other countries. She'll protect those borders, but not our borders.\nCasey Chadwick was a great example, and he was let free, and she should be alive today. Jamiel Shaw has a son\u2014had a son, a great young man, killed violently. And I don't know if you know, but killed violently by an illegal immigrant, shot three times in the face for no reason; somebody that wasn't supposed to be here.\nAnd you have\u2014you have case after case after case. We're not going to have it anymore. We're not going to be the stupid people anymore. We're not going to be the stupid, weak people anymore. [applause]\nA Trump administration will secure, control, defend and protect the borders of the United States, as sure as you are standing here today. [applause]\nWe will 100 percent build the wall, 100 percent. [applause]\nAre you ready? Are you ready? [applause]\nAnd who is going to pay for the wall?\nAudience: \"Mexico\"\n100 percent. They just don't know it yet. They don't know it yet, but 100 percent. They'll pay for the wall.\nHey, look, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico and China and all of these countries that are ripping us off and now have no respect. They're going to make less and they're going to like us more. Funny how that works, but it's true. Mexico is making a fortune with trade. They're taking our jobs. So many things. They are going to respect us finally.\nWe will stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Florida has seen a 470 percent increase in heroin deaths. Think of that\u2014think if you have a child\u2014470 percent increase in heroin deaths since 2007. Think of that. Think of your kids and your grandkids.\nWe're going to stop it. And most of it's coming across the southern border. And let me tell you, when we allow ICE and when we allow the Border Patrol agents and when we give them that big beautiful wall with a door in it so people can come in, but they have to come in legally; we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally. [applause]\nWe will stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and others. [applause]\nBut I have a message for the drug dealers, for the gang members and the criminal cartels: Your days are numbered, believe me; your days are numbered. [applause]\nHillary also wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees. We don't know anything about them. [booing]\nThis, even though she admitted in private according to WikiLeaks, just out, that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate\u2014she knows it\u2014they're trying to infiltrate our refugee program. So she said it just yesterday that she knows they're trying to come in through that method, and yet she wants 550 percent more than even Obama's staggeringly high numbers, thousands and thousands.\nWe can't let it happen. And we all have a heart, and we'll build safe havens and we'll have the Gulf States pay because they're not doing their share. Believe me, they're not. They have plenty of money, they'll pay. We can't pay. We owe $20 trillion. 20 trillion, doubled during Obama years. Doubled. He doubled the debt during his years.\nIn fact, the terrorists have already infiltrated our country. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in our 50 states. A record. Attack after attack, including the recent terror strikes in New Jersey, New York, Minnesota, as well as the mall shooting in Washington, were made possible by our extremely open immigration system that's meant only to protect fools, and we're not fools. [booing]\nSo let me state this clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]\nShe won't even use the word. She won't even use the term. Our incompetent president\u2014I call him our campaign president\u2014our incompetent president won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He won't use it. He tries to explain it. He spends hours trying to explain why. If you don't identify your problem, folks, you're never going to get rid of it. It's only getting worse.\nAnd remember, I said it before, we've started off when he became president with no ISIS. Nobody head the term ISIS, which he calls ISIL, right. You know why he does that? Because he likes disturbing all of you. He calls ISIL. But we started off, we had no ISIS. And now, 7 1\/2 years later, they're in, they think, 32 countries.\nAnd she's going to get rid of them? I can tell you this. They are hoping and they are praying\u2014they are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes president of the United States, because they'll take over not only that part of the world. They'll take over this country, they'll take over this part of the world, believe me. They are hoping.\nAnd by the way, she likes to say, they want me\u2014I will be their worst nightmare. I'm going to be their worst nightmare. [applause]\nAnd she lied during the debate. Remember when I said the red line in the sand, right? She said, I wasn't secretary of state then, all flustered, all crazy. She was there when they drew the line. I walked out, they said, you know, she was there. Oh, well, she sort of said she wasn't. She was there.\nIt turned out to be a lie. And even the media said that they hated - she lied about that. She lied about many things.\nShe put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons. You know, this horrible Iran deal where they gave $400 million in cash, but it turned out to be $1.7 billion in cash. You couldn't fit that in the back of this arena, that's how much money it is.\nShe gave - they gave that much money to the terrorists, to our enemies. And by the way, our enemies aren't even nice to us. Now they're emboldened.\nYou see the little boats going around our beautiful ships doing all sorts of little things to drive our people crazy. Folks, they're not gonna do that stuff when I'm president, I guarantee ya. [applause]\nYou see the way they captured our ten sailors 'cause they were a little bit in the wrong waters. And instead of saying nicely, \"Hey, listen. You gotta be over there a little bit\", they humiliated the sailors, humiliated their families, and humiliated our country, right.\nAnd the only reason they let 'em go is that our payments of $150 billion started the next day. So stupid they're not.\nAnd when they fly - they - they flew right alongside of our - our planes the other. You saw that? Their jet fighters.\nRight, you saw that? And when Putin is buzzing - you know Hillary's tough with Russia.\nYou ever notice anything that goes wrong, they blame Russia. Russia did it. They have no idea. We're being hacked because we have people that don't know what they're doing.\nThey have people. But they always blame Russia and then they say, \"Donald Trump is friends with Putin.\"\nI don't know Putin, folks. I promise. I don't know Putin.\nWhat the hell do I have to do with Putin? These people are professional con people. They're con.\nAnd this country can't have it. This country can't have it. And - and by the way, Russia, which is buzzing our ships, right.\nYou know, tough Hillary, tough Obama, they're buzzing. You saw that two weeks ago, buzzing, planes going by. They took over - yeah, they took over.\nYou look at Ukraine. They took over during - that was Crimea. They took that over during Obama's reign.\nYou know, tough Obama. He's so tough. He's so tough.\nSo, look, we need competence and we need it fast. Hillary Clinton who turned Libya into a nightmare.\nHow about Libya? How about Benghazi? How about - how about Benghazi where Ambassador Stevens sent 600 different messages to Hillary Clinton, and she didn't even respond.\nThe only one she spoke to was that sleaze Sidney Blumenthal, her friend who Obama told her you cannot deal with, and she did behind Obama's back. [booing]\nA Trump Administration will stop the reckless interventions, and instead focus on defeating and totally destroying ISIS. We're also going to build up our cyber defenses. Cyber's a big thing.\nAnd keep our power grid and our vital infrastructure modern and safe. And the word \"keep\" is an incorrect word because we have to rebuild it. It's a mess. Show Less Text\nIt's so old, it's falling apart. And we're going to use cyber offense to disrupt the enemy where we need to and keep them from recruiting online.\nISIS is taking our children, and taking our kids out of our country because they're using the internet better than we know how to use it. And we're the ones that came up with it.\nAt the same time, we're going to completely rebuild our very depleted military. We're going to take care of our people. [applause]\nAnd that includes building state-of-the-art systems of all kind. When it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in three very important words: peace through strength. We don't want to use the military. [applause]\nBut it's got to be there. [applause]\nAnd just in closing, to be strong, our country has to be rich again. We're a debtor nation. We're poor. I'm going to make America rich again. [applause]\nMy enemy\u2014our enemies are unbelievable. They love what's happening to our country. They love it. Our energy proposals won't lock the $50 trillion in energy reserves right here in America under our feet.\nThis means new jobs in Florida and many, many other communities. Pennsylvania, Ohio, we're going to take care of our miners, we're going to take care of our steelworkers, we're going to take care of natural gas. We're going to have clean coal. We're going to also have all forms of advanced energy.\nWe also have to repeal and replace it. We will do this and it's so important because it's driving everybody and small businesses and big businesses and our country out of business. Repeal and replace Obamacare. [applause]\nBill Clinton, in a rare moment of truth-telling, said last week Obamacare was a crazy system where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. What kind of a system is this?\nOh, did he suffer that evening. He went home aye yai yai, poor Bill. He suffered. You see, the next he came back and he said he was only kidding. He was only kidding. It's a disaster.\nObamacare - you know, your rates are going up 68 percent. In Texas they had 71 percent. In other communities they're going to go 95 percent and 100 percent, and next year is going to be worse. We have no choice but to absolutely repeal, replace Obamacare we're going to come up with a much better plan for much less money. [applause]\nAs you know also, most counties in the state will only have one insurer to choose from. Obama does that because that way they have a monopoly so they can charge you whatever the hell they want.\nThis is our chance to stop the abusive and horrible and\u2014and something that doesn't work, Obamacare, and save American healthcare, but you have to get out and vote.\nAt the center of our economic revival, we'll be fixing our terrible trade deals. When I announced, seems like a long time now, June 16th coming down with Melania at the escalator, remember, in Trump Tower, was an amazing - that was an amazing thing and we announced that it was a big part.\nAnd then I came out and I said Florida and our countries, we have all of these lost jobs. All of our lost manufacturing. We're going to get it back. We're bringing our jobs back.\nWhen countries come in and think they're going to steal our companies and our companies are going to go out and fire all of their employees in Florida, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in all of these countries. All of these\u2014everyone. We are not going to allow it to happen. We are not going to allow it.\nWe are going to tell it, you are going to have consequences. The states are not going to put up with it anymore. Our federal government is going to help.\nWe've built other countries at our expense. We have. So, if they come in like they did in Indiana - where Mike Pence, by the way, is doing a great job. [applause]\nAnd they take - in the case, they take - Mexico takes care of your air conditioner, and they fire their 1,400 people who were so great to me.\nAnd they think they're going to make air conditioners in their beautiful new plant in Mexico, and sell them across the border and make lots of money, and we have all the employment. Not going to happen. We're going to put a 35 percent tax on and they're staying in the United States [applause]\nAnd if they don't, we're going to make plenty of money. [applause]\nWe are going to rebuild our country. Our country is going to be a country where you can be proud of again. We're going to use American steel, we're going to use American labor, we are going to come first in all deals.\nWe're not going to make the trade deal where we come in fifth and sixth and seventh and other countries laugh at our stupidity. We are going to build great companies. We are going to expand companies that are now doing poorly. We are going to make our country very rich again.\nWe are going to make our country very safe again. [applause]\nWe are going to make America strong again. And we are going to make America great again. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\n","72":"\nThe Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election. This election will determine whether we remain a free country, or we become a corrupt Banana Republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments.\nThe election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country.\nToday we learned the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation, so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. This is collusion and corruption of the highest order, and is one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. We have to investigate the investigation.\nHillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena \u2013 and then destroyed her phones with a hammer \u2013 all to cover-up her crimes. People have gone to jail for doing far less. She also lost as much as $6 billion taxpayer dollars.\nThese Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty. This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations.\n...\nEven Chelsea Clinton, the WikiLeaks emails show, expressed \"serious concerns\" about conflicts of interests at the Clinton Foundation and State Department.\nDuring a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti. The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country. I also learned from them, firsthand, how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti.\nNew emails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from \"Friends of Bill\" or \"William Jefferson Clinton VIPs\" so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatment.\nPeople who were labeled \"Not Friends of Bill\" were placed on the sidelines.\nIn their biggest project, the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S. taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop. And guess who set it up? Cheryl Mills, Hillary's Chief of Staff who helped destroy her emails, and then got an immunity deal from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer.\nThe company that benefitted from Mills' actions then invested in a company owned by Cheryl Mills.\nToday, as Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti last time.\nTo all of our friends in Haiti, your day of justice is coming, and it arrives on November 8th.\nNot only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti, but the new emails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics. This is deeply offensive. It's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton Campaign has for everyday Americans. We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, secret service, and others in uniform. She even smeared all of America's police officers as essentially racist.\nI'm proud of the fact that I have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel.\nThe WikiLeaks emails show that Hillary's staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile.\nThe emails also show, yet again, that the DNC rigged the Democratic election to give it to Hillary Clinton. The DNC Vice Chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders' plans to the Clinton Campaign.\nTo all the Bernie voters out there: don't vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, more Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals, and \u2013 as confirmed by Wikileaks \u2013 she also wants to cut Medicare and Social Security.\n...\nWikileaks also shows something I have been warning about for a very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. It's just one more way the system is rigged.\nReporters who work for these outlets \u2013 like the Washington Post, or the New York Times \u2013 may think of themselves as journalists, but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machine.\nThe emails show the New York Times, Boston Globe, Univision and Jon Harwood of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons, and smother the Clintons with praise. The NYT even gave Clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories. It's called corruption.\nThe emails also show that the Hillary was given the CNN townhall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders. Dona Brazile, the DNC Vice Chair, emailed: \"from time to time I get the questions in advance.\"\nThe media can't report on the establishment because the media is the establishment. And they're all teamed up against you, the American people.\n...\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nWe are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders, on trade, on foreign policy, on the economy, and so much more. We are going to replace the failed leadership in Washington who have betrayed you, squandered our wealth, and sold our country.\nI am asking all Americans \u2013 Republicans, Independents and Democrats \u2013 to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation \u2013 and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe will make America wealthy again.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we are going to make America great again.\n","73":"\n\"Hello, Miami Dade College! It is so great to be here with all of you.\nAnd I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular, I want to thank all of the elected officials. Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida. Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach. Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami. Thanks to all the others who were part of the program. As we were coming in, we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd, and I was told as I was coming out, there's an overflow, but they can hear us in the overflow, and we're so happy you're here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd. But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the world's most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore.\nAbout a decade ago, Al made a movie called 'An Inconvenient Truth.' Now, maybe some of you have seen it, but if you haven't, I hope you'll watch it tonight. It doesn't have a lot of special effects \u2013 but it does have a lot of drama.\nAnd here's the main message: climate change is real, it's urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it. Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions. We can transform our economy. We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution. And above all, we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren.\nNow, let me just say \u2013 so, so let's remember, let's remember what's at stake. I'm running against a guy who denies science, denies climate change, claims it's a hoax created by the Chinese. So this is something that Al Gore's been working on for a really long time. And I want you to know how far back he goes. It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen. And then when Al became a senator, he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions, and as vice president, he led America's efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions. You take all this together, those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.\nI was very proud because he had been determined and persistent, and in the face of a lot of people \u2013 in public life, in business, in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science \u2013 he never wavered. And in the years since, the climate challenge has only grown more stark. And I will tell you this, it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election.\nLook at it this way. Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change, to protect our planet, to protect our health, and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy. Or in the alternative, we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk.\nSo we've really got to get this right. And if you need additional convincing, just remember what happened this week. Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country, more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti. North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week, if not longer. We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster.\nThat's why I've encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon, the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew, or to UNICEF, helping children and families on the ground in Haiti.\nNow, some will say, 'We've always had hurricanes. They've always been destructive.' And that's true. But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change. Right now, the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures \u2013 and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas. Sea levels have already risen about a foot \u2013 one foot \u2013 in much of the Southeast, which means that Matthew's storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe.\nPlus, as you know, the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes. It's become a daily reality here in Miami. You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide. The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. Sometimes, people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them.\nSo, if you need proof that climate change is real and that it's costly, there you go. So at this rate, at this rate, my friends, my friends, please. Let's focus on what's really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country, because this is what I want you to hear and understand. At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, and when kids \u2013 like that adorable young boy over there on his dad's shoulders \u2013 are grandparents, we believe that's more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk, and nationwide, it's as much as $882 billion in property at risk.\nBut there's also health consequences. Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges. And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse, which is especially bad for our children. And look at what is happening in California, a brutal five-year drought. Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year.\nAnd it's also about national security. The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our America's national security. The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia. It's the largest naval installation in the world. And because of rising sea level, the base is frequently flooded, even when it's sunny. So that's why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations, not just in Norfolk, but at all of our military bases around the world.\nSo you would think if you look at the facts, if you listen to the science, that even the most committed climate skeptic would say, 'Ok, I agree, something's happening here. We need to take it seriously.'\nBut unfortunately, there are still plenty of people \u2013 in Washington, on the campaign trail \u2013 who won't face what's happening right in front of us.\nDonald Trump, is, quote, 'not a big believer' in climate change. As I said, he said it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And in our first debate two weeks ago, he tried to deny saying that. But that tweet is still there for everyone to see.\nAnd I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida, like Miami Beach's Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these 'Sunny Day' Floods. Or maybe, he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alem\u00e1n. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner, John Elizabeth Alem\u00e1n. John Elizabeth is a Republican, but she's supporting our campaign\u2014because she knows America can't afford a candidate who doesn't accept climate science. Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security, or what about the ranchers in Colorado, or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say, 'Our lives and jobs and families are being affected \u2013 please, let's come together as a country and do something about it.'\nWe cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House. At all, that is absolutely unacceptable.\nWe need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat, creating good jobs, and yes, saving our planet.\nSo here's what I want to do.\nFirst, we need to do a lot more on clean energy. The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany, China, or us\u2014and I want it to be us. And I want you to be part of making it us.\nAnd we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs, building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines. Modernizing our electric grid. Retrofitting buildings. Building resilient, 21st century infrastructure, and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind\u2014not our cities or our small towns or our remote, rural areas.\nNow, you wouldn't know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is. He has such a dark, divisive view of America, but that doesn't tell the story about what's really going on. It's actually pretty exciting. In red states and blue states, local leaders are stepping up. Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America \u2013 union workers in Michigan, union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy. Iowa, Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind. Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie. Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America. I think that is so exciting \u2013 there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency.\nAnd in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm. That landfill was a blight and a health threat, just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood. Now, that same land will generate enough clean, renewable electricity to power 500 homes.\nSo this is what we can do. And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that. As president, I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term. And let's generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade. Let's make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third.\nAnd we can get there by investing in cutting edge research, to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies, investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, putting big partnerships together between states, cities, and rural communities.\nWe can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do. So I'm hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future. The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America. We want them manufactured in America, installed in America, and putting people to work in America.\nAnd while we do that, let's make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us. We need to invest in resilient infrastructure. Now, sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times, let's be more creative \u2013 like in New York Harbor, where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge. Sometimes we'll overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours. In Philadelphia, they're trying something else: green roofs, porous pavements, curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.\nAnd here's something we don't talk enough about. Let's make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster. Because sadly, I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy, newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital, because the electricity went off. Nurses, I love nurses \u2013 heroic, courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing. Now, here in Miami, you know how important this is. You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Children's Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason. And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience.\nAnd then finally, we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge. If we don't do it, nobody will do it. We must confront the climate challenge. There's no doubt about that. And so, let's move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves.\nWhen I was Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority. We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution. In fact, we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark \u2013 slip past the guards \u2013 it was all very cloak and dagger. But for a really important purpose, and because of that breakthrough, and a lot of patient, persistent work, and because of American leadership, 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December. It's called the Paris Agreement. And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last, best chance to solve the global, climate crisis.\nAnd what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement. He doesn't care what it would do to the planet. He doesn't care how much that would damage American leadership in the world. He doesn't care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids.\nWell, he may not care \u2013 but we do. And that's why this election is so critically important because on the ballot, it is not just my name. It's every issue we care about it's our values as a country.\nClimate change needs to be a voting issue. We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done. Please, we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses\u2014and certainly not to the White House.\nAnd if you care about climate, your Senate race is also really important, and I'll tell you why. It is unacceptable, it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change to say, 'I'm not a scientist.' Well, why doesn't he ask a scientist and then maybe then he'd understand why it is so important that he, representing Florida, be committed to climate change? That's why I hope that you'll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate.\nLook, we need leaders who can get results. It's easy to stonewall. It's not enough to protest: we need creativity, we need hard work. And when it comes to climate change, we don't have a minute to waste.\nSo, I know it's easy to get cynical\u2014especially about our politics. I get that. But this election matters more than any has in a really long time, and I believe that as strongly as I can, we've got to address this issue for our sakes, our children, our grandchildren. And it's so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference.\nAnd just look, if you will \u2013 look at the difference between your state, the Sunshine State, which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now. And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words 'climate change.' So my friends, this is a big deal in the election, and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world. And there isn't anybody \u2013 there isn't anybody who knows more, has done more, has worked harder. I know he was in Miami just last year, training and educating people to be climate change activists. I can't wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States. So please join me in welcoming our former vice president, a climate change leader and an all-around great guy, Al Gore.\"\n","74":"\n\"It is a glorious night here at the university, in Columbus, in the great state of Ohio. And I am thrilled to be here with all of you. And I want to thank Tony for his introduction. He made the greatest case against my opponent, didn't he? Thank you, Tony. And thanks to Mayor Ginther and Congresswoman Beatty and to my great friend, your former governor, and with your help, the next senator, Ted Strickland.\nAny of you see that debate last night? I'll tell you what, I'm not sure you'll ever see anything like that again. At least I hope you won't. It was such a clear display of what's at stake in this election. And I am thrilled to have the chance to talk with all of you about what we can do together, because I truly believe we are stronger together. To move our country forward.\nNow, the one thing I thought about last night and said was, as I was standing there on the stage with my opponent, was to remember what Michelle Obama had said. To paraphrase her, one of us went low and one of us went high. I want you to understand, I want to be a president for all Americans. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody. And I am honored to have support, not just from Democrats, but from independents and Republicans, because we've got to pull this country together if we're going to move into the future together, creating what we need for ourselves and our children.\nNow, I got to tell you, tomorrow is a big day in Ohio for this election because tomorrow, October 11th, is the last day to register in Ohio. And I hope every one of you will take your phones out, go to iwillvote.com, to confirm that you are registered. Because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody else's.\nWhen I think about the challenges that we're facing, I don't think any one person has all the answers. I think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity, because that makes us smarter as well as stronger.\nDonald Trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing. We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women. And last night he doubled down on his excuse, saying that, well, it's just locker room banter. You know what's happened today, which is so interesting, is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA, from Major League Baseball, from the NFL and more, have been coming forward, tweeting, they've been saying, no, that's not what happens in our locker rooms. And I just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald Trump does.\nBut it wasn't just this one video that was so disturbing, even shocking. We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign, and it's not just about women. Yes, he's insulted and demeaned women; we've seen it over and over again. But he has targeted others as well. He's disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos, Muslims and POWs, people with disabilities and immigrants. He is an equal-opportunity insulter if there ever was one.\nThat is not what we are in America. And it may be who he is, but this election is our chance to show who we are. We are better than that. We are bigger than that. And I want to send a message to every boy and girl, every man and woman in our country, indeed, to the entire world, that that is not who America is. And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever. Some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than we've had in a really long time. And the main reason is because your generation, the young people of America, are the most tolerant, open and generous generation in American history.\nYou know what's at stake, but you also know what you believe. And you don't want someone who says that he's going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will \u2013 who will keep Citizens United, one of the worst decisions ever made, that allowed dark, unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a woman's right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood. You know better than that. You are helping us move toward a more perfect union. That has been the story of America at our best. We keep widening the circle of opportunity and inviting more people in. If you're willing to do your part, you're willing to make your contribution, there is a place for you in this nation of ours.\nWe don't have to make America great. We've got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity.\nAnd please, never forget America is great because America is good, and if we deviate, if we deviate from our fundamental values \u2013 and that's indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run. He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes. He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country \u2013 a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty. This is turning the clock back, not just a few years, but centuries. The only way to rebuke this is to vote. Use the single most important, fundamental right you have as citizens of America.\nAnd when you do, I want you to know what you're voting for, because I don't want you just to vote against something. I want you to vote for something. And here's what we're going to do.\nI believe our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. As soon as I got out of law school, I said, I don't want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families. So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change, helping to get the law that enabled people, kids with disabilities, to go to school. Now, most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you weren't born, but \u2013 there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability, if you lived in a school district, there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you. And literally millions of kids were denied an education. I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say, this is wrong \u2013 in America, we're better than this. Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities.\nAnd then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place.\nSo when Donald Trump talks about what I've been doing for the last 30 years, I welcome that. I welcome it because in the 1970s, I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments. And in the 1980s, I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future, while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business. And in the 1990s, I went to the UN Conference on Women and said women's rights are human rights \u2013 while he was insulting Miss Universe, Alicia Machado. And on the day \u2013 on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice. So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years, bring it on.\nSo we've got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want. And I'm pretty clear about that. I think we want new jobs with rising incomes. And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II. And I have some specific ideas in mind. We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. They need to be upgraded and maintained and built. That is a question of competitiveness. We have to have a competitive economy. Our airports are so rundown we don't even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because we're not using the newest technology. We're not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs.\nI do want to bring advanced manufacturing. I heard Ted Strickland talking about that. I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance. There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing. I'm not interested in a race to the bottom, in competing for low-wage jobs. I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs. So let's lead in precision machining, 3D printing.\nAnd let's be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Some nation's going to have that title. I think it's either going to be Germany or China or us. It should be us. No question it should be. We're going to fight climate change. And we're going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement.\nI'm running against somebody who doesn't believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn't , who has even said he thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. Well, right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do. So maybe they think it's a hoax, but they're investing. And they're creating. And they're going to want to export. And what a shame it would be. We have innovated. We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this. And we're going to do it.\nWhen I am president, I want all of you who care about science, technology, engineering, mathematics, I want you to be part of it. And while we are growing the economy, we are going to make it fairer. We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty. And don't you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\nYou know, back in the spring, I was at a town hall in Las Vegas. And the little girl raised her hand. And I called on her. And she said to me, 'If you're elected president, does a girl president make the same as a boy president?'\nI said, \"Well, that's one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make.\" So we're going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly.\nAnd I'll tell you something else. I want to do more to promote profit-sharing. If you help to make the profits, it shouldn't all just go to the executives and the shareholders. You should be able to share in that.\nNow, there's a lot we can do. And people say, 'Well, how are you going to pay for it?' Well, I'm going to go where the money is. And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country. I have made a pledge, and you can hold me to it. I will not raise taxes on the middle class. Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share.\nNow, Donald Trump is the poster child for this. Last night he finally admitted he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years. Now, he claims that's because back in the early 1990s, he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who loses money running casinos? Really. Now, one of his supporters said, 'Well, the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didn't have to pay taxes made him a genius.' Well, I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year. But I'll tell you what. What that meant was he paid zero, zero for the military, zero for our vets, zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college.\nAnd then he did something that, in retrospect, seemed both odd and not very smart. He brought in Warren Buffett. He said, 'Well, everybody does this. Warren Buffett does this.'\nSo Warren Buffett, who, by the way, is a real billionaire, Warren Buffett, heard that, pretty hard to miss. And so he put out a statement today. And here's what he said. He said, 'I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13.' He said, 'I have copies of all 72 of my returns. And none uses a carryforward.' That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share. And then Warren Buffett ends by saying, 'Finally, I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit.' 'Neither would Mr. Trump. At least he would have no legal problem in doing so.' Well, if you take a shot at Warren Buffett, you'd better be prepared.\nAnd in fact, Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more. He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him. And he has proposed what's called the Buffett rule, and I am absolutely behind that, and I've said that's one of the changes I want \u2013 so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share.\nNow, there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe. And so, don't. But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer. You know, he's not usually tongue-tied, but he had no answer when confronted about the report that he's been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs. Now, I know you've seen reports and you've probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies. He's had a lot of them across Ohio. He claims to be on the side of workers. He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers. He even had the nerve \u2013 this is what kills me about him \u2013 he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. And the whole time he was hiding the truth. Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel.\nYou know, when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price, and people like Trump buy it, that kills jobs. It kills jobs in this state, including right here in Columbus. This May, Columbus Castings, the biggest single-site foundry in America, just seven miles from where we are tonight, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off. Now, when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people, it really \u2013 it really gets me upset. There's no justification for it. But it fits him to a T. For all his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits and ties were made in Mexico and China. They could have been made right here in Ohio. In fact, he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York.\nSo we've got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing. And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country, investment in workers, investment in plant and equipment, investment in research and development, and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others.\nWe are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms. We're going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed, the Dodd-Frank rules. Trump wants to do away with those. He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers. He wants to do away with that. And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class.\nWell, we're going to crack down on corporate fraud, like we've seen at Wells Fargo. We're going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again. And we're going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America. If they try to leave, we're going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America.\nWe're also going to end the carried interest loophole. I've been trying to get that done for years. We're going to get it done. We've got a couple of different ways of doing it. I hope that Congress along with us, but if they don't, we're going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code, hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate, not for investing but just for moving money around. That's going to end. I want to reward the productive economy. I don't want to keep rewarding the financial economy. That is not the way we're going to grow new businesses, and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans.\nNow, people in Ohio often ask about, 'Well, what are we going to do about trade?' Well, we're going to have smart and fair trade. That's what I love about your Senator, Sherrod Brown. He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have. Look. We've got to trade with the rest of the world. We're only 5 percent of the population of the world. We've got to trade with the other 95 percent. When I was Secretary of State, we really bore down on this, and we increased American exports 30 percent, and in particular, 50 percent to China, because we stood behind every American business. We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell.\nAnd I've gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade. They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal. So we're going to stand up. I'm going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal we're already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us.\nAnd I've always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs? Does it raise American incomes? is it good for our national security? And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, it fails my tests. Once it was finally negotiated, I don't think it will do what I want it to do, so I oppose it. I oppose TPP now. I'll oppose it after the election. I'll oppose it as president. But I'm going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world.\nI also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security. And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about, but I'll tell you what. I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security. That is off the table forever.\nSo let's say yes to good jobs, but here's what else we need to say yes to. Let's say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university. I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well. And for a lot of kids, they're not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade. There's an achievement gap already. There's also a digital gap; we have five million homes, mostly poor homes, without access to the internet, so they're behind. I want this to be a true meritocracy. I'm tired of inequality. I want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it.\nSo I want to have universal pre-kindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful. I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education. And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school. We need technical education for more young people. Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college, but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful. I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses. We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers, for coders, for all kinds of skills.\nAnd then when it comes to college, I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself. We both remember that college was affordable. And it isn't for a lot of people now, and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities. So here is our proposal.\nWe want anyone from a family that makes less than $125,000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free. And for families over that line, we want you to go debt-free. So yes, you pay what you can afford, but you don't have to go into debt to go to Ohio State. And I'll tell you, the other big problem \u2013 how many of you already have student debt? Oh, wow. Practically every hand. Well, here's what we're going to do. We're going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt. If you can refinance your home mortgage, your car payment, or if Donald can refinance his airplane, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt.\nAnd then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make, and have a limit on that, 10 percent, so that \u2013 I feel personally about this because that's what I did after law school. My dad was a small businessman, and he really was a saver. He didn't even have a credit card. Didn't believe in that. So he saved the money for me to go to college. I had to work if I wanted to buy a book, but that was okay. That was the arrangement. And then I told him I wanted to go to law school. He said, 'You're on your own. I don't have any money for that.' So I worked, I got a small scholarship, and I took out loans. But boy, was I lucky, because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs. In other words, when I got out of law school, I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund and make, I don't know, $14,000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income, not on an interest rate of 8, 10, 12 percent like I see from young people across America.\nSo that's what I want, but I also want to make it possible, if you do public service or national service, to have a lot of your loan, and maybe all of it, forgiven because you're going to be paying back to our country. And I've got this idea about something I'm calling the National Service Reserve. It's kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve. You get the training and you're kind of on call and you practice and train. And then if you're needed, you're called up. I want a civilian national reserve, and I want people of all ages in it. And we would train you so that if there's a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with, we could call you up to go do that. And it's a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because that's how we build solidarity. That's how we get to know each other better.\nSo I'm pretty excited about what we're going to do together. And I can't do any of this without your help. I really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure you're registered, to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure they're registered. As I said, go to iwillvote.com. You can find it out right there on that site. And we'd love to have you be involved in the campaign because I know that if we win in November, we can summon the positive spirit of our country back again. I think I have to do everything, everything in my power to bring people together, and I will.\nIt's really important to me that you know that I want to be your president whether you vote for me or not. Obviously, I hope you do, but I will be your president, and I will stand up for you, and I will work for you, and I will fight for you. So please, if you're not registered, get registered by tomorrow, and then you can start voting October 12th. And whatever issue, whatever issue you care about, imagine that that is on the ballot. Imagine if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, if you believe \u2013 if you believe that we finally should have paid family leave in this country like every other advanced economy, if you believe climate change is real and we could save our planet by creating a lot of jobs at the same time, if you believe diversity is America's strength, not a weakness, if you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that LGBT Americans should be treated equally across America, and you should be able to live up to your potential, no matter who you are or where you come from, then start voting October the 12th!\nAnd I promise you this. Together we're going to prove that we can make the future what it should be for all of you; that there is a positive, optimistic, confident America out there; that America's best days are ahead of us, not the dark and divisive vision of my opponent, but one in keeping with what I see as I travel across America \u2013 the energy, the dynamism, the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans, but particularly young Americans. So please, join this campaign. Be part of it for the next 29 days. And together we will prove that we can have the future that we want and that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you, Ohio State!\"\n","75":"\nThank you. It is great to be here in the city of Henderson, in the beautiful state of Nevada \u2013 a state where I have so many great friends and employees.\nIn 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.\nHow many of you watched the Vice Presidential Debate last night?\nMike did such an incredible job. I would argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of Vice Presidential debates.\nLast night America also got a firsthand look at my judgement and the judgement of my opponent. Our first Presidential decision was the selection of our running mates, and all of America saw that I made the right choice.\nWhile Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America, his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions.\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse \u2013 she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, producing only death and destruction \u2013 she unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria and Libya, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons.\nAt home, Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.\nShe is merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding this country dry.\nI am running to represent Americans \u2013 and we are going to make America Rich again.\nI am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.\nMy economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nThe problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.\nRight now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.\nOur infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\nThe homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.\nOur police are under-funded, under-staffed, and under-supported \u2013 and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racist.\nOur border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into the country.\nThousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare \u2013 even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.\nOur annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.\nThe federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.\nWe have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nWe are a nation divided, with race riots in the streets.\nOur college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs \u2013 or certainly not the jobs they want.\nOur allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.\nAmerica needs a turnaround.\nAmerica needs a comeback.\nAmerica needs a change.\nThat is why I am running.\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is back \u2013 bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.\nFirst, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nPresident Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\nThat was a lie.\nHe promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.\nAnother lie.\nNow, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.\nTwo days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare \"one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.\"\nBill has a different view. Here is what bill said:\nHe just said it's a \"crazy system,\" and that \"it's the craziest thing in the world.\"\nBill said:\n\"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half\u2026the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.\" Clinton added that it \"doesn't make any sense,\" and that \"the insurance model doesn't work.\"\nOn my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\nThere is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd.\nFixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival\nChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money \u2013 the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.\nWe're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.\nOur jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.\nWhen I am President, we will start making things in America again.\nOur nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA \u2013 a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal \u2013 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nAs the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.\nReal cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973.\nWe've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own. Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.\nAnd now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.\nWe are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.\nWe will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal Hillary called the \"Gold Standard.\" The backers of the deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, and their wish is her command.\nShe is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.\nI am an outsider fighting for YOU.\nWe will stop the foreign cheating, the product dumping, and the one-sided trade deals. We will lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and many small businesses will file as individuals any pay only 12 percent. On top of that, we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.\nOur tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade.\nAmerica will become the great jobs magnet of the world.\nFactories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay \u2013and new hope.\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.\nSecurity begins at the border.\nAny government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nThis includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the immigration policies of Obama-Clinton. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.\nSarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.\nThen there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.\nIn California, a 64-years old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.\nAlso in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 \u2013 he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant. The killer had 3 gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer, prior to the shooting but he had not been deported from our country.\nThere are more than 2 million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now, and more who have escaped the law entirely \u2013 when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.\nAll Americans living lawfully in this country, including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants, are entitled to have their jobs, their wages, and their security protected. The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today \u2013 and when those borders are erased, it's often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security.\nAt the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just two days ago, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9\/11.\nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country \u2013 as was the mall shooter in Washington State. Now, the media doesn't want to talk about this \u2013 they don't want to ask how our vetting procedures failed, or how immigration from high-risk parts of the world increased the chances of terrorism and violence.\nThe Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fianc\u00e9 visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\nI am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.\nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.\nHillary is for open borders.\nI am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.\nFor the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.\nWe are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. I have a simple message for the cartels, the gang members, and the drug dealers preying on our citizens \u2013 your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.\nWe are also going to end the government corruption\nHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails \u2013 after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.\nNow we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots.\nWe are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nThe Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.\nTo those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nI am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and to help their children grow up in safety and peace.\nPoor communities will see a massive infusion of new small businesses, and new high-paying jobs. I am also going to fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.\nI want to put every American child on the ladder of success: a great education, and a high-paying job.\nHere are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nThis Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nThe failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\nI am going to fight for every last citizen in this land, and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. You are voting to believe in your country.\nAll together, we are going to \u2013\nMake America wealthy again.\nWe are going to make America strong again.\nWe are going to make America safe again.\nAnd we are going to make America great again.\n","76":"\nThank you. I am so thrilled to be here in Reno\nWith your help, in 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back our jobs.\nWe are going to make America rich again.\nI am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse \u2013 it's been 30 years of failure.\nThe problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.\nRight now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.\nOur infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\nThe homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.\nHeroin overdoses are surging, and meth overdoses in Nevada are up 22 percent.\nThousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare \u2013 even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.\nOur annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.\nThe federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.\nWe have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nOn top of it all, our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.\nAmerica needs a turnaround.\nAmerica needs a comeback.\nAmerica needs a change.\nAnd that change is coming on November 8th. We are going to show the whole world that America is back \u2013 bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.\nFirst, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nPresident Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.\nTwo days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare \"one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.\"\nBill has a different view. Here is what bill said:\nHe just said it's a \"crazy system,\" and that \"it's the craziest thing in the world.\"\nBill said:\n\"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half\u2026the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.\" Clinton added that it \"doesn't make any sense,\" and that \"the insurance model doesn't work.\"\nThere is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd.\nWith your votes, you will also be voting to protect the 2ndamendment rights of every law-abiding gun-owner in Nevada. Hillary wants to effectively abolish the 2ndamendment, by overturning D.C. vs. Heller and declaring that guns are not a private right. We are also going to conserve your land and natural resources for hunters, anglers, and all who enjoy the outdoors.\nFixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nBut to bring back our jobs, we must fix our trade deals \u2013 and stand up to countries that cheat.\nChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money \u2013 the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.\nWe're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.\nOur jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.\nWhen I am President, we will start making things in America again.\nOur nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA \u2013 a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal \u2013 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nThe jobs are leaving Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, and all across this country. I'm going to stop the jobs from leaving our country \u2013 and I'm going to bring millions of new jobs back into our country.\nIt's going to be a new day in America.\nFor too long, we've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.\nSkyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.\nAnd now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.\nWe will also lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.\nThousands of new companies, millions of new jobs, and trillions of dollars in new wealth will come pouring into the United States.\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.\nSecurity begins at the border.\nHillary Clinton is unfit to be President because she supports open borders.\nIn fact, as Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldn't take them back -- it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminals.\nBut she didn't do it.\nThe ICE officers, who endorsed me \u2013 their first endorsement of a candidate ever \u2013 issued a lengthy statement on Hillary Clinton's immigration plans.\nLet me read from it.\nAgain, this all a quote from the ICE officers: \"Hillary Clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.\"\n\"Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders.\"\nTheir quote continues.\n\"She proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty, to expand catch- and-release, to expand President Obama's non-enforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays, to support Sanctuary Cities, to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants, to grant amnesty within 100 days, to extend Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty, plus a 550% increase in the admission of Syrian refugees.\"\nThe ICE officers conclude by saying: \"Her plan is total amnesty plus open borders.\"\nThat whole quote is from the nation's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers. In short, Hillary's immigration stance is disqualifying.\nThe first duty of the President of the United States is to protect the citizens of the United States \u2013 anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nation.\nThere are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now, and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely \u2013 when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.\nAt the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.\nHundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9\/11.\nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country \u2013 as was the mall shooter in Washington State.\nThe Boston Bombers were here on asylum.

I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.\nWe are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe are also going to end the government corruption\nHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails \u2013 after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.\nIt's worse than Watergate.\nHillary Clinton put her public office up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\nNow we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to show up and vote.\nWe are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nThe Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more.

I am so thrilled to be back in Arizona.\nIn 35 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nI am going to make America Rich again.\nI am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.\nMy economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nI want to send our best wishes to the great governor Mike Pence, as he prepares for his debate tonight. The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow, versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is stuck in the past. We are change \u2013 she is four more years of Obama.\nClinton can't talk about the real problems facing our country because she's the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place. To hide her corruption, she deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena.\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse \u2013 she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, unleashing death and destruction. And she failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.\nNow, after years of failure, she complains about how I've used the tax laws to my benefit. Then why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did? She could have changed those laws when she was in the Senate. The reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as I did.\nI know all their names, and I know who they are, but it's not up to me to make them public figures.\nTwo public Hillary supporters who are known are George Soros, who declared losses of $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffet who, in 2014, declared losses of $873 million.\nI know how the tax code works better than anyone, and I am going to fix it so it is fair, and just, and works for you and your family.\nI've made my money as a highly-successful private businessperson following the law. Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office.\nThe problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.\nRight now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.\nOur infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\nThe homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase in 45 years.\nOur border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country.\nThousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare \u2013 even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.\nOur annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.\nThe federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.\nWe have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nWe are nation divided, with race riots in the streets.\nOur college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs \u2013 or certainly not the jobs they want.\nOverseas, our failed leaders have empowered Iran, unleashed ISIS, and turned Iraq, Libya and Syria into absolute chaos.\nOur allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.\nAmerica needs a turnaround.\nAmerica needs a comeback.\nAmerica needs a change.\nThat is why I am running.\nFirst, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nThe architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie \u2013 he called it the \"stupidity of the American voter.\" But the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the American people.\nDo you remember all the lies? President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\nHe promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.\nNow, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.\nHe has absolutely trashed President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare \"one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party of our country.\"\nBill has a different view. Here is what bill said:\nHe just said it's a \"crazy system,\" where people end up with \"premiums doubled and coverage cut in half.\" He said \"it's the craziest thing in the world.\"\nBill Clinton said:\n\"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half\u2026the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.\" Clinton added that it \"doesn't make any sense,\" and that \"the insurance model doesn't work.\"\nI couldn't agree more. Which is why, on my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\nThis is essential for Arizona. Because of Obamacare, most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year, and premiums are expected to go up by 49% next year.\nThere is only 1 way to stop it: to vote for Trump. Early ballots are mailed out on October 12th, and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly can.\nNext, we are going to unleash American energy\nI just met with energy producers in Colorado, and they are pleading with the government to let them create jobs and wealth in the United States.\nAs part our plan to reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs, we are going to lift the restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and all forms of job-producing American energy.\nFixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival\nChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money \u2013 the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.\nWe're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.\nOur jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.\nWhen I am President, we will start making things in America again.\nCompanies like Apple, will start making their computers and iPhones in our country.\nOur nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA \u2013 a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal \u2013 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nNever in history has a country surrendered so much of its wealth to foreign countries.\nAs the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.\nWe've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.\nAnd now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.\nWe are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.\nJobs will leave from other countries and come into the United States.\nFactories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay \u2013and new hope.\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.\nSecurity begins at the border.\nA nation that doesn't control is borders is not a nation.\nA country that doesn't protect its people isn't a country.\nA government that doesn't put its own citizens first is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.\nHere are some heartbreaking examples of how our government has failed our citizens.\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.\nSarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.\nThen there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.\nIn California, a 64-yeard old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.\nAlso in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 \u2013 he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant with three gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer \u2013 but despite these previous crimes, he had not been deported.\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.\nThere are more than 2 million criminal aliens in the county right now \u2013 when I am President, we are getting them out, and quickly.\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.\nAt the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just yesterday, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9\/11.\nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country \u2013 as was the mall shooter in Washington.\nOr look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fianc\u00e9 visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\nI am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.\nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.\nHillary is for open borders.\nI am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.\nFor the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.\nWe also have the endorsement of Sheriff Joe.\nWe are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. The chaos, the violence and the crime will come to an end \u2013 beginning in January of 2017.\nWe are going to end the government corruption\nHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails \u2013 after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate.\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.\nWe have become a Banana Republic.\nYesterday, we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it \u2013 by sending in your ballots.\nWe are also going to fix our inner cities\n45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty.\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.\nMore than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nThe Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, six years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime. They've horribly failed and abused our African-American and Latino communities.\nTo those African-Americans and Latinos suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nTo everyone in the country I say: what do you have to lose?\nWe will have safe communities for EVERYONE.\nSchool choice for your children.\nGreat trade deals that bring jobs into our country, not out of our country.\nEveryone will be included in the American Dream.\nHere are the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest job-creating tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe are going to rebuild America.\nWe are going to revitalize America.\nAnd we are going to unite America.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. We're going to make history. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.\nYou're going to look back at this event, and you're going to look back at November 8th, or the day you put in your early ballot, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nYou are going to be proud of your country again, and you are going to be proud of your President again.\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. A vote for commonsense government, solutions to problems. It's a vote for jobs, jobs, jobs.\nIt's a vote for a government of, by and for the people.\nAll together, we are going to \u2013\nMake America wealthy again.\nWe are going to make America strong again.\nWe are going to make America safe again.\nAnd we are going to make America great again.\n","78":"\n\"Thank you! Wow! Hello, Akron! Wow! I am so excited! It's just fabulous being back here again. I am so grateful to all of you. I want to thank your mayor, Mayor Horrigan. Thank you for welcoming me here. I want to thank two great members of Congress who fight for Akron, fight for Cleveland, fight for Youngstown, fight for Ohio and America, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge and Congressman Tim Ryan.\nNow, I'm pretty excited about being here today. And I was especially honored to receive the endorsement of LeBron James. Now, I may become president, but he will be king of Ohio for as long as there is a king. I'm obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability. But I'll tell you what really moved me the most is he's given back to his hometown. He has advocated for small businesses, for kids, giving kids more opportunities. He's spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform. He is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice. So I am truly honored to have his support, and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how I am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball, but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways.\nNow, we do have an important election coming up. Who here is planning to vote? Well, that is very good news because this is the most consequential election, I think, in our lifetimes. The choice could not be clearer, and we need everybody to show up. And how many of you still have to register to be able to vote? Everybody here registered? Well, I want you to talk to your friends because the deadline for registering in Ohio is October 11th. That's just a little over a week away. And if you're not sure whether or not someone you know is registered, or maybe you yourself want to be absolutely positive, you can go to iwillvote.com \u2013 see that sign over there? You can go to iwillvote.com and confirm your registration and register if you need to.\nSo let's get everybody you know to register and maybe start voting when early voting starts on October the 12th because we have just 36 days left. Thirty-six days, now, we are reaching out. We're making phone calls. We're knocking on doors. If you want to get involved, you can go to my website, hillaryclinton.com. Sign up to be part of this campaign in the next 36 days. You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, at 47246, and get involved, because we are running to win Ohio in this election.\nAnd everybody, everybody in the campaign, is crisscrossing Ohio. My daughter's been here a bunch. Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife Anne have been here. My husband's coming back tomorrow for a two-day bus tour through Ohio. And I will be back because we care about Ohio and we want to make sure Ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state.\nNow, I'm going to close this campaign the way that I started my career a long time ago, fighting for kids and families, standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life, making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the American dream. See, I believe the American dream is big enough for everybody. If you're willing to work for it and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America.\nNow, my opponent and I have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead, and that may be because we have very different life experiences. And that's okay. People have different families, different views of the world. But here's what I have noticed. I have noticed that he always puts himself first. And maybe that's because he was born into a millionaire family. He started his business with a $14 million loan from his father. His father bailed him out; apparently that's a pattern, you got to be bailed out when you do business with him. And he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code, of our economy, that he could.\nAnd along the way, along the way, he has stiffed people \u2013 small businesses and workers and contractors. And that's part of the reason I take this election so seriously. My dad was a small businessman. My grandfather was a factory worker. And so my dad, when he got out of the Navy in World War II, he started a small business. He started a printing business. He printed fabrics for draperies. And he worked really hard. He had a print plant in Chicago \u2013 no natural light, no windows, just a long room where there were two big, long tables, and the fabric would be laid out on them. And then if you've ever seen silkscreens, that's what he did. You take the silkscreen. You put it down. You pour the paint in. You take the squeegee. You go across. You lift it up. You go down to the end of one long table, you start on the end of the other long table. And then, if it was going to be two colors, you would add another color, doing exactly the same thing. It was before there was machines. My dad couldn't have afforded that anyway. But he worked really hard, and he produced a good middle class life for our family.\nAnd so when I think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people, I got to tell you, I am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him, because I have met people he stiffed. I have met people. I'm talking painters and plumbers. I'm talking dishwashers, marble installers, glass installers, architects, a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos. He wouldn't pay them. Now, you got to stop and ask yourself, what kind of person does that? Somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored.\nAnd so I met one of the men. I met a man who had a small family business, installed the glass in one of those casinos, submitted the bill, and Trump said, no. we're not going to pay it. And the man was stunned, as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been. And then they come back, the Trump organization or Trump himself, and say, okay, we'll give you 10 cents, 20 cents, maybe 30 cents on the dollar. Now, some of those small businesses, they couldn't afford that. They had bought the material, They had provided the services. Trump didn't care. He basically just walked away from them, made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work they'd been asked to provide. I got to tell you, that is not the way we're supposed to do business in America. And I can't imagine having a president who believes that that's the way you're supposed to treat people. But you're going to help me make sure he never gets near the White House.\nNow, earlier today, earlier today in Toledo, I talked about all of the changes I want to make in how we can protect Americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of. Now, the most recent example is Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo actually had people, thousands of their employees, putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand. And then every time they put somebody into a new account, they got fees, which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus \u2013 a really crummy game that hurt people. So thankfully, we have an organization now, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in Washington, who looks out for people who get [...]. That is an important part of how we're going to protect. And it's run, you may know, by Richard Cordray from Ohio.\nNow, will it surprise you that Donald Trump wants to eliminate that agency? Well, we're not going to let that happen. That agency has already recovered $11 billion for consumers who've been taken advantage of by corporations. And the behavior of Wells Fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008.\nI have said we're never going to let Wall Street wreck Main Street again, and I mean it. Contrast that \u2013 contrast that with my opponent. He wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on Wall Street. He basically wants to let Wall Street, the banks, the hedge funds, all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again. Well, I'll tell you what, we're not going to let that happen. We need more rules, not fewer rules on them.\nI want us to make it easier to start a small business, to get rid of the red tape, to make credit available, to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America, so we should have a big, dynamic small business economy. But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore. That is not working for us.\nBut Trump's whole economic vision is really trickle-down economics. It's the same \u2013 the same idea that has failed us before. You see, he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down. Well, we know that doesn't work. We've been down that road. And what he wants to do is, I think it's fair to say, trickle-down on steroids. What he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy.\nNow, I'm a little confused about this because for a long time we've been saying, 'Hey, where are your tax returns?' A lot of us wondered what he was hiding. Because you know, if it was something that would make him look good, he would put them right out there. Everybody who's ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns. My husband and I have about 40 years of tax returns out there. You can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes, and frankly, we were grateful we could. We are grateful for the blessings that we've had over the last 15 years.\nSo did any of you see the debate last Monday? Well, I raised it. I said, 'Well, maybe he doesn't want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders, or maybe he hasn't paid any taxes.' Now, shortly after the debate, it was discovered that, indeed, back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos. Ask yourself this: Who loses money on casinos? Really. And yesterday some of his supporters said, 'Well, it just shows he's a genius that he didn't pay any taxes.' Well, what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place?\nIn the debate, he said not paying taxes made him smart. But think about what that means. It means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes, right \u2013 what's he saying about us? But more than that, zero taxes means zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for Pell Grants to send young people to college, zero for health, zero for education. And you stop and ask yourself, this is the same person who's been going around really just dumping on America. He says our military's a disaster. Well, he could not be more wrong, but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us.\nToday in Colorado, he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes. Well, that just shows, number one, he is the poster boy \u2013 the poster boy \u2013 for the same rigged system that he would make even worse. Just think about it. He paid zero at least for about 20 years, we believe now based on what we know. And he's advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more. What's he want us to do, pay him to lose money? Really?\nThere's a lot more to this story, and we're just slowly getting it into the public eye. So we know he's stiffed people, didn't pay his bills. We know he took bankruptcy, depending on how you count, four or six times. You know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years. We don't know what his taxes would be after that. He's always talked about how he can't release his taxes because he's under audit, but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit, so Donald, release everything up until 2009. Show the American people your taxes.\nI'll tell you another thing. If I'm fortunate enough to be president, we're going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes.\nSo what did we find out today? Well, a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects. So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania, instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs, he once again stiffed us. He sent that money overseas.\nNow, he spends a lot of time bashing the Chinese, right? You hear that all the time when he talks. Well, it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the Chinese. It turns out he owes big money to the Chinese. So this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show, where he is saying one thing and doing something else.\nNow, for years, China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets. You know that, right? And it sounds like Donald Trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum. How can he make America great again when he won't even buy American products in our country?\nAnd I'll tell you, this is personal to me, because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented. And as Secretary of State, I went toe-to-toe with the Chinese. I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China, to stand up for American workers, and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum.\nAnd today in Toledo I pointed out, because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler \u2013 about 700 more jobs, right? I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850,000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job \u2013 more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here \u2013 Donald Trump said he didn't care. Save it, don't save it; didn't matter to him.\nWell, I'll tell you where I stood. I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry. And look what we got. Last year, our auto industry had the best year they've had in a really long time. And so we've got to keep building it. We've got to keep making sure that there are good jobs. And we've got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides.\nSo now, I know that Ohio is a tough, tough state. You've got to get out there. You've got to talk to people, answer questions, make your case. That's what we've been doing. That's what we're going to do all the way to the end of this election. But I need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for Trump. I know you know people. I know you do. And you've got to stage an intervention. You've got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done, and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in Ohio. In fact, if you look at his tax proposals, they benefit him and other wealthy people \u2013 hedge fund managers and the like, and they would actually raise taxes on middle-class families.\nNow, that's the kind of contrast we're getting out in the campaign, but that's why we need your help \u2013 to make sure you go out and talk to everybody. And I know people want change. That's part of the American dynamic spirit. We want change. Well, I'll tell you, one thing that is certain is we'll have change \u2013 it's just what kind of change. It's whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of Americans, hardworking Americans, middle-class families, or continues to only help those at the top. I want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And that's exactly what we're going to fight for, and that is what we're going to get.\nI'll tell you, I've been called a lot of things. Right? I've never been called quitter. If I tell you I'm going to get up every day and fight for you, that is exactly what I will do.\nBut I know I can't do it \u2013 I can't do it alone. Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America. And then he said, 'I alone can fix it.' He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship. He has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are. He has a weird fascination with dictators like Vladimir Putin. We have a lot of people living in this part of Ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression, and we're never going to let that happen again.\nAnd so when Trump basically signs up for Putin's wish list, that's bad enough. But then, when he's cavalier \u2013 and I'm not talking about basketball \u2013 when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons, saying that, oh, he doesn't care if other countries get them; in fact, you know, if there were a nuclear war in East Asia, if Japan got nuclear weapons, if South Korea got nuclear weapons, hey, just go at it, folks. He even said he wouldn't care if Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons. One thing that has been a bedrock of American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons, to be able to stop proliferation. And now it's even more important because it's not only states that we have to worry about, like North Korea; we've got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons. The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesn't matter, because it does.\nI was involved in putting together the sanctions against Iran that drove them to the negotiating table. And what I learned \u2013 if you use diplomacy and you're tough about it, you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program. And we're going to make sure they follow it to the period, the comma, everything in that agreement. I'm going to enforce. And we still have challenges with Iran, but I think we're in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections.\nSo I know diplomacy can work because I've done it, and I know that \u2013 we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations, if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air, takes them out on the ground, and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people. I've been laying out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat ISIS, and I have no doubt we will. And Donald says he has a secret plan. That he won't tell us about. Well, there's no secret; he has no plan.\nAnd we've got to do more \u2013 we've got to do more to make sure we protect our country. We need the best intelligence we can get, the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government. I will not rest. As a former Senator from New York on 9\/11, I take this as a personal responsibility. I will do everything I can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism.\nAnd finally, my friends, we've got to bring our country back together. There is too much divisiveness, too much finger-pointing and scapegoating. Our diversity is one of our strengths. We have to listen to each other. We don't have to agree; that is not required. But we need to be respectful. We need to listen. And then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work.\nWhen I was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, I worked to find common ground with everybody. I worked when I was First Lady with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids. When I was in the Senate, I worked with practically every Republican I served with. And they all have nice things to say about me when I'm not running for something. And I will work again to move our country forward and to change the [...] of that. And we had to get 13 Republicans, and I worked tirelessly and we got them. We did that. There is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of name-calling and insults that we see too much of.\nSo I'm excited about the campaign, but I'm even more excited about getting to work for you \u2013 being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody. I mean, that is how I was raised in my church and by my family, and that is what I have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice. And I will do everything possible to make sure I deliver results for you. And the reason that I have published a book with my great running mate, Tim Kaine \u2013 it's right here \u2013 is real simple: I want you to know what we say we're going to do, because I want you to hold me accountable. I don't believe in bait and switch, where I say, oh, we're going to do something and then I really am over here doing something else. That kind of reminds you of somebody, doesn't it? No, here's what we're going to try to do. We're going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations. And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class. That is not going to happen when I am president.\nSo please join this campaign in the last 36 days. Talk to your friends. Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. I am motivated every day because now I'm a grandmother \u2013 two beautiful grandchildren \u2013 and I think about their future, I think about their lives, I think about our country. I want our country to be the land of opportunity. The place where dreams do come true if you're willing to work for them. Not just for my grandchildren, but for every child. I want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. And if you will help me win this election, and then help me work to make it come true, we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of.\nThank you and God bless you!\"\n","79":"\n\"Hello, Toledo. I am \u2013 I am very happy to be here today and \u2013 I am so grateful to have this chance to talk to you about what we can do together to have the kind of economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nI want to acknowledge \u2013 we have an overflow crowd in another room, and I know they can hear us, but we're glad they're here. I want to thank your Congresswoman, Marcy Kaptur, for her leadership and her grit. I want to thank Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson. And the mayor told me there's a young man here who just won a boxing championship, Robert Easter. Where's Robert Easter? There you are, Robert Easter. Congratulations. I know Toledo is proud of you; we all are. I want to thank Kenyetta for that introduction. Do we have any other UAW members here?\nIt's a great day to be here in Ohio for a lot of different reasons. One is I am so thrilled that LeBron James has endorsed me and joined our campaign. I know \u2013 I've gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half. I'm grateful for each and every one of them. But I got to say, there's something special about this one. And it's a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me. Now, not everyone knows this. I mean, you all know what an amazing athlete he his \u2013 MVP, winner of championships \u2013 but he's also \u2013 LeBron is also a dedicated advocate for children. And this afternoon I'll be in Akron, where he's done so much for the kids in that community.\nIt's a deep, personal commitment that he has that I share with him. We both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch.\nNow, one thing I know \u2013 I'll just say it because I know it's for sure \u2013 I hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King.\nI was listening to Kenyetta introduce me, and I really appreciated what she said, because Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard, look after one another, and yes, pay their taxes, right?\nYou recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together, and it matters.\nWe believe honest work deserves honest pay. We believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back.\nIt's personal for me. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years. He believed he passed it down to my dad, who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do, he'd have a good life and his kids would have an even better life. That is the American dream. That is what we believe in. That's what we've got to keep going generation after generation.\nAnd because of my grandfather's hard work, my dad made it to college. And then after serving in the Navy during World War II, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.\nAs a young girl, I'd sometimes go to his print plant. It was a long building, no natural light, no windows, but he had these long tables where he'd roll out the fabric and then I'd watch him work with silkscreens, if you've ever seen that. He would take the silkscreen, he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, go across all the way down to the end of one table, then over to the next table, all the way back. And then if there was a second color to be added, he would do that. He sometimes let me help with the squeegee. That was my favorite part.\nAnd I know he worked really hard. He worked really hard. He believed in hard work. He passed that on to me. He provided a good middle-class life for us. So I am proud to stand with hardworking families all over Toledo, Ohio, and America, who should have the same chance that I did to share in the American Dream, which should be big enough for everybody.\nFighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life, as Kenyetta said, when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And it will be the mission of my presidency, because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues, the ones that keep you up at night \u2013 like the cost of child care, and college, and prescription drugs, and so much else.\nAnd that means we've got to create more good jobs with rising incomes. That means we've got to have good schools in every zip code. That means everybody willing to work \u2013 and I say that very clearly; you've got to be willing to work \u2013 and if you're willing to work, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. That is the basic bargain.\nNow, I don't know about you, but you wouldn't think that the theme of my campaign, 'getting an economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top' would be controversial \u2013 and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time.\nNow, I will say, most American companies \u2013 most \u2013 are run by honorable, patriotic people who care about their employees and communities. But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else. [Applause.] And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers, workers, small businesses, and taxpayers.\nThat makes it tougher for the well-meaning CEOs to take the high road. And it gets even harder when we don't aggressively enforce the rules, when we don't enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up, when we don't enforce rules on Wall Street, which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value, investing in workers, plant, and equipment over the longer term.\nAnd let's be honest, the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States. And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse. It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can't afford lawyers and lobbyists.\nSo with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction, it's even more important that we have an election about these very issues. Because what I know will happen \u2013 if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field, we will rebuild the middle class, we will make work pay, we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans.\nNow, I know how hard this, but I think we are on the cusp, if we win this election, to be able to get these things done, right?\"\nAudience: \"Yeah.\"\nClinton: \"That means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the American private sector. We've got unmatched talent, innovation, entrepreneurial spirit.\nSo when we work together, we can all benefit.\nNow, I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders \u2013 but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities, and yes, to our country, to the United States of America. We have been moving off track for decades. I don't need to tell you that. You know it, you've lived it, you've seen it. But it is time to get back on track.\nAnd you can ask anybody who's ever worked for me or worked with me, who's ever served with me, when I tell you I'm going to try to do something, I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you.\nSo let's begin by making it clear that for most businesses, America is the most important asset on their balance sheet. This country of ours, this system of ours, the rule of law, the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you. And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world, the American middle class. So when we middle class thrives, the country thrives. And when it doesn't, we don't, right?\nAnd I'm going to use the White House and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable. Standing up for America, investing in America will pay off.\nNow, we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value. But we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else.\nSo today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom, every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers, exploit your employees, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will find ways to hold you accountable.\nBut on the other side \u2013 on the other side, if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our country's future, we will stand with you. That is the choice. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better.\nNow, to understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we've seen of egregious corporate behavior.\nLook at Wells Fargo. Really shocking, isn't it? One of the nation's biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing personal information, and then sticking customers with hidden fees. It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law.\nAnd then in a category by himself, there's Donald Trump. Well, you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades. You can look at 40 years of my tax returns. I think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties, you have to release your tax returns.\nNow, a lot of us were wondering, what is he hiding? It must be really terrible. Well, The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer. Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos. Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kind of beyond me. It's just hard to figure. But as a result, it doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades.\nNow, while millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that. Not fair. Nothing for Pell Grants to help kids go to college. Nothing for veterans. Nothing for our military. And you know, he has been dissing America in this whole campaign. Right? He talks us down. He makes disparaging comments about our country. He calls our military a disaster. Well, it's not, but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform.\nI saw a newspaper article. A gentleman named Steve Crouse, who owns the Glass City Caf\u00e9 here in Toledo, summed it up pretty well in this article. He said, 'I would feel guilty if I didn't pay anything. It's flat-out cheating the government.' Now, my friend Bernie Sanders was right yesterday when he said Trump reflects a distorted view of the American people and what this country is all about.\nTrump represents the same rigged system that he claims he's going to change. The whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business. After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn't lift a finger to help and protect his employees, or all the small businesses and contractors he'd hired, or the people of Atlantic City. They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire. And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies. In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.\nNow, he says that he's the one who can fix things, but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse. Right? And here's what I really am just stunned by. I get stunned every day in this campaign. But here's one of the many things that I'm stunned by. He has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more. It would be like you're paying zero. You expect us to pay you to stay in business, all the rest of us in America? He'd open the loopholes even wider. And according to a new independent study, he would actually \u2013 listen to this, people, because this is a real shocker \u2013 his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families. And you know the people it would hit the hardest? Are single parents, whose lives and challenges he doesn't care about, certainly doesn't understand.\nNow, many have likely already spent years paying more than he did, and he now would make that even worse. And what does he say about it? Well, did you all see the debate last Monday? Well, in the debate \u2013 in the debate \u2013 well, then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes. Yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius. Here's my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?\nThis is Trump to a T. He's taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it. He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country's. It's Trump first and everyone else last. And there are lots of principled, law-abiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this. Not a single \u2013 not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company supports Trump's campaign. Think about it. I've been endorsed by very successful people \u2013 Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Mark Cuban. I loved what Mark Cuban said when he endorsed me. He said, 'Look, I've been successful.' He actually is a real billionaire. And you know what? He used profit-sharing to help his employees, not bankruptcy to fire people. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits with his employees, and 300 of them became millionaires. That's the kind of business practices I want to see more of in our country.\nBut here's what we've got to do. Even if Trump is like one of a kind, we've got to reverse the broader trends he represents. It's time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone. And today I want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers, consumers, small businesses, and workers. We're going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs, in higher wages, and in stronger communities.\nFirst let's start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system. It is wrong that corporations and the super-wealthy play by a different set of rules. A Wall Street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse. And I'll tell you something else. Our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all. It is insulting when they engage in these games, like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country \u2013 on paper, not in reality \u2013 just to take advantage of lower tax rates. And it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in America with the other hand.\nSo here's what we're going to do. We're going to close those loopholes. I've got a list of them we're going after. We're going to make Wall Street corporations and the super-rich start paying their fair share of taxes. We're going to pass something called the Buffett rule, which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them. We're going to put in place a new exit tax. If companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share, if they try to outsource jobs, they're going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country. And then we're going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in America.\nSecond, we're going to protect consumers. No American should ever be taken advantage of, like thousands were, by Wells Fargo. And this isn't a new fight for me. As a Senator, I raised the alarm about subprime mortgages. I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids. I introduced legislation to protect Americans' personal data and combat identity theft. So as president, I will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government.\nAnd that starts by defending and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau, which was created after the financial crisis. And the principal person who got it created was Senator Elizabeth Warren. And under the leadership of Ohio's Rich Cordray, the agency has already returned more than $11 billion to more than 15 million Americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders, credit card companies, and others. And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back.\nNow, I got to say I am so proud of what this new agency has done. Sometimes people say, well, what does the government really do? Well, there's a lot of examples, but this is a primary one, standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off. And because of its success, Republicans in Congress keep trying to shut it down. And Donald Trump agrees with them. In fact, he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on Wall Street after the crisis. Well, not on my watch, Donald. We're never going to let that happen.\nNow, instead of gutting consumer protection, we should be expanding it. And we should build on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and go even further because Wall Street can never, ever be permitted to threaten Main Street again. And the Wells Fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address. When the scam's victims, people like you and me, who had accounts there tried to sue, they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated. Instead, they are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law. We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine print \"gotchas\" to escape accountability.\nAnd in fact, this is now common practice across a lot of industries \u2013 from nursing homes, nursing homes that mistreat seniors, to for-profit colleges that defraud students. Who reads all that fine print? I don't. And you get defrauded or you get mistreated, and then all of a sudden they say, 'Well, you can't sue us.' So we're going to rein in that abuse across everybody.\nWe also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else. It's one of the reasons I'm against it. I've warned about this for years, I've written about it, and I oppose TPP now, I will oppose it after the election, I will oppose it as president \u2013 because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers.\nAnd what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason? We're going to have to protect ourselves against that too. And when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding, life-saving drugs, we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs.\nAnd let's finally import safe alternatives from other countries, like Canada, and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market. And it is long past time to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for Medicare recipients. And I believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine. No one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions.\nSo let's stand up for taxpayers. Let's stand up for consumers. And let's stand up for small businesses, which create most of the jobs in America. I take this personally be-cause of my dad's very small business. We need fair rules of the road so big corporations can't use their power to gain unfair advantages.\nNow, when it comes to bullying small businesses, Donald Trump is the poster boy. I have heard so many stories of contractors, and I've met some too, who worked for him, produced the goods and services, and never got paid for what they were owed. I'm talking about painters, and plumbers, piano sellers, architects, glass installers \u2013 he stiffed them all. Not because he couldn't pay them, but he wouldn't pay them. And he told them, 'You want to get your money? Sue me.' My dad could never have done that. I'm just grateful my dad never got a contract with Donald Trump, because I don't know what we would have done.\nMore than 60 percent of small businesses face payment delays. That can cause a serious cash flow crisis. So as president, I will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field. Part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy. Sometimes it's called market concentration or even old-fashioned monopolies, but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes, as well as consumers. With less competition, corporations can use their power to raise prices, limit choice for consumers, cut wages for workers, crowd out startups and small businesses.\nI mean, look what's happening right now. In most of the country, the three largest health insurance companies in each state control 80 percent of the market. No wonder premiums are going up. As president, I will appoint tough, independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions, so the big don't keep getting bigger and bigger.\nI want every business to compete and thrive, and then I also want to do something else. Let's protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy. Everyone who works hard should be able to share in the rewards, not just senior executives. So we're proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to share profits, on top of, not instead of, higher wages.\nWe need to support new organizing strategies for employees who too often have never had the benefit of collective bargaining. And we have to resist the assault on workers' rights. Let's say loudly and clearly: 'right to work' is wrong for workers and wrong for America.\nLet's also, my friends, let's raise the minimum wage and support the Fight for 15 so you don't live in poverty. Let's defend overtime and go after wage theft. Let's provide family leave that is paid and access to affordable, high-quality childcare. And of course you know what I'm going to say: let's finally guarantee equal pay for women.\nNow, my opponent and his chief surrogates like to say I'm playing the woman's card. And I'll tell you \u2013 right? \u2013 if fighting for working families is playing the women's card, you know what? Deal me in!\nAnd then finally, I've got a lot on my mind, but finally, we need to make it easier for companies to invest in good jobs here at home. As president, I will ramp up enforcement of trade rules by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor and tripling the number of enforcement officers. We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. I want to direct $10 billion to create a 'Make It in America' partnership to support American manufacturing. And I want to take some of the ideas that worked when my husband was President and we ended up with 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.\nThat includes incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit for creating good jobs in poor or remote areas, from inner cities to rural communities ravaged \u2013 ravaged \u2013 by hollowed-out factories, ravaged by mines that have been shut down, ravaged by opiate addiction. It all comes down to this: When I say our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top, I mean it. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure workers are treated like assets, not costs. And we're going to bring back infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean, renewable energy jobs, innovation, technology, small business.\nNow, you don't have to look any further than right here in Northwest Ohio. Just a few years ago, as you heard Kenyetta say, in 2009 you were in the eye of the storm. Jobs, homes, savings, wiped out. The auto industry on the verge of collapse. A lot of people were ready to give up on it. Well, that would have meant giving up on 850,000 people across this state whose jobs were tied to the industry. Donald Trump, for one, said rescuing the auto industry didn't matter very much. Either way would have been acceptable, he said. 'We could have just let it go,' and that's a direct quote from him. Everybody in Ohio who's thinking about voting for Trump needs to hear that. At the time of the worst financial crisis in Ohio in 2009, he would have let you twist and fall. And for his running mate he picked Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of the auto rescue. Well, thank goodness the people of Northwest Ohio weren't ready to let it go. You never gave up. You didn't lose faith. And now, after a lot of hard work and sacrifice, the auto industry just had its best year ever.\nBut that's not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work, America, America, came to the rescue. Taxpayers like all of us, not him but us, provided the funds for the rescue. Union workers stepped up. Communities like Toledo came together to make it work. And now that the industry's back on its feet, the auto companies have a responsibility to give back.\nSo I was delighted to hear that Chrysler is doubling down on Toledo, investing $700 million here to start building the next generation Jeep Wrangler, which could create about 700 new good jobs. And tens of thousands of UAW workers at Chrysler plants should see a big increase in profit-sharing payments above and beyond wages and benefits. Now, that's the way it's supposed to work, when we all help each other out. When we stand together, we are stronger together.\nSo what I want you to know is if you join me in this campaign, I will always stand up and fight for you and fight for your jobs and fight for your families. And I guess we have about 36 days left. The election's going to be close. Every call you make, every door you knock, every friend you register to vote, could make the difference. You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now or go to hillaryclinton.com to sign up and volunteer. Here in Ohio you have until October the 11th to register to vote. And there are people with clipboards around, and you can go actually register today on your way out the door.\nSo we have just over a week to register, and then early voting starts October 12th. Let's prove \u2013 let's prove \u2013 that the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. Let's prove that we're going to stand together, make the smart decisions that we get the economy going and growing for everybody, not just those at the top; that we will stand up against special privilege and special interest; that we will be ready after this election to have an agenda that will really make a difference here in Toledo and across Ohio. So I'm here asking for your help, asking for your work, asking for you to be part of this campaign, and then when we win on November 8, be part of changing our country for the better! Thank you all and God bless you!\"\n","80":"\nThis is such an amazing city. It's called \"Home of the Heroes,\" because of your proud tradition of military service. Pueblo is home to Four Medal of Honor Recipients. As President Eisenhower said, there must be \"something in the water out there in Pueblo\" because \"all you guys turn out to be heroes.\"\nColorado is home to six military bases. We are going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military.\nAnother great Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing. We are going to conserve your land for future generations, and we are going to save the 2nd amendment.\nOne other issue of such great importance in Colorado is energy. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the mines, and shut down shale, oil, and natural gas. We are going to end the war on American energy, and we are going to put the miners back to work.\nI have also made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cut since Ronald Reagan \u2013and the largest regulatory reform in American history. That is because I know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people of this country are.\nA central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code, an issue of concern to all Americans.\nAlong with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping us safe from terrorism, redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs, fixing the tax code is one of the main reasons I'm running for President.\nI've been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous, complex and yes, unfair, our tax system is. This is not the fault of the IRS, but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists.\nIt is these politicians who wrote the tax code, and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing, an already over-complicated set of laws \u2013 all at the behest of their favored donors and special interests.\nIt's thousands of pages long, and almost no one understands it. The average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade their way through it.\nMany so-called experts, due to the sheer size and complexity of the code, don't have a clue what these pages represent.\nThe unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable, it's something I've been talking about for a long time \u2013 despite being a beneficiary.\nI understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am the one who can fix them \u2013 and that is what I commit to doing.\nAs a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit, and to the benefit of my company and my employees.\nI have often said on the campaign trail, that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required \u2013 or, put another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible.\nAs a major real estate developer in this country, and throughout the world, I face enormous taxes: city taxes, state taxes, sales and excise taxes, employee taxes, and federal taxes. It's my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible \u2013 which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods, workers, and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities \u2013 and always help our great providers of jobs, the small business.\nThe news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990's, at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country's history.\nThe conditions facing real estate developers in the early nineties were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008.\nWhat had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically \u2013 and the business landscape changed with it: Bank failures, the collapse of the Savings & Loan industry, and the implosion of the retail market, and real estate in general.\nMany business people, including many of my competitors, were not able to survive. Companies, jobs, and opportunities were lost \u2013 and lives were destroyed, as tens of thousands of people were put out of work. Some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankrupt.\nYet today, my company is bigger, stronger, with far greater assets, and more premium properties, than ever before.\nThat did not happen by chance or luck \u2013 it happened by action, and talent.\nI was able to use the tax laws of this country, and my business acumen, to dig out of this real estate depression when few others did. In those most difficult times, when so many had their backs to the wall, I reached within myself and delivered for my company, my employees, my family and the communities where my properties existed.\nThose who spend their entire lives within the confines of government work, and who know virtually nothing of business, fail to understand the skill, dedication, and sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early nineties. People like my opponent Hillary Clinton, whose only method of making money is by selling\ngovernment favors and granting access to special interests, know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow. Hillary Clinton has never created a single job in her entire life \u2013 or added a single dollar of value to the American economy. Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest dollar in her entire life \u2013 all she does is take from you, from our country, and peddles influence to donors, special interests, and foreign actors \u2013 for astronomical dollars and like never before. It's corruption of the highest order.\nWhile I made my money as a highly-successful private businessman following the law, Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office up for sale.\nBy her own account, Hillary Clinton left the White House dead broke, and now she and her husband have made more than $200 million dollars \u2013 without building a company, or creating a single thing of value.\nDuring the early nineties, as companies were collapsing left and right, the media and powers that be said Donald Trump could never make it back. They said I had billions of dollars in borrowing, and hundreds of millions in personal guarantees, and no pathway out.\nBut, I never had any doubts and never gave up.\nThat's because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform at my very best. And when people make the mistake of underestimating me, that's when they are in for their biggest surprise.\nJust look at what happened in the primary. Just look at what our incredible movement is doing right now.\nThe reason I never felt endangered during the real estate downturn, was that I knew myself, I knew my business, I knew the financial system, I knew the tax code and, most importantly, I knew how to fight. That's what I am \u2013 a fighter, and I am now going to fight for you.\nWith my knowledge, I knew that I would make a comeback in business.\nThat is why I am here today. That is why I have left private business for public life \u2013 because I\nunderstand our country is in very bad shape. And now our country is in need of a major comeback \u2013 it needs one now more than ever.\nWe owe $20 trillion dollars in debt, but that's only part of the story \u2013 we have over $100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities, and we have a budget that's out of control with annual deficits. In addition, because of the incompetence of our leaders, we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis, now almost $800 billion a year.\nOur country is broke.\nWe have decaying infrastructure, failing schools, rising crime, a depleted military, an open border, and an economy that can't create full-time high-paying jobs. We are a divided nation, and each week it seems we are getting more and more divided, with race riots in our streets on a\nmonthly basis.\nThis is not the America that was handed down to us, and it's not the America we want for our children. And it's certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren. But this is the America we will have if we don't turn things around \u2013 starting today.\nWhat I say is not lost on the American people, because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction.\nWe cannot have another 4 years of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton will be worse.\nWe can turn this all around \u2013 but not if we don't make a change in leadership RIGHT NOW. The failed political establishment must go \u2013 it must go for the sake of your country, your future, and those you love the most.\nIn the early 90's, they splashed the front pages with stories about how I was finished. Everybody said that I was done \u2013 there were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. They were thrilled and delighted to write these negative stories.\nSo they said I was finished. The only person who didn't think that I was in trouble was Donald Trump.\nI started my company with a small loan and, as I grew, I borrowed money to grow the company. When the bottom fell out of the Real Estate market, I had all the debt, it stayed the same \u2013 but the value of the assets plummeted. But I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others did not.\nMy understanding of the tax code gave me a big advantage over those who didn't have a clue, including many of my competitors who lost everything they had, never to be heard from again.\nNow, they're gone, and I'm here and I'm ready to turn things around for this country.\nThe early 90's was a very tough time for the world, but in tough times you need tough people.\nThese are tough times for America today, and we need tough leaders. Not people who tell you what you want to hear, but people who tell you what you need to hear: we must never allow corrupt career politicians, like the Clintons, ever back into the White House again.\nThese tough times were when I performed my very best. The economy and banks collapsing, the government was a mess \u2013 but I enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle. I enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company and win. That's the thinking we need for our country \u2013 that's the thinking we need when we are negotiating trade deals, and military deals, and economic deals on behalf of the American people.\nPut me into the boardroom as YOUR representative, and I will deliver for you. Hillary Clinton is in it only for herself and her donors. I am here fighting for America.\nMany people have said that I perform better under pressure than anyone they've ever seen \u2013 I've proven that over and over again.\nThat's what I do. When the pressure is on, when the odds are stacked against me, when people say it can't be done \u2013 that's when I am just getting started.\nThe thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is impossible. For me, impossible is just a starting point.\nFrom the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs. Our company, and our employees, remade skylines, revitalized neighborhoods, rejuvenated communities, and hired thousands of workers.\nOn November 8th, America's comeback begins \u2013 and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\nThe people here in Pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this country.\nThis is a city with a rich immigrant history, and a rich Latino history, that has contributed so much to this country and this state. Though the people of Pueblo, and their families, have hailed from all regions of the world, you are united by this one thing: You are all Americans.\nAnd, as Americans, you are entitled to the same protections as every other American. Everyone lawfully living inside of our borders are entitled to the same things: safe communities, a great education, and access to high-paying jobs.\nThis is the change I will deliver. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and delivered nothing but failure. Her policies have brought death and destruction overseas, and poverty at home. She's brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially African-American and Hispanic Citizens.\nShe opposes school choice, and wants to trap poor African-American and Hispanic children in failing government schools. We are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.\nHillary Clinton supports Obamacare, and wants to expand it \u2013 Obamacare is an absolute disaster. Premiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20 percent \u2013 the only way to stop this disaster is to vote Trump.\nHillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals, like Bill Clinton's NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization \u2013 and next she wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal she calls the \"Gold Standard.\"\nColorado has lost more than 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since the NAFTA and China deals.\nBut while you've lost out, Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors. She and Bill have made $150 million in speeches to special interests. They gave 39 speeches to Big Banks, including $2 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State.\nTo hide her corruption, Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she deleted and bleached 33,000 emails \u2013 after a congressional subpoena -- to hide them from the public. She lies to Congress, under oath, and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate.\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.\nWe have become a Banana Republic.\nNow, today, we learned, that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY\ntheir laptops.\nLet me repeat that: the FBI reportedly made a deal to DESTROY the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up.\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it \u2013 by showing up and voting on November 8th.\nPeople have had it with the years, the decades of Clinton Corruption.\nThis is the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.\nThe Clintons are the sordid past. We are the bright future.\nNow, another issue I want to address today is immigration. As I mentioned, Pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants. It is these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open borders immigration policy.\nIllegal immigration, and broken visa programs, take jobs directly from Hispanic workers living here lawfully today.\nIllegal immigration also brings with it massive crime, and massive drugs \u2013 including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado.\nWe are going to build a border wall, and we are going to stop the drugs, gangs and the violence from pouring into Colorado.\nWe are going to shut down the Sanctuary Cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many.\nCases like Kate Steinle, murdered in San Francisco by a 5-time deported illegal immigrant.\nOr cases like Sarah Root, killed by an illegal immigrant released at the border by President Obama \u2013 and then released again after the killing.\nThere are over 2 million criminal aliens in this county, and we are going to get them out \u2013 and we are going to get them out quickly.\nTo the cartels, the gangs, the drug dealers, I have a simple message for you: your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.\nWe also have to keep our country safe from terrorism. The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country \u2013 as was the mall shooter in Washington.\nOr look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fianc\u00e9 visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\nTerrorists are infiltrating our country.\nNow, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees\nfrom across the Middle East.\nI want to keep you and your family safe.\nMy job is not to represent foreign countries. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America \u2013 putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first.\nIf you are living in the United States today as a lawful resident or U.S. citizen, I will ensure you have a safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system.\nImmigration Security is National Security.\nHere are some more things we will do starting in 2017 \u2013\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe are going to rebuild America.\nWe are going to revitalize America.\nAnd we are going to unite America.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nTogether, we will make America wealthy again.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we will make America great again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","81":"\nIt is a privilege to be here this morning with so many distinguished members of our armed services.\nBefore we get started with our Q & A, I'd like to address one of the most important aspects of America's national security, and that's Cyber Security.\nTo truly make America safe, we must make cybersecurity a major priority for both the government and the private sector.\nCyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States.\nAs President, improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my Administration.\nOne of the very first things I will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses, including all vital infrastructure.\nCyber-attacks from foreign governments, especially China, Russia, and North Korea along with non-state terrorist actors and organized criminal groups, constitute one of our most critical national security concerns.\nHillary Clinton's only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive cover-up, and putting the entire nation in harm's way. The fact that a former Senator and Secretary of State claimed not to know what the letter \"C\" means is just one more example of why she's unfit to hold public office.\nThe scope of our cyber security problem is enormous. Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets, and our citizens' most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacks.\nJust consider some of these recent hacks:\nJP Morgan Chase had 73 million emails stolen.\nE-Bay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwords.\nTarget was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers.\nAttacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world, and the costs in our privacy, our security and on our financial sector are extraordinary.\nIdentify theft, financial laundering, as well as ransom ware \u2013 involving the extortion of a hacked institution \u2013 are all becoming increasingly common.\nIncredibly, hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent FBI background investigations.\nThe information hacked contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the Federal Government. It is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmail.\nThe fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the Obama Administration has failed.\nWe should not let this be like the history of the Mafia which was allowed to grow into a nation-wide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long time.\nWe can learn from this history that when the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DEA and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in Task Forces directed at the Mafia, they were able to have great success in prosecuting them, seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society.\nAs President, I will instruct the Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the United States to work together with Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime.\nI will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense. I will also ask my Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command.\nAs a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources, the United States must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter-attacks. This is the warfare of the future, America's dominance in this arena must be unquestioned.\nCyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well.\nFor non-state terror actors, the United States must develop the ability \u2013 no matter how difficult \u2013 to track down and incapacitate those responsible. We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists.\nTo enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies, we will put together a team of the best military, civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technology.\nThe Cyber Review Team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first, but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits.\nI will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved.\nThe review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies.\nThis will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees, and identity protection for government employees.\nThe review team will also remain current on the constantly-evolving new methods of attack, and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occur.\nThis group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials, requiring them to follow best practices.\nThey will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them, along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense.\nThose who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law. I will appoint an Attorney General who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate. My Attorney General will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice.\nToday is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cyber-crime and evolving national security threats, and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century.\n","82":"\n\"This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it!\nI am so [...] and so honored to be here. Thank you so much Reverend Dr. Walker. Thanks to the members of the Little Rock A.M.E. Zion. I have to confess \u2013 we were putting together the [...] Rev. Walker was [...]\nBut he told me his church [...] 134 years ago was founded in a house on a rock and that rock has been sturdy and steady [...]\nI am so delighted to be here with your Congresswoman, Congresswoman Adams, who has a [...] path in the Congress, such a [...] of conviction. And my thanks also to Donna [...] for her leadership for that stirring description [...] Thank you so much.\nThis church for all those years has been a source of strength and solace, for generations of congregants and [...] It has helped people get [...]. It has helped people deal with the sorrows that come [...] and it has [...] the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief. In here, in this magnificent house of worship, we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls. In here, we are called to confront injustice, even when the world out there fails to see it. In here, we see the world as it is, but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be.\nIt has been 12 days since Mr. Scott was shot and killed. Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die, and seven children lost their father. Now we don't yet know all the details about the shooting, but we do know this family and this community is in pain. And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses. But we do more than pray. As Ms. Bradford said, 'We do what each of us can do.' Not everyone can march, but everyone can talk, and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote.\nToo many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves. In fact, the day before Mr. Scott died, another father, Terence Crutcher, was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And there have been many others. So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary, everyday activities. Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles, listening to music in their car with friends.\nAnd we also know -- and we must not forget -- that violence has touched the families of police officers. Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others. From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia, the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well.\nIt's been a hard year, hasn't it? Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy, another shattered family, another distressed community. And our children are watching, and they feel it too. You've seen that right here in Charlotte. Last Monday at the city council meeting, 10-year-old Taje Gaddy said, 'I wake up every morning scared that I won't get to grow up because I am black.'\nA nine-year-old, Zianna Oliphant, who's here with us today, along with her brother Marquis and her family, also spoke at that city council meeting, with tears pouring down her face. And when I read what she had said, I had tears in my eyes too. She said, 'We are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this. It's a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed, and we can't even see them anymore. It's a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.' What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world.\nBut can you imagine, nine years old. She should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her. Instead she's talking about graveyards. Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what's going on here, and across America, to imagine what we see on the news, and what we hear about, imagine through our children's eyes.\nI'm a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers. They have different, and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face. It makes my heart ache, when kids like Zianna, are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless. I know how I would feel. I wouldn't be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let's be honest here \u2013 they won't face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council.\nYou know, every child deserves the same sense of security, every child deserves the same hope. They should not be facing fear, they should be learning and growing, imagining who they can be, and what their contributions to our country could be as well. We've got to take action, we've got to start now, not tomorrow, not next year, now. We know we can't solve all these problems over night, which means we don't have a moment to lose.\nProverbs tells us, 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.' So let's hold on to a common vision. Let's come together to make America a place where every child, no matter who they are, where they're born or what they look like, has the chance to live up to their God-given potential.\nBeing stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other. We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers. We can call for reforms to policing, while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity.\nI think about an officer named Montrell Jackson. You might not have heard of him, but I want you to. He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge. A few days before he died, he wrote on Facebook, he was black but he wore blue. 'In uniform,' he wrote, 'I get nasty, hateful looks. Out of uniform, some consider me a threat. These are trying times. Please don't let hate infect your heart.' And then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug, 'I got you.'\nMontrell Jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas. And most officers will tell you they can't do one without the other. I believe we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system, not half measures but full measures, with real follow-through. In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law.\nThat starts with being honest. Being unafraid to face the facts. Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing. We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses. We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations. We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education. And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.\nGun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, more than the next nine causes combined. We've got to make sure there are good jobs, equality affordable housing in every zip code in America. We need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind. I am a strong supporter of Congressman Jim Clyburn's plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more.\nNow, there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division. Who want to exploit people's fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart. They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more 'law and order.' As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn't exist. Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that. Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that. But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both. This is not an either-or question for America.\nI want us to commit ourselves to this common vision. That is where I will build on the work that President Obama has done. And I will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election. This is much bigger than an election. These are issues I've been fighting for since I was a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund. Going to South Carolina to try to get young teenagers, 13, 14-year-olds out of jails with adult offenders. I care deeply about this because it's not just personal to so many of us, it's about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren. I think about that every time I see my grandchildren or every time I see a bright, energetic, impressive young woman like Zianna. Come up here a minute, would you?\nI love your dress.\nYou know, God loves us all, right? We are called to care for and cherish each other. It's not easy, it is not. But that is our mission and that is what we are called to do, not only as Christians but as Americans, as human beings to understand and respect each other. To fight for each other's children, each other's dignity, each other's opportunity as if they were our own. Now, make no mistake, this is not easy work. You've been doing this since Adam and Eve came here. But it is righteous work. Protecting all of God's children is America's calling. Remember what scripture also tells us: 'Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.' We will not grow weary and we will not lose heart. We will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of God's people. Thank you.\"\n","83":"\nI am going to fight so hard for all of you, and I am going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and your country.\nIn 39 days, we are going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win the White House.\nIt is going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.\nWe are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth, and your middle class.\nWe are going to take on the arrogant, corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity \u2013 a theft that has left behind crumbling schools, roads, bridges and a\ndepleted military.\nIt is time to rebuild Detroit. It is time to rebuild Michigan. It is time to rebuild the United States of America.\nHillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have ripped the jobs right out of Michigan. These are the people whose policies raided the jobs from Detroit. That's how she gets rich \u2013 by taking your jobs and your money away from you.\nThat's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100% approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The deal she called the \"Gold Standard.\" The TPP will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and so many other states across this country.\nHillary Clinton's donors want the TPP \u2013 and their wish is her command.\nThese special interests pay her for speeches. They pay her Foundation. They pay her husband. In return, they GET YOUR JOBS. Like I've been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is remember these words: FOLLOW THE MONEY.\nHillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions. Her close associate and confidant, Terry McAuliffe, said she'd pass it. Her husband has talked it up. Everyone knows she's for it, because she doesn't believe in protecting American Sovereignty.\nHillary Clinton only believes in protecting one thing: her donors.\nOf the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP, 82 or nearly 1 in 3 donated between $21 and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n9 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches.\nOf the 12 signatory countries that are parties to TPP, 3 gave between $6 and $15 million to the Clinton Foundation.\nAt least 4 lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign.\nOn November 8th, We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and we are going to do something that has been a long, long time coming: WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.\nHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\nHillary Clinton is the one who rigged the system.\nWe are the ones who are going to change the system so it's fair and just for every American.\nWe have a movement. The corrupt establishment is panicking because they know how hard it is to stop us. The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help Hillary Clinton and to cling to their power and prestige.\nThe arrogant political class doesn't believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans.\nThey don't believe in secure borders and strong walls.\nThese Washington and Wall Street insiders don't believe in hiring more police, producing more American energy, or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools.\nFor decades, we've talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders. 2016 is our long-awaited chance to fix the problem \u2013 and to hold our politicians accountable. If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system: show up and vote.\nWhen you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding this county dry, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell all of them: you're fired.\nIn their place, will be a new government. We are the Party of Abraham Lincoln, and once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe are going to do it together. In 39 days, everything is going to change.\nNow, the media doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption. So we are going to spell it out for them today.\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\nShe and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\nFavors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.\nShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale \u2013 and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\nWe are going to call them the FBI Immunity Five. So here's my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?\nAnd here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself?\nNo one is above the law. Not even Hillary Clinton.\nClinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on\npower \u2013 to keep their control over this country.\nRemember the Clinton pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money?\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton \u2013 they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over \u2013 she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"\nTo the African-American community, let me ask you this question: are you better off than you were eight years ago? If not, vote for Donald Trump. I will bring jobs, great education, and safe neighborhoods.\nIf you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results.\nLook at what the Democrats have done to Detroit. Half of Detroit residents do not work. Nearly 40% of the city lives in poverty. It's the second most dangerous city in America, according to the FBI.\nThis is the legacy of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.\nA Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\nEvery wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated.\nWe will unleash the power of American energy.\nThe catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.\nAnd the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in Michigan, will be renegotiated \u2013 and we will bring back your auto-manufacturing.\nMichigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO \u2013 both deals pushed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nBefore NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.\nFord is moving its small car production to Mexico.\nIt used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nHillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, which has cost this country another 100,000 jobs.\nHillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for President in 2007. She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korea deal \"will hurt the us auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive.\" She pledged to reject the deal.\nBut she lied to all of you, just like she lied about her emails.\nOnce installed as Secretary of State, she supported it and called it a \"cutting-edge deal.\" She rammed it through to adoption \u2013 she always does whatever the donors tell her to do, no matter how it impacts our families, schools and communities.\nThe U.S. trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose. This is what Hillary Clinton did to your state.\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members, and the country lost 740,000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved, as Hillary Clinton is planning to do.\nHillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.\nShe even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet, which is happening tomorrow. Hillary Clinton's website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a \"global community of stakeholders.\"\nSomeone needs to inform Hillary Clinton it's not the job of our leaders to represent a \"global community.\" It's the job of our leaders to represent American citizens. Losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country.\nHillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the American people want never seem to happen?\nThe reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your\nfamily.\nJust look at how badly she messed up on the Iran deal. And, just today, we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released, the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Iran's missile programs.\nHillary Clinton is there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors \u2013 we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\nThey're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\nYou have 39 days until the election. You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed\nfor your country come true.\nDo Not Let This Chance Slip Away.\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the\nAmerican voter.\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.\nHere are just some of the great things that will happen for your country:\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring our manufacturing jobs back to Michigan; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars \u2013 made in Michigan \u2013 will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nTo the people of Michigan, I promise you this \u2013\nWe will make America wealthy again.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we will make America great again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","84":"\n\"Thank you! Whoa! Thank you so much. And I am so happy to be here in Coral Springs, in Broward County, in the great state of Florida! And I know there's a big overflow crowd in the next building over. I think they can see and hear us, but I wanted to thank them for being part of today's event.\nAnd I've got to recognize Joshua Simmons, who just introduced me. He is a civics teacher at Pompano Beach Middle School, and boy, are his students lucky to have him and his enthusiasm. And I want to also commend him for talking about his mother and how hard she worked, and his sister who he helped to raise. We really are stronger together, and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities.\nWell, you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you, starting with my great friend and former colleague, your Senator Bill Nelson. And I am looking forward to working with Bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together. And I sure hope Florida sends some reinforcements to the Senate and elect Congressman Patrick Murphy. I think Florida deserves a full-time senator, don't you? And I want to thank my friend, someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for Democrats across America \u2013 Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember \u2013 I'm so pleased he's here with us \u2013 Congressman Alcee Hastings. And I know that Congressman Ted Deutch, who represents this district \u2013 is over in Israel for the funeral of a great, great man, Shimon Peres, and I want to thank Ted for all of his support and his hard work.\nBefore I get started and really talk about everything that's at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election, I wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez. When he left Cuba, he did not speak a word of English. He didn't let that stop him. He pursued his dreams. He wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that Miami has ever seen. And he never forgot where he came from. He worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him. Jose's life really embodied the American dream, and at 24 years of age, he was just getting started. I'm sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family, with his fans, and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career.\nI also want to mention another resident of Coral Springs, and that's a man named Bob Levinson. My heart goes out to Bob's family. He disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago, and it is long past time for the Iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family.\nNow, did any of you see the debate the other night? Well, I think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of America that we want to have. My view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead. I believe America is an exceptional nation. My opponent believes America is in decline. I've never heard such a dark and divisive, terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the United States. When he talks, I lots of times don't even recognize the country he's talking about. And why are we already great? Well, it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military. It is because of our generosity; it is because of our ingenuity; it is because of the diversity of our country. I think our diversity is one of our strongest assets.\nThis morning, I laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve America, serve their communities. Because America is great, when you really strip it all down, because America is good. And we can't ever forget that.\nI have laid out specific plans about how we're going to make our country even greater. I've actually got a book here with Tim Kaine, my running mate. I have this old-fashioned idea: if I'm asking you for your vote for president, I should tell you what I'm going to do. I shouldn't just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do, but to lay out how we're going to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\nThat means new jobs \u2013 new jobs with rising incomes, jobs in infrastructure, jobs in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, and yes, clean, renewable energy jobs.\nMy opponent's only infrastructure plan is to build a wall. I love that he went down to Mexico and he choked. He didn't even raise it. He's been going around telling people for months, 'We're going to build a wall and we're going to make Mexico pay for it.' So he's sitting with the president of Mexico and he doesn't even bring it up. He finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall. I mean, really, who gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? I mean, he hurled as many insults as he could. Really, why does he do things like that? I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him. It proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief. I have said it before and I'll say it again: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.\nSo I'm going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election. Getting those new jobs. And I'll tell you, another area I want to emphasize is small business. As I said the other night, my dad was a small businessman. He made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good, solid, middle-class life. I'm really proud of that. And I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, who stiffs small businesses, doesn't pay his bills to people like my dad. But we need to do more to get small business started and growing \u2013 here in Broward County, throughout South Florida, across the state, and beyond.\nSo as we grow the economy, we also have to make it fairer. I want prosperity to reach everyone, not just the privileged few. So we are going to raise the minimum wage be-cause if you work full-time, you should not still be in poverty. And you know, two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, most of them supporting kids. And if you work full-time on a minimum wage job, at the end of the year you've made $15,000. I think we can do better. And I think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them.\nSomething else we're going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. Now, this is not, my friends, just a women's issue. If you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, who is working, it's your issue, too, to make sure she is paid fairly. That will raise family incomes.\nAnd then the third thing I want to do is to make sure \u2013 to make sure \u2013 more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place. The other night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. He was sitting in the front row. And one of the reasons I was proud to have him there is he believes in profit-sharing. He's always, in his companies, shared profits. And by the way, he is a real billionaire. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him, who helped to make him a success, became millionaires. I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that, not somebody who stiffs contractors, who doesn't pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else, but somebody who has the right attitude, that we're stronger together in business just like we are in government and America.\nAnd the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that American families are facing. It is hard to balance family and work, isn't it? I think we can do better. I want to see us have paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare, and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college.\nNow, after the primary was over \u2013 and Senator Sanders and I ran a tough primary, but you know what? I was really proud. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. He and I got together and we said, okay, what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education? Because right now, it's way beyond what a lot of families can afford. And if you go into debt, you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you.\nSo the other day Senator Sanders and I were up in New Hampshire together, and we were rolling out our plan. And it's pretty simple. You can go to my website, but let me just tell you briefly. If you are in a family that makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university. And if you make more than that, you will pay what you can afford, but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debt-free for you to go. And we put together a calculator on my website. You can go to hillaryclinton.com\/ calculator and you can see how much you will save, how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan.\nBut I also believe a four-year college degree, which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead, should not leave you mired in debt. So we are going to help you refinance your debt, get the interest rates down, and if you're willing to do public service, national service, we're going to forgive your debt over time.\nBut not everyone has to go for a four-year degree. I want every person, not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain \u2013 I want to everybody to have a chance for a good, solid job. I think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school. We need to put technical education back into high school.\nAnd we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job. And I want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs \u2013 not the kind that lead to being told, 'You're fired,' the kind that lead to being told, 'You're hired.'\nNow, I'm excited about this. I really am. I am confident and optimistic about our country. We never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else. That's not who we are as Americans. We need to lift ourselves up, and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country.\nAnd while we're doing that, we're going to make sure that our country's safe and that America provides strong and steady leadership around the world. Sometimes, when I listen to my opponent, it kind of seems he doesn't know who our friends are versus our adversaries. He has this weird fascination with dictators. He's kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list. He doesn't care whether NATO falls apart, and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons. He said he doesn't care. Let Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia, get a nuclear weapon. Whoa! That's the kind of dangerous, reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to.\nAs I told him in the debate \u2013 he actually said, 'Well, we may or may not defend our allies in Asia.' Words matter. And America's word matters. We have to be reliable and trustworthy. People have to count on us. And we've got a lot of work to do around the world. We need to work hard for peace and prosperity. We need to tackle climate change together.\nClimate change is real. Florida knows that. My opponent thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents. You see, some country's going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century. I think it's going to be either China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen. Let's deploy a half a billion more solar panels. Let's produce enough clean energy so that every home in America can be powered by it. There's so much we can do together. And that means we've got to work with other countries and we've got to demonstrate that we support our allies, whether they're in Europe, the Middle East with Israel, or Asia, that we stand with those who stand with us.\nAnd then, finally, one of the next priorities that I have if I am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together. I've got to tell you, look, disagreements, political disagreements, that's fine. That's who we are. I don't know any two people in America who agree on everything politically with each other. And I've known, been fortunate enough to know, a number of our more recent presidents. I didn't always agree with them either, including my husband. But I'll tell you this: Republicans and Democrats alike, I never doubt they were trying to put the country's interests first. They were trying to bring people together, not pit us against each other. And one of the things I will do from the very beginning, the very first day of my administration...\"\nAudience Member: \"Day one.\"\nClinton: \"...is to make them day one \u2013 you're right \u2013 is to make sure everybody in the country knows I'm the president of every American, every single per-son.\nNow \u2013 so in order for me to do any of this, anything that's in this book and making sure that it's paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally, all of that, depends upon whether we win in November. The stakes could not be higher. So here is what I am asking all of you. How many of you know you are registered to vote? So we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by October 11th. If you've moved, you may need to reregister. Here's how you can find out if you are registered. You can go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com. You put in your name. You put in your address and make sure you're registered. If you need to get registered, we have volunteers here. Right? And they will \u2013 they have \u2013 they have clipboards. We're kind of low-tech about it. They have clipboards. They can help you get registered right here and now or, as I say, you can go to iwillvote.com and check your registration. And, remember, you can vote by mail starting October 24th here in Broward. And the other thing you can do is convince everybody you know to make sure they're registered and to help them know how to vote by mail so they could get their vote in without making any fuss or inconvenience.\nSo make no mistake. This election is going to be close. They always are. So every call you make, every door you knock on, every person you register could make the difference. So I'm asking you to go ahead and text JOIN, text JOIN, J?O?I?N, to 47246 to get involved or go to hillaryclinton.com. And you can volunteer and become involved. If we win Broward County by as big a margin as we should win it, we win Florida.\nAnd, like I say, I'm not just excited about winning an election. I'm excited about doing the work. I'm excited about listening to Americans. I'll continue to travel our country. I'll be here in Florida so much you'll get sick of me because I want to be a good partner for Florida. I mean, Florida is already suffering from climate change, and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase. That's kind of hard to believe. So there's a lot we're going to do together: jobs, rising incomes, opportunities. And that's what gets me excited.\nSo here's what I hope you will do. When you leave here, if somebody says, 'Where were you this afternoon?' you say, 'Oh, I went to a rally for Hillary Clinton.' If they say, 'Oh, that's great,\" get them registered. If they say, 'Oh, my gosh. How can you do that?' if they're seriously thinking about voting for my opponent, stage an intervention, really, because, remember, remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. And what we believe and what we're going to prove on November 8th is love trumps hate. Thank you all so much.\"\n","85":"\n\"Hello! Thank you! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Wow, what \u2013 what a wonderful welcome. It is great to be here in Fort Pierce in this beautiful theater. I love being in the Sunshine State. I really want to recognize a few people: U.S. Congresswoman Lois Frankel is here as you saw, Randy Perkins, a candidate for Congress, Kim Johnson, chair of the St. Lucie County Commission, Larry Lee Jr., state representative. Everyone, all of the elected officials, all of the students and young people, it is wonderful to be with you.\nAnd I want to thank Eileen for her introduction. We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work, and now that she is retired, she is volunteering for our campaign. This woman never quit, and Eileen, we are so glad you are on our team.\nI am grateful to all of the elected officials, all of the commissioners, the county commissioners, Martin County, St. Lucie, for all you do for the community, but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water, that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses. This is a serious and complicated problem, isn't it, for the entire Treasure Coast. And it is a reminder, if we needed it, how important good leadership is. So, I thank all the leaders for their commitment.\nNow, there are just 39 days between now and November 8th. Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.\nWe've got to make every single day count. We have to get more people registered to vote, get more people committed to turn out to vote. We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families, safer communities and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth, this campaign really comes down to two questions. What kind of future we want for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, and how do we make it a reality?\nNow, as I said it the other night \u2013 how many of you saw the debate?\nWell as I said, I now have two grandchildren, and no offense to anybody, the two most wonderful, amazing, extraordinary. A little girl and a little boy. So I think a lot about the future. And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about \u2013 well, nearly everything when it gets right down to it \u2013 not just about what makes America great, because I think America already is great \u2013 but about what we should do to make it even greater, and about that basic question about how progress happens at all.\nMy opponent believes in what I call a 'strongman approach.' He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation. I am sorry, I am looking at you. I don't see that. That in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America I know. And here's what he said. He said, 'I alone can fix it.' I alone?\nWell, we have learned that that's his way. One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly. That's why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much. But that's not how change happens in America. It's never just one person, not even someone as powerful as the president. Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality. Not just the wealthy or the powerful \u2013 all of us.\nWe see that every day across America, and I bet many of you have been a part of it. Maybe you taught kids to read, right? Or cleaned up your local park, or the beach, maybe you have organized a cancer walk, or you have run a food drive. Whatever it is, chances are you have done something to serve your community. And by extension, your country.\nHow many of you \u2013 just think back over your lives \u2013 how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community, for other people. The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year. It's one of the best things about the American people. We are doers. We don't just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing, we don't get resigned or pathetic, or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats. We roll up our sleeves, we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood, our community, our city, our state, our country.\nThis has been our story, the American story, since the beginning of our nation, and it is still going strong today. Now, for many Americans, including a lot of you here, serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces.\nPeople are starting to call out their services!\nThere is no greater service or sacrifice, and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform, to their families and our veterans every single day. But what's so great is that national service can take many different forms, and it's something that I believe in so deeply, that every stage of our lives gives us the chance, from grade school through grandparenthood, to find a way to give back.\nWe've got folks here today from AmeriCorps, which my husband created back in 1993, and I'll tell you, to this day, it is one of his proudest achievements. Because very day, AmeriCorps volunteers are out there. They're building houses, responding to natural disasters, helping people with disabilities find jobs, find safe places to live, and next week, on October 7th, AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member. I'll tell you, Bill is really excited about this and so am I. And by the way, AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard. Here's how it starts: 'I will get things done for America.' Isn't that great? I think we should make that a national slogan.\nNow we also have folks here today from City Year, which is part of AmeriCorps. And every day, they're working with students who are risk of dropping out of school. They're tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs \u2013 all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school. I'm really grateful to them.\nWe also have people here today from the Peace Corps, which represents the best of America to the world. Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo, staffing health centers in Nicaragua, supporting farmers in Nepal, distributing malaria nets in Uganda. Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State, I got to see the results of their work first hand. They are making the world a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful place. Now, maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs, but I know you serve in different ways.\nMaybe you volunteer through your school, or with your church or synagogue. Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities, as I did when I was a teenager, service opportunities. Because for many Americans, service is part of our faith. My running mate, Tim Kaine, volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man, and it changed his life. Or maybe your whole family volunteers together, Bill and Chelsea and I, every holiday season, would work at a food bank back in Arkansas. However you serve, it feels good, doesn't it? To be part of something bigger than ourselves. To take our time and labor, and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world.\nAnd you know something very interesting? Service makes us happier, it makes us healthier, and there are studies proving that. It's not just how we feel, they've actually followed people. It can also help us find our next job, or our true calling in life. It's a smart way to use our greatest asset in life, our people. And service does something important for us as a society. Too often, we Americans can become separated from each other, and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election.\nIt's easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us, talk like us, look like us, read the same news as us, that's understandable to an extent. But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences, which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us. There aren't many places where people of all ages, all races, all backgrounds, all beliefs come together in common cause. But service is one of them, and that's one of the reasons I think it's so valuable, because in addition to the good work it does, it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life.\nI believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service, to help more Americans answer President Kennedy's call. You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.'\nBut sometimes it's hard to figure out. How do you make a difference, especially with everything else going on in our lives? And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do. But that's not how it should be. Everyone should be able to contribute.\nSo what if we, as a country, made it easier for everybody to do that, for everybody to give back? What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages, invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses? What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasn't just something that we did one day a year, but it became a regular part of our lives. I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America.\nI talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation. We're not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy. We're exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people.\nWay back, nearly 200 years ago, a Frenchman came to the United States, his name was Alexis de Tocqueville. He was travelling around, trying to figure out, 'What is this new place called America? They fought a revolution. Who are they?' And he saw how we had set up our government, and we had three branches, and everything that our founders really put into place. But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible. If I'm elected president this fall, I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service. So here's what I plan to do.\nFirst, let's triple AmeriCorps. That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy. It was laid out in a law named in his honor, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. It's finally time we get it done. Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program, so if we grow the program from 75,000 annual members to 250,000, we're going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so.\nThen I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service, and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can't afford it. So let's lighten that burden. If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans, because you are giving back to your country. And let's keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to.\nNow second, let's grow the Peace Corps. Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago, it's given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime, and it's fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations. We've got to do more of that in the world today. We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values, serving people. So let's make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program.\nThird, let's expand service opportunities for people of all ages. Right? Now, let's be fair, the younger generation is way ahead on this. I've talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world. Service isn't just something to do to check a box before graduation, it really is woven into your lives. And many who are just getting started in your careers, say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes, may pay a salary but doesn't give you any meaning or purpose in your lives.\nNow I also want to get older Americans more involved. Service isn't something only students and young people do. I know that. So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55. Let's give people an encore opportunity after they've ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community.\nAnd finally, I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious, meaningful ways without a full time commitment. AmeriCorps is a full time commitment. The Peace Corps is a full time commitment. The Armed Forces are a full time commitment. But the Armed Forces has another model. The Reserves \u2013 right? It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways. So let's do something like that in the civilian space. Let's call it the National Service Reserve.\nAnd here's the idea. If you join the National Service Reserve, you will receive some basic training, just like you would in the military reserves, and then when your city or state needs you, you'll get the call. Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck. Or maybe, like the crisis in Flint, and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families. Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health. You will then be sent into action. Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days, a month, some might be longer term. But they will directly address a vital need in your own community.\nAnd one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student, having a job, taking care of your family. You won't have to make service your only priority. Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states, and we will have an open door to people of all ages, but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 who've said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities, but they can't leave their jobs, understandably. We'll work with governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats, because I want this to be a true bipartisan, public-private partnership.\nI also want to include businesses, colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer. And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution, their schools and their employers will have their backs. I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states. There's so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it. So let's bridge that divide, get people working together in ways that can help communities.\nNow, I don't think you'll hear anything about this from my opponent. And you know what? I think that's a shame, because national service has always been a bipartisan goal. Of course, President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps \u2013 but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act. President George H.W. Bush created the White House Office of National Service. And both President George W. Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service. This should be something that we all can get behind. And when you listen to what's being said in this campaign, it can be discouraging, right? It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where, whenever we can. Now, I am well aware that candidates don't usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election. Some might say, 'Well hey, my gosh, you've only got 39 days to go. Why aren't you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it? Well, I'll do that, but \u2013 I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me. I'm trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart \u2013 and this is one of them.\nThank you!\nFor me, service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith, and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: 'Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.' Now, I've carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl, and it's an idea that really got into my head and my heart. But you know what's kept me going are the people that I've met. And in a country founded on liberty and equality, I can't think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable. We all deserve respect. We all should listen to each other. We all can make our mark on the world. And when we come together in common purpose, we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own.\nThat's why 'Stronger Together' is more than just a slogan. It's a course of action. So here's what I want to do. I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency. And I want you to help me bring our nation together \u2013 to solve our problems, strengthen our communities. To join with people across America who care about service, because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States. America is great because we are good. There are lots of examples. We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations. But I want everybody here to know that it can be done. We can do more, and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people.\nThere are so many examples in this community and communities across America \u2013 39 days left. This is the choice: do we lift each other up, or do we tear each other down? Do we listen and respect each other, or do we scapegoat, point fingers, and insult each other? Well, I'll tell you what side I'm going to be on, and with your help, we're going to demonstrate on November 8th, what kind of country we really are.\nThank you and God bless you!\"\n","86":"\nThank you. It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey.\nI've come to know and love the people of New Hampshire. You are strong, independent and you are free.\nWe are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.\nWe are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.\nWe are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American.\nWe are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\nWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.\nHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\nEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money.\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nFollow the money.\nThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nAgain, just follow the money.\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\nShe and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\nFavors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.\nShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale \u2013 and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power \u2013 to keep their control over this country.\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\nThe Clintons are the sordid past.\nWe are the bright future.\nWhile our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton \u2013 they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over \u2013 she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"\nSame thing goes for Hispanic voters \u2013 they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.\nA Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.\nEvery wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.\nWe will unleash the power of American energy \u2013 we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.\nCommon core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.\nThe catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.\nAnd the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.\nNAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton \u2013 and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved. You've lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\nHillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 which would destroy manufacturing in this state.\nHillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\nFrom now on, it's going to be America First.\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?\nThink about it. For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?\nAll the things you've ever wanted for your country have been denied.\nThe reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative.\nShe's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.\nShe's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors \u2013 we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\nThat includes keeping your family safe.\nNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.\nThe failed politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country. They just want me to go along with the status quo.\nWell, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.\nWe will never back down from fighting to save American lives.\nThat also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Hillary Clinton can't even say the words.\nWe are also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border. The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled \u2013 once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.\nI am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border \u2013 that is a promise.\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\nThey're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\nYou have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\nDo Not Let This Chance Slip Away.\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.\nHere is just some of the great things that will happen for your country:\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","87":"\n\"Thank you! Thank you all so much. Wow! I am so happy to be back here in Iowa on a beautiful fall day to see all of you. And I especially want to thank Janelle for her intro-duction. And I so appreciate that Janelle and Nora and her husband Stu are here today. I remember so well when I met her back in 2015, and I saw that sign. And my best friend from sixth grade was also going through breast cancer and being treated. And when I saw Janelle's sign, it just made me think about my friend, and I wanted to go over and meet this woman who had been through 13 chemo treatments already. And we just clicked. And I have been so grateful to be able to get to know her better and spend time with her when I see her. And I got to introduce her to my best friend when my best friend came to Iowa. So the circle is completed, and more people are reaching out and finding ways to help each other.\nNow, before I came out, I had the great, great privilege of saying hello to someone, Ruline Steininger, who is \u2013 is Ruline still here? I know she was going to try to stay. There she is. Hello, Ruline! Hello, Ruline! Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913. I am so grateful for her support, and I don't know if any of you have seen the videos, both about Janelle and about Ruline. But I really do recommend that you see them both. Ruline talks about this long, active life that she's had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world. And I think it's important to have that perspective. So it's a great honor to have Ruline supporting me. I am so pleased. And she's going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts.\nI want to thank Dr. Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party, fighting so hard to elect Democrats. And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate, Patty Judge. Where's Patty? Patty's out there fighting hard every single day, and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate. And Jim Mowrer, the 3rd District congressional candidate. Jim is running a great campaign, and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington. But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa.\nNow, while we're meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines, I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding. I talked with the mayor. I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so. They hope that they will not have the flooding. They took a lot of good precautionary measures. Our campaign, along with thousands of people, came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding. And I told them that if I'm so fortunate enough as to be president, we're going to have a big infrastructure program, and we're going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids.\nNow, I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey. That's very personal to me. I live in New York. People commute into New York from New Jersey. We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died. I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because it's a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage. So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today.\nNow, we are starting to vote in Iowa today! And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin, and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today. And we have, what, 40 days, 39 days, left. And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path. We have 40 days to win an election that's going to affect the next 40 years of our country. And you, every one of you, can make the difference in this election.\nNow, how many of you participated in the caucuses? Well, we've got a bunch of active Iowans here. Are you ready to go to the polls? Well, luckily, in Iowa you can start today. Lots of folks don't have that opportunity across the country. And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites. We've got one right down the street. So when you finish here, you can go vote. And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa.\nAny of you see that debate on Monday night? Well, one down, two to go. Well, I have to tell you, it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something, not just against somebody. And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago, fighting for kids and families because it's been the cause of my life. It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America. And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work, their talent, will take them.\nNow, you may have heard me say this. I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa. But I was very fortunate. None of us picks our parents. But I really was fortunate. My dad was a Navy veteran, a small businessman, and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security, a good, solid, middle class life. And I know how hard he worked because occasionally I'd go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies. And it was not a very big building. It didn't have any natural life. There were no windows in it. It's what he could afford.\nAnd there were two long tables. And he'd roll out the fabric, and then he would take a silkscreen. Any of you ever seen a silkscreen, an old-fashioned silkscreen? Not far from here there's a wonderful t-shirt store. Right? And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing. So he would take that silkscreen, and he'd put it down, and he would pour the paint in. Then he'd take a squeegee and he'd go across it. And then he'd lift it up, and he'd go all the way down the table. And if there was going to be more than one color, he'd do it all over again. And then when he finished, he would gather it up and put it in his car and he'd go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it.\nThat's how I was raised to think about doing business. You do your best. You enter into a contract or an agreement. Somebody orders your goods or your services. And then they pay you for it. Right? And as I said the other night, one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him, Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy. Her words. And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts, to pay what had been bargained for. I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldn't have survived all that.\nAll that work, and then to be told we're not going to pay you, or maybe we'll pay you 10 cents on the dollar, or 20 cents? That's just wrong. What kind of person does that, takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people? We've been looking into the records, and there's a long list of people who have been mistreated. I just don't believe that's the way we're supposed to treat each other in America. And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country.\nNow, my mom had a very different story. My dad's father was a factory worker, but they had a strong family. My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents, and they didn't want her. So she was out on her own by the age of 14. She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter. And it may sound harsh, but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other. So for her, it was a gift.\nAnd then she got another gift. The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school. And so the woman said, 'If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school, you can go to high school. But you'll have to come right back.' That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old, but for my mother it made all the difference. And that's exactly what she did for four years, and most days she had to run \u2013 run \u2013 to get there. But she didn't care because she wanted to get an education.\nSo when I learned more about my mom's life, I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families, and especially for kids who've been left out or left behind in some way. That's why I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then, and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law, and boy, every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin, who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career.\nSo that's been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families? And so when I talk about the economy \u2013 because I think we have three big issues facing us. Number one, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, right? We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership, in accordance with our values. And we need to bring our country together. We have to heal these divides.\nBut when I think about the economy, yes, I want more new, good jobs with rising in-comes. I see my friends from the laborers here. We need to do work that builds our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our tunnels, our water systems, our sewer systems. This is good, honorable work, and boy, do we have a lot of it in America. We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents \u2013 and sometimes even great-grandparents \u2013 made. If we're going to have a competitive economy, we need to be building America again. And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing. And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa. I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that I've seen anywhere in the country. And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers, and as designers using 3-D printing. I was so impressed. And I think we need to do that across America. And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools. It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools.\nAnother way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what you've done with clean renewable energy. Now, it wasn't a partisan issue in Iowa. It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor, Tom Vilsack. But it's been continued over the years. And look at the results. Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources, most particularly wind. Right? And look at the number of jobs \u2013 it's nearly 10,000 jobs now that are related to that. Plus the renewable fuel standard, which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material. I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future, and I'm excited by that.\nI'm running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I know it's real. I believe in science. But I'll tell you what else is real. What's real are the economic opportunities, the new jobs and businesses we're going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change, and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that. Now, we also need to help small businesses. Iowa is filled with small businesses. It should be easier to start one, it shouldn't be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations. We're going to try to streamline that process. Being the daughter of a small businessperson, I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands. And we're going to work hard. I want to be a first-class small business president, in honor of my dad, and I'm going to do everything I can to help you get started, and grow small businesses.\nBut while we're growing the economy, we need to make it fairer. And here are a couple of things I want to do. Let's raise the national minimum wage, so people who work full-time are not still in poverty. I've met \u2013 you know, two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women \u2013 and I've met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America. Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs, because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15,000 at the end of a full-time year of work. We also could give the biggest boost to incomes, and particularly family incomes, if we finally guaranteed equal pay for women's work.\nAnd the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing, so if you helped to create the profits, all of you, not just the top executives, will be able to share in those profits. You know, at the debate the other night, one of my well-known supporters, Mark Cuban, was there in the front row. And he really, I think, unsettled my opponent. But I'll tell you, Mark Cuban's a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing, and not only while the business is ongoing, but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold, he shared the profits with all of his employees. 300 employees became millionaires, because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company, all together.\nAnd the final point I want to make about this is about family economics. You know, let's tackle the cost of childcare. Between 2000 and 2012, childcare costs went up 25 percent. Incomes barely budged, right? So we're going to increase federal investment, and provide more tax relief to working families, so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare. Now, if you don't have small children or grandchildren right now, you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities. A lot of families are just so stressed out.\nThe other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies, and provide paid family leave, so you can take care of your family members. Now, a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies, adopted babies, and of course that's a big part of it. Last year, in Newton, a mom said to me, I'm counting on you to know what it's like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work. Right?\nThat's a lot of you. There you are. Okay. And I've got to tell you, I hear that all over. When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter, I was talking to one of the nurses, and I said, so what is your biggest worry? She said, well, my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work. Right back to work. But it's not just for babies. It's for sick children, sick spouses, elderly members of your family who are having health problems. There is nothing more important than caring for each other. And I will tell you, it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families.\nThe other big expense for family economics is education. Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools, no matter what zip code they live in, right? And we also have to make college affordable. Yesterday in New Hampshire, I was with my friend and my former opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders. I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran. It was a campaign about issues, not insults. And we shared a lot of the same goals, even though we have different ways of getting there. And so after it was over, he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together. And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125,000 or less. And to make it debt-free for everybody else, so that you only pay what you can afford to pay, without going into debt.\nNow, right now, Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans. An education should give you a boost, not hold you back. And we're going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt. We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America, 300,000 of them right here in Iowa. We're going to help you refinance. It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent, a car payment at 2 percent, and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8, 10, 12 percent interest on their student loans. I'll tell you what. I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations.\nAnd college is crucial, but this is not said often enough. Four-year college is not, and should not, be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life. So we're going to have real apprenticeships, not the kind where you're told, 'you're fired,' but the kind where you're told, 'you're hired.' We're going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill.\nSo I'm excited about what we can do together. I know so much of this campaign has been about, you know, whatever my opponent says, and who he attacks, and who he derides and denigrates. And the list is long. But it's not about that. It's about you. It's about your families and your futures, and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job. Now, I have this old-fashioned idea. I'm asking for your vote. I should tell you what I'm going to do, what my plans are. So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book. And I see somebody holding one in the front row. It's called, not surprisingly, 'Stronger Together.' You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport, wherever they sell paperbacks. And you can see what we're trying to do, and where we're going to get the money to pay for it. And the simple answer to that is, we're going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America.\nNow, my friends, my opponent has a very different vision for America. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes, maybe not paying any taxes at all. And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America. Calling us a third world country. Saying our military is a disaster. That everything about America is in bad shape. But then it's probably true, he hasn't paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military, or our vets, or our schools, or our roads, or our education systems. He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes. He says that makes him smart.\nWell, I'll tell you what, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make the rest of us? My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public. You can go and look at them, and you can see that we've been blessed, and we're grateful for that. But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates, and we are glad we could, because we have both benefited from this great country of ours, and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that.\nDonald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9. Think about that. Five million families lost their homes. And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it. He even said that it is just business. Well, what kind of person believes that \u2013 that throwing people out of their homes, foreclosing on them, destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business? Well, I'll tell you, that's a person who should never be president because they don't understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it.\nSo look, I think after \u2013 Thank you. I think after what we saw Monday night, we'll have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare. I have no idea what he's going to say the next time. But you know, I will spend some time preparing for it.\nBut we can't do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help. The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot. It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited, divisive, bigoted things that are being said in our country. We can have our differences, for heaven sakes. We're Americans; that's in our DNA. But we should respect one another. We should listen to one another. That's the way we're going to get things done together.\nAnd so I want you to join this campaign. The election will be close, but we can win Iowa and we're going to win on November 8th. So if you can, text 'Join,' J-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. If you're not sure if you're registered, see these signs, 'I Will Vote?' Iwillvote.com. You can go to iwillvote.com, put in your name and your address, to make sure you're registered.

And then, vote, and get everybody you know to vote. And I hope that a lot of you will go to vote after today, after this beautiful rally we're having. Because we will prove that we are stronger together. And you know what else we'll prove? We will prove that love trumps hate.\nThank you all very much.\"\n","88":"\nThank you. I always look forward to coming back to Iowa, a state where I have so many friends \u2013 including your incredible governor, Terry Branstad.\nWe are doing so well in Iowa, a recent Reuters poll had us up by 10 points.\nOn November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nIt's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.\nWe are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.\nWe are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\nLower taxes, less regulation, more affordable childcare, fair trade deals, secure borders, thriving family farms, and millions and millions of new jobs.\nWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.\nHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for insiders.\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\nEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\nShe received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\nAnd don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton \u2013 or all the favors and access granted to those who wrote checks. She even gave up 20% of American Uranium to Russia.\nShe disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\nWe can't let that happen. That's why you have to go out and vote on November 8th, and early voting in Iowa starts tomorrow.\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\nThe Clintons have perfected the politics of profit.\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy \u2013 they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\nThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton. That's why Hillary Clinton is pushing for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power \u2013 to keep their control over this country.\nThe American people have had it with corrupt Clinton ways. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\nHow many more Clinton scandals can this country take - one after another after another? They are the sordid past. We are the bright future.\nWhile our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.\nNever in American history have so many serious challenges been met with so unserious a campaign as the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\nIt's time for real change \u2013 a new foreign policy, a new economic policy, a new immigration policy, a new trade policy.\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton \u2013 they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over \u2013 she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"\nSame thing goes for Hispanic voters \u2013 they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.\nHillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\nFrom now on, it's going to be America First.\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?\nWhy can't we have the schools we want, and the borders we want, and the security we want? Why can't we have policies that support small business, or family farms, or the miners and the steelworkers?\nThe answer is simple. Because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors.\nLook at her career. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on Russia, on China, on North Korea.\nShe failed upstate New York.\nShe failed the inner cities.\nShe's failed women and children. I've created thousands of jobs for women in this country, of incredible talent. Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and now 70 million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty.\nAnd she has been a disaster on our borders.\nI'd like to invite on up here Michelle Root, the mother of Sarah Root, who was killed by an illegal immigrant released into the country under the Obama catch-and-release policies championed by Hillary Clinton.\nHillary Clinton supports Sanctuary Cities. Where was the Sanctuary for Sarah?\nThe only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors. Just Follow The Money.\nHer single greatest achievement may be getting away with her massive e-mail scandal and criminal cover-up.\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors \u2013 we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\nThat includes keeping your family safe.\nNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.\n60% of murder victims under the age of 22 in this country are African-American.\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in poverty.\nI will never back down from fighting to save American lives.\nI will never back down from fighting to create safety and wealth for our inner cities.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe will cut your taxes, reduce regulations \u2013 including on our farmers \u2013 negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWe are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child \u2013 including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America.\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Remember: Follow the Money.\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\nThey're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\nGovernment will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.\nAn article in the New York Post was published recently called \"How Donald Trump helped save New York City.\"\nThe article said, quote: \"Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out\u2026 Trump \u2014 almost by force of will \u2014 rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\"\nThat's what I want to do for our country \u2013 I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th \u2013 and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is so important.\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\nYou have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","89":"\nThank you.

Thank you all so much. It is great being here on the stage at UNH with my friend Bernie Sanders, one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone who I am looking forward to working with to get [cheers] the kind of agenda through our Congress that will begin to make our country stronger by providing the kind of support that working families and middle class families so richly deserve.\nBernie's campaign energized so many young people, some of you in this crowd. And there is no group of Americans who have more at stake in this election than young Americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives, your jobs, the kind of country we are, the kind of future we want to build together.\nI'm proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran. We ran a campaign about issues, not insults. And when it was over, we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education, in health and so much else. Thank you, Bernie. Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for your support in this campaign.\nNow, we're going to need some help in Washington. And I hope New Hampshire will send your now Governor Maggie Hassan to Washington as your senator. And I sure hope you will send Carol Shea Porter back to Washington.\nIsn't this one of the strangest elections you've ever seen? I \u2013 I really sometimes don't know what to make of it. Standing on that debate stage the other night, I was especially thinking about that. And, look, I have been very clear about what I want to do if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president. And Americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that we're not only electing a president, we're electing a commander-in-chief. We're looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world.\nI was very honored today to earn the endorsement of John Warner, a retired Republican senator, World War II veteran, former \u2013 former secretary of the Navy who served under two Republican presidents. I served with him on the Senate Armed Services Committee. And I have the deepest respect for his patriotism. And it's a great honor. He's never endorsed a Democrat for president before. And I'm also very grateful that a number of Republicans and Independents here in New Hampshire have announced their support for this campaign. In fact, it is really an extraordinary honor that 150 Republicans here in New Hampshire are supporting this campaign because they understand how high the stakes are.\nThe next \u2013 the next 40 days will determine the next 40 years. So I'm going to close my campaign the way I started my public service and my career: fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. And it will be the mission of my presidency. And when you go to vote in November or if you vote early, it's not just my name on the ballot. Every issue you care about, think about it because, in effect, it's on the ballot, too. It's whether or not we continue to fight climate change or we give in to denial. This is a big deal. I never thought when I gave my acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention that I would have to put in the following sentence, 'I believe in science.' Climate change is real. It's serious. And we have to be united and committed in addressing it. I never thought I'd hear someone running for president, my opponent, who says he wants to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on LGBT Americans, overturn a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more.\nSo there's a lot at stake. And that's why some of the analysts are saying more Americans will vote in this election than ever before. We had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before. And that's why we have to focus on what we want to do because I want to make a difference in your lives.\nAnd one of the biggest issues that I heard about throughout the campaign that I hear about from every corner of our country is how much an education costs. Bernie is absolutely right. I remember when I went to college, my dad, who was a small business man \u2013 he had saved up money, but I had to work. I had to work through college, work during the school year, work during summers, but that was okay. We were able to put it together. It wasn't so much that it endangered me or my family's financial future.\nAnd then I decided to go to law school, and my dad said, 'Well, I can't help you. That \u2013 we're done. We can't help you.' So I kept working. I got a small scholarship, but then I took out loans. And I paid those loans back. But I was lucky because I signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my in-come, not a fixed interest rate. That's why I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I think I made $14,000 a year, as I recall. I could never have done that if I had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing.\nIt's absolutely wrong, and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams, to have that education, to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve.\nNow, New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the second-highest average debt per student. As a student I met here in New Hampshire said, going to college should be hard, but paying for college shouldn't be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education.\nIndeed, here in New Hampshire, we've got so many young people graduating with debt who aren't able to get started in their careers, aren't able to do the jobs like I could do, because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down. So we should, and we will, make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year.\nAnd if you already have student debt, like so many students have here in New Hamp-shire, we will help you refinance it. It is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt, and it is even worse that you're being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house, to buy a car, to borrow money for a business. I don't know how we got to where we are, but we are going to fix it. This is wrong. It's wrong for students, it's wrong for families, and it's wrong for our country.\nI also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business. They want to be entrepreneurs. It's the classic American story; start that business in the garage or the basement; get going. But they can't get credit because they have student debt. Nobody will help them out, no matter how good the idea is. So we're going to put a moratorium, so you don't have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started, and you get the chance to get the credit you need.\nWe are also \u2013 we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service. And in Florida on Friday I'll give a speech about why that is so important.\nNow, when you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars. Our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you, not in general, but really specifically you, the situation you're in. To check it out, go to hillaryclinton.com\/calculator.\nNow, we have an example right here, and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website. You can say, 'I have student debt,' you can say, 'I am planning for college,' you can put in what your annual household income is, how much you will save, and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because I don't want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you. You can choose whether you have student debt.\nI met a young woman just yesterday in North Carolina who said, 'Nobody really ex-plained to me and my family what I was getting into.' I hear that so much. You know, these financial aid forms, one is called FAFSA, it takes forever to fill out, and at the end of it you really don't know what it means? Well, we're going to be really explicit. You know, we do have technology in America. And we ought to use it more to help people understand what they're getting into and to provide alternatives so that they don't make the wrong decisions for themselves.\nSo, please, use this, you know? You will save $60,640 if you're in one of these categories. But there is a way to understand the choices you have to make for everybody. So I hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com\/calculator.\nBut I have to say this: none of this will happen if you all don't turn out and vote. None of it. You know, I see all the signs saying, 'I will vote.' There is also a website. Please go to iwillvote.com to make sure you're registered. All the information is there. You put in your name, you put in your address, and through the miracle of technology you can find out if you're registered, or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again. New Hampshire makes it easy. You can have same-day registration.\nSo both Bernie and I are excited about what we can do together. I am really looking forward to working with him and other strong Democrats and Republicans who want to help solve problems again in America. Bringing people together is what I'm going to spend a lot of my time doing as your president. And if you've had a chance to see or meet my running mate, Tim Kaine, you know how hard he'll work to get things done and make it a high priority to produce results.\nSo we're going to move now to the panel, and I'm very pleased to have Mary Jo Brown moderating, along with Doug Martin, who you heard from earlier. I know they have collected up questions from the crowd. But I will end by saying that I'm excited about what we can do to make college affordable, and especially as Bernie rightly said, open the doors to families and young people who have been left out. We also want to make Pell grants once again available year-round, and we want to make sure that we have \u2013 specific help for certain groups of students.\nI'll end with this story. I taught at the University of Arkansas Law School some years ago, and I met a lot of students, not only in the law school but students on campus. I'd go and eat with them and go to events with them, and I met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money, but then something happened. You know, maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart. Maybe they had to drive to and from school; they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation. Or maybe they had a health emergency. And they would come and they would say to me, 'What can I do? Where can I get the $300 to fix the car? Where can I find childcare? How can I pay the doctor's bills?'\nAnd I realized that we've got to take care of tuition, making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school. We've got to make sure costs and expenses, Pell grants and other ways of helping. But we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students. So I helped to start something called the Arkansas Single-Parent Scholarship Fund, because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents, mostly, but not always, single moms, young, divorced, pretty much on their own, trying to improve their lives and prospects.\nAnd we started a fund to help fill those gaps, and, you know, we did it over so many years now, about 35 years, and we've helped thousands of people, so they didn't have to drop out. They didn't have to cut back. That's what I want for our country again, where we're helping each other, where we're reaching out and giving everybody a chance, and, yes, sometimes a second or third chance, to make the most of their lives, to pursue their dreams. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody, and education is absolutely essential to it.\nSo please make sure you come out and vote in this election. Thank you, all.\"\n","91":"\n\"Thank you! Boy! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Did anybody see that debate last night? Oh, yes. One down, two to go. I am so excited to be back here at Wake Tech. I was here 8 years ago, and I was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like Christine that I wanted to come back, of course, to Raleigh, but I wanted to come back here to Wake Tech. When Christine was talking, I was backstage watching her on a screen we had there. And she kept saying about how she was about to cry. I was about to cry. Her story says so much, not just about her but about our country. We are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them, get up every day, do their best. That's the basic bargain of America. And I was really proud of Christine.\nAudience Member: We're proud of you!\nClinton: Thank you. Thank you. And I think her \u2013 I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality, that get-up-and-go personality, is going to mean a lot to the people she's taking care of. So Christine, thank you and Godspeed.\nNow, I have to thank \u2013 I have to thank Dr. Stephen Scott, the president of Wake Tech Community College, all the administrators, the faculty, and the students of Wake Tech. Now, Dr. Scott told me that the enrollment's about 73,000. And what a tribute to what this institution represents. And I am a huge, huge supporter. I just see America differently. I think there's nothing we can't do if we make our minds up, roll up our sleeves, get working together, support institutions like Wake Tech, support people like Christine. And that's what I intend to do.\nNow, I want to thank your mayor, Mayor McFarlane. Thank you so much for being here. State Senator Dan Blue, Jr. I also want to recognize Linda Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina. Linda came so close last time. And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line? And I'll tell you somebody else I'm really excited about. That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, former State Representative Deborah Ross. I have watched \u2013 I have watched the campaign she's run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it. I'll tell you what, we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here, and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husband's and mine, somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship. That's former Governor Jim Hunt.\nNow, there's a lot that I want to talk about today. But let me start with this because you may or may not know. Today is National Voter Registration Day. And you see some signs people are holding. 'I Will Vote.' Now, that's not only a great sign that shows you're committed to vote, but it's a website. And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered. And I hope you all will, and I hope you'll tell everybody that you know to do the same, because we want to make sure people are registered.\nAnd there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina, and I hope that you will, because think about everything that's at stake in this election right here in North Carolina. The very mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state. But more than that, it's hurt people. It has sent a message to so many people that, well, you're not really wanted. You're not really part of us. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.\nThe other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people. Now, they were pretty blatant about it. Make it harder for people of color. Make it harder for the elderly. And make it harder for the young. Now, some of that's been rolled back, thankfully, because it was so wrong and, I would argue, unconstitutional. But the best way to show, hey, in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous, vibrant debate, that's what it's about. But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote. That's the way we're supposed to be making decisions. It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that.\nNow, I have won elections and I have lost elections, so I know what the difference is. But I'll tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us, to govern ourselves, to continue to widen the circle of opportunity, and that includes the opportunity to be heard, to express yourself, your voice and your vote. And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote, and demonstrate the importance of your vote.\nI believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election. Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout we've ever had. Now, that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future, and who we are fighting for. But early information is actually quite encouraging. We're seeing spikes in early voting. And we're seeing voting rates among African Americans, Latinos, and young people going up. And for the first time, the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote.\nNow, I would love to see that. Obviously, I hope people vote for me. But I would love to see that because every election is about the future. And honestly, it's more about the future of young people and children than it's ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent.\nNow, last night I got a chance \u2013 I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president. And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do. And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren.\nAnd I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren. I think about that a lot, in part because I started out working for the Children's Defense Fund. It's always been my passion about what we can do [applause] to help more kids live up to their God-given potential.\nAnd during this campaign, people have asked me, 'Well, how did you get interested in that?'And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood. She was basically abandoned by her parents, sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her. By the age of 14, she was out on her own working in a home babysitting, keeping house. She was basically a maid. And when I think about my mother's own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers, she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people.\nWe overlook the importance of just how we treat each other, the respect we show, the kindness, the love that we show. And I'm well aware that's not something you put necessarily on a campaign website, but I've been talking about it because I think we've got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other.\nWhen my mother was in first grade, she never had any food, and her first grade teacher noticed that. In those days, they just brought food, a little bag of food, then they'd sit in the classroom and eat it, and my mother never had any food. And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her. She would say, 'You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food. Would you like this sandwich? Would you like this milk?' And it wasn't until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year, something she didn't have to do, but her love for her students, her recognition of a child who wasn't well taken care of meant that she stepped in.\nAnd then when my mother worked as a maid, she really wanted to go to high school. She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents' home. And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school, and so she said to her, 'If you get up early \u2013 it sounds like Christine getting up so early. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.' And that's what my mother did for four years, she got up early and then she literally had to run, run to get to high school. It sounds harsh, but not for my mom. She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live, gave her food to eat, gave her the chance to go to high school.\nSo when I talk about us being stronger together, I'm not just talking about what our government needs to do, I'm talking about what each of us can do to contribute. We do need to make sure \u2013 we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top, and that means we've got to make investments in more good, new jobs, infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, technology and innovation, clean renewable energy jobs. And we've got to do more to help small businesses because that's where most of the new jobs will come from.\nAs I said last night, my dad was a small businessman. When he got out of the Navy after World War II, he started this small business printing drapery fabrics, and he had a print plant in Chicago. It was just \u2013 it was dark room. There was no natural light. He had two long tables and he'd spread that fabric on the table, and then he would take silkscreens \u2013 if you've ever seen one \u2013 and he'd start at one end and he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, and he'd take the squeegee and he'd lift it up and he'd go all the way down to the end of one table, and then he'd start on the other table, and he would do that until he got the job done. And I would help him out from time to time, so I knew how hard he worked. But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker. And so he was able to do what we want to see in America, keep going, keep reaching, move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you.\nSo I want us to have an economy that works for everyone, to grow the economy, to create more jobs, but I also want a fairer economy because \u2013 when you work hard, you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year. But if you are a minimum wage worker, if you work full time minimum wage, you will make $15,000 a year. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, most of them with families to support. And I've talked to a lot of these women. Sometimes I'll be at a caf\u00e9 or sometimes I'll be in a store and I'll just start talking to them, and they will tell me \u2013 it's one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you're open to it, folks will tell you what's on their minds and their hearts.\nSo I've met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids. So we need to raise the national minimum wage and \u2013 and we need to guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work because \u2013 number one, it's fair. It's fair. And if your mother, your wife, your sister, or your daughter is working, don't you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?\nAnd the other thing I want to do, I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place. It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives. I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work.\nAnd last night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. Now, Mark Cuban, who is a real billionaire, by the way, he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business, and he not only used it while the business was going, but when the business was sold. He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight.\nNow, that's the kind of business leadership I want to hold up, because what we've seen from my opponent is someone, who his own campaign manager has said, builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy, stiffing people \u2013 dishwashers, painters, plumbers, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers \u2013 across America. Some of them have come forward. You can go to our website; you can see their stories. It's heartbreaking. And as I said last night, I'm really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business.\nAnd in addition to making the economy fair, we've got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work. It's really hard out there, isn't it? And just listening to Christine's story \u2013 getting up at 4:00 and studying, getting kids up at 7:00, going to school, going to work, going to another job \u2013 that's not an uncommon story. We've made it really hard for a lot of people.\nSo here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity \u2013 because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them. And I've heard so many stories. They've told me \u2013 people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under. So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones. And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick. And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm. And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget.\nNow, tomorrow in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary. And I want \u2013 I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way. And we're also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner.\nNow, how are we going to do that? Well, we're going to go where the money is, and the money is at the top. We're going to go after millionaires, billionaires and corporations. We're going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, and we're going to close corporate loopholes. And I believe that we can get that done, in part because you're going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so we're going to have another Democratic senator. But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again \u2013 not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence. That hasn't worked out so well. We've got to get back to first principles. Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go. Let's be a government for the struggling, the striving and the successful.\nSo I'm excited about what we can do. I really am. And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of \u2013 all of Donald Trump's claims. There were \u2013 there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night. But here's a couple of things that caught my attention. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years. And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets. But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.\nAnd when I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns \u2013 and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he's paid zero \u2013 he said that makes him smart. Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed. We didn't come from millionaire families. My husband's father \u2013 his biological father died before he was born. His mother went to nursing school in order to support him. They struggled. They worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President. My dad, as I told you, worked hard.\nSo Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years. And if you look, you'll see that we paid the highest marginal rate. We tried to give 10 percent to charity. Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we've been given, we should do our part.\nThe other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen. I don't think I'd make a big bragging point out of that. But he seemed to feel like, hey, it shows you how smart I am. He basically said, 'Yeah, if the housing market crashes, I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money.' I got to tell you, what kind of person believes that? What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question.\nAnd he made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate. At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared. But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort. And I said, 'Yeah. You know what? I did prepare. And I'll tell you something else I prepared for. I prepared to be president of the United States, and I think that's good.'\nSo as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here. I believe we are stronger together. That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service. I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater. I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners. I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues. I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS. And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying.\nBut words matter. And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia, \"Hey, we're not sure we're going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty.\" Words matter. People here that and they start to doubt America's word, America's intention. I felt like I had to jump in and say, 'I just want to be clear. We will honor our treaties. We will support our allies and our partners.'\nThis is not reality TV. This is real. It's as real as it gets. so we're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We're going to keep America safe, provide strong, steady leadership, and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other. Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night, are they? There's still a lot we don't know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte, but this we do know: We've got to bring communities together. We have to listen to each other. We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect, and respect for the law from the communities that are protected.\nAnd we've got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country. Again, I think we can come together. A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks. They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do. They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do. But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them.\nSo there's work to do. But it's great work. It's important work, starting right here in North Carolina. We have 42 days left. This election's going to be close. They all are these days. That's why every call you make, every door you knock on, every friend you register to vote, to make the difference. I want you, if you can, to text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina. And I know there's a big overflow room, and I'm told they can hear me, so to my friends in the overflow, we want you to be just as involved as anyone else. Thank you for coming.\nSo remember, here in North Carolina, starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. And remember, it's not just the presidential race. It's the governor's race, the lieutenant governor's race, the U.S. Senate race, and other races up and down the ticket. Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election. We're not fearful. We don't want to build walls. We want to build bridges. We don't want to turn against each other. We want to work with one another. We want to set big goals again here in our country.\nI've got some big goals that I know we can achieve. Take climate change, which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen, and I want us to take advantage of that. Do the right thing and benefit from it. That's what I'm offering. We're going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration. And we will produce enough clean power to power every home in America within 10 years. And we're going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Now, the way things are stacking up, I think it's either going to be Germany, China, or us. I want it to be us and it will be us.\nThat is exactly right. I love this country. I'm proud of this country. I want to be a leader who brings people together in our country, sets those goals, gets about the business of achieving them, and proves once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you!\"\n","92":"\nThank you. It's wonderful to be here in Virginia, a state where I have so many great friends and wonderful employees.\nTremendous polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.\nOn November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nWe are going to take on the big donors, and big business, and big media \u2013 we are going to take on the rigged system that has shipped America's wealth to other countries.\nWe are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nWe will cut taxes for all working and middle-class households in America.\nWe will reduce regulations, which will put more money into the hands of our poorest workers and bring thousands of new companies to our shores.\nWe will unleash American energy, creating millions of new jobs and lowering energy costs. The Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are nothing more than a massive tax on the poor \u2013 we will remove those restrictions day one.\nWe will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\nPresident Obama promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.\nOur replacement plan includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it. It includes allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines in all 50 states, creating a dynamic and competitive new market \u2013 they will be competing for your business.\nWe're also going to block grant Medicaid so states can develop innovative solutions to make sure no citizen in poverty ever falls through the cracks. High-risk pools will also help to ensure that those with pre-existing conditions will always get the quality coverage they need.\nOn trade, we are going to end the international abuse, the foreign cheating, and the one-sided rules that govern NAFTA and the World Trade Organization. Right now, America eliminates its tariffs, but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their markets.\nOur massive, chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class \u2013 and shifting money away from workers to large corporations who have no borders. There's a reason hedge funds and Wall Street are giving tens of millions to my opponent.\nHillary Clinton is the voice for the global special interests.\nI am running to be the voice of the forgotten men and women.\nMy opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been \"fighting for women.\" That she has been \"fighting for children.\"\nWhy then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, \"Watch what I do, not what I say.\"\nAt the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.\nAnd just last week, joined by my daughter, Ivanka, I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare. That plan has many great features, including tax-free childcare savings accounts. Low-income parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts, and then get a $500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts deposits.\nFamilies can also deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes, a huge tax cut for the middle class.\nWe have also talked about improving education. My plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child in America.\nWe are also going to bring down the cost of college.\nUniversities get massive federal funds, and huge tax breaks for their endowments \u2013 but then they don't spend those funds or those endowments on their students. I will work with Congress to make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin to reduce tuition and student debt. This will get to the problem at the source, and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers. Our students are drowning and we're going to fix it.\nWomen also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, stop the massive inflow of refugees, protect our borders, and who will reduce the rising crime and violence in our cities.\nAs I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.\nBut even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.\nThis must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.\nThe changes will start immediately.\nHere, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy. Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work. Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.\nBy the way, less than a week after taking office, Tim Kaine proposed a $4 billion dollar tax hike in Virginia, including on people earning as little as $17,000 dollars a year.\nWe are going to open up all sources of American energy and bring jobs, wealth, and cheaper electricity to Virginia.\nAnother major part of our agenda is safety.\nI believe every family in America is entitled to live in safety and peace.\nToday, the nation just opened the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture. We congratulate and honor those involved with the project, and recognize today the incredible contributions of the African-American community to this nation.\nAfrican-Americans have given so much to this nation and sacrificed so much for this nation.\nMany African-Americans are succeeding so greatly in our country, and I will make sure their success is protected and supported.\nAt the same time, too many African-Americans have been left behind and trapped in poverty.\nI will fight to make sure every single African-American child in this country is fully included in the American Dream.\nThat includes the new civil rights issue of our time: School Choice.\nDemocrats have run the inner cities for half a century or more, and produced only more joblessness and poverty.\nThe jobs are leaving, the schools are failing, and crime is rising.\nTo those suffering, I say: Vote for Donald Trump. What do you have to lose? I will fix it. I will fight harder for you than anyone has before.\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have brought only suffering in our inner cities \u2013 just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she went.\nOf course, she got rich through it all \u2013 the Clintons made another $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State.\nWorst of all, she put her public office up for sale \u2013 and then bleached her emails, and destroyed her phones, to try to cover her tracks following a congressional subpoena.\nThere's a reason the hedge fund managers are donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign \u2013 and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.\n95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you.\nOur campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same political establishment.\nThey go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America \u2013 and America First.\nTogether, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.\nGovernment will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity \u2013 where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.\nWe turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.\nThat's what I want to do for our country \u2013 I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.\nI've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses \u2013 I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.\nWe spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be \u2013 all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.\nWe are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers \u2013 and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.\nIt's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.\nIt used to be the cars were made in Flint, and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint. We'll turn it all around.\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.\nYou have 44 days until the big vote. You have 44 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this nation.\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back \u2013 Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration \u2013 and yes we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; save the 2nd amendment, and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAnd we will put our great miners and steelworkers back to work.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nHillary Clinton has a 3-word campaign pledge. It reads: \"I'm With Her.\"\nI have a different pledge: I'm With You \u2013 the American People.\nTo all of our people, in all of our cities and towns, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","93":"\nThank you. It's wonderful to be here in Pennsylvania.\nGreat polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.\nOn November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nWe are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\nAt the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American: safety.\nWe are going to Make America Safe Again.\nThe rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens. It must be ended.\nThe main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace.\nWho is looking out for them?\nFor every one violent disruptor, there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school.\nTo all our citizens, in all of our inner cities, and all across the country, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you and I will fight for you.\nThe job of a leader is to stand in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective. Hillary Clinton calls people who don't support her deplorable, and irredeemable. I call anyone who doesn't support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law.\nI will be a President for all Americans, and I will campaign for every last vote, in every last community.\nI will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens.\nBut to do this, we must work with our police \u2013 not against our police.\nThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society \u2013 a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent \u2013 share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least.\nLow-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives.\n65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday.\nThe problem is not that there are too many police. The problem is that there are not enough police.\nPolice are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.\nBut our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from chaos.\nHillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night. No, it's the poor family living in the inner city \u2013 it's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country.\nWho is there to represent these families?\nHillary Clinton doesn't want to hear their voices. So I will be their voice, and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country. People who just want a secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and a good-paying job to support their loved ones.\nWe will bring security to our African-American communities, and to our Latino communities. We will also bring school choice, and new prosperity.\nDemocrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century. It's time for change \u2013 it's time for a New American Future.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nMy opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been \"fighting for women.\" That she has been \"fighting for children.\" Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, \"Watch what I do, not what I say.\"\nAt the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.\nAnd just last week here in Pennsylvania, I was joined by my daughter, Ivanka, and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.\nWe have also talked about improving education, and I will talk about it more tonight. A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege. The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish. Education is the bedrock of our society.\nWomen also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders. As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.\nBut even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.\nThis must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.\nThe changes will start immediately.\nOn my first day in office, I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses.\nThis will unleash a technology revolution. America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future. The next great American invention, the next great improvement to our lives, is right around the corner. All we have to do is remove the red tape.\nOur plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history. It's going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country a magnet for new jobs.\nWe are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution. Oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables. This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year.\nBut to be a prosperous nation, we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country.\nThat is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors. We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses.\nSteel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way.\nYour state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton.\nThe Clintons robbed Pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them to other countries \u2013 we are going to bring them back.\nJobs will come flowing back in all over America.\nIt used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nWe're going to turn it all around.\nThere's a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign \u2013 and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.\n95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you \u2013 visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement.\nLet me tell you what else we're going to do.\nOne of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education. The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973.\nBut what a lot of people don't know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments. These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt.\nInstead, these universities use the money to pay their administrators, or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money away. In fact, many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs.\nBut they should be using the money on the students \u2013 for tuition, for student life, and for student housing.\nOn top of that, the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year, plus another $130 billion on federal loans.\nHere again, the universities don't use the money to reduce the price of college \u2013 but to increase it.\nWe have to break this cycle. I'm going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars \u2013 paid for by you \u2013 that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt, and to spend their endowments on their own students.\nAnother major issue for all American families is healthcare. President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2,500 dollars. Instead, the opposite happened \u2013 the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5,000 dollars during that time.\nJust one more Washington lie \u2013 like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\nIt's a disaster.\nThat is why, on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\nWe are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first. These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts, empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines, and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens.\nHillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare.\nHer plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, by making them citizens \u2013 bankrupting these programs for Americans.\nShe doesn't understand how Democracy works. Public servants are just that \u2013 they're there to serve you. But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests.\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\nThey're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America \u2013 and America First.\nTogether, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.\nGovernment will start working again.

Thank you, Christine, for that kind introduction.\nI also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association for inviting me to join you here today. Your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans.\nLet me also recognize my friend, Harold Hamm.\nIt is great to be here in Pittsburgh, the Steel City. Under a Trump Administration, we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation.\nBefore going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country.\nOur country desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times \u2013 but which has lifted us up, in the past, to our greatest achievements as a nation. Every day, I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country \u2013 and become One American Nation, united by our shared values and principles as American Citizens.\nWe all have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes, see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our wounded country.\nMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding on their TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand.\nOur country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities.\nWe honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption, or to threaten the public safety and peace.\nEvery single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end.\nThe people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots, are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities. It is their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer \u2013 and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety.\nThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.\nOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace.\nFor every one violent protestor, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.\nMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.\nLast year, we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nMore than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone.\nNationwide, approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American.\nThis is a national crisis, and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives.\nLook at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York. The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable.\nWe need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again.\nI will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates \u2013 and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country.\nMy Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority.\nSafety is the foundation of the ladder to American success: a great education, and a good-paying job. To have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities.\nThat means we must recognize the contributions of our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent.\nWe all remember, earlier this year, when officers in Dallas \u2013 hunted down for execution \u2013 continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth.\nEvery day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return.\nPolice are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.\nBut our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from total chaos.\nThey are also the front lines of defense in the War on Terror, as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey, and New York, and the off-duty police officer's heroic actions in Minnesota.\nIn addition to providing safety, we must provide economic opportunity. That begins with school choice, and leads to a secure job with a rising income.\nThis brings us to the subject of energy.\nProducing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again \u2013 especially for the poorest Americans.\nAmerica is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy \u2013 some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.\nIt's all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices.\nI am going to lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities \u2013 including right here in Pennsylvania.\nAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following:\nincrease GDP by more than $100 billion annually\nadd over 500,000 new jobs annually\nincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years\nincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades\nincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\nIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama \u2013 creating countless more jobs in the process.\nOverall, my entire economic plan \u2013 tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform \u2013 will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent, and I believe we will reach 4% growth.\nMy tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from 35 percent today \u2013 turning America into a jobs magnet. Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent.\nIncome taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut \u2013 including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts.\nMy plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety. Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year.\nOn energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow.\nFinally, my plan includes a renegotiation of America's trade deals, and the enforcement of trade rules, to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States. Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term.\nIt is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.\nCompare that to my opponent. She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring of American jobs, and the aggressive restriction of American energy production. Her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system.\nHillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracturing in most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas.\nThis will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy.\nHer plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources.\nShe also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, \"Overall, more than a dozen [fossil fuel] projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo.\"\nExamples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility, among others.\nBillions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda.\nThe platform produced by Hillary Clinton's party this year also calls for a \"price on carbon.\" That's just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production \u2013 a tax on American consumers.\nAnd remember, every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country \u2013 often foreign countries not very friendly to us.\nThat not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries, but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards.\nThat is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America's vast energy reserves.\nWe need an America-First energy plan.\nThis means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.\nThe development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions \u2013 more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country.\nHillary Clinton's war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars.\nShe has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production \u2013 which supports 10 million jobs in the United States.\nAccess to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.\nWe have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy. The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families.\nAt the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel.\nBut federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically, and energy production in general.\nCurrently, less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development.\nAlmost 90% of our nation's offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production.\nOur energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources.\nThat means we will end the war on coal.\nI will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.\nWe will eliminate the highly-invasive \"Waters of the US\" rule, and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan \u2013 these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate.\nI will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans.\nI believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.\nIt will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success.\nIt will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions.\nIt will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on November 8th.\nWe Will make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n","95":"\n\"Hello, Orlando! Wow. Thank you all so much. I am so happy to be back and I want to thank all of you for being here today at the Frontline Outreach Youth and Family Center, which does so much good work in the community. I want to acknowledge your terrific mayor, Mayor Buddy Dyer, who was here earlier. I want to thank Pastor Wynn, Tiffany Namey, the chair of the Orange County Disability Caucus, and everyone \u2013 especially Val Demings. Where's Val? Val \u2013 I know \u2013 got this crowd really whipped up, and I want you to stay whipped up for Val. She is going to be a great member of Congress for everything that we care about and are fighting for.\nI want to thank Anastasia for that introduction. Didn't she do an amazing job? I first met Anastasia when she was nine years old. She raised her hand at a town hall and she said, 'My twin sister can't speak. Because of that, they put her in a separate class, apart from the rest of the kids. But she can communicate with a computer. And she's very smart and would do just as well as anyone else, if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance.' I was just blown away by this nine-year-old girl \u2013 her confidence and how much she loved her sister.\nSo Anastasia and I have stayed in touch over the years. When she grew up, she became an intern in the Senate. I was so proud of her speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia too. And I'm very excited that she's here with us today.\nI also want to thank Orlando. It's great to be back in this wonderful city with all of you. You've been through a lot this year. And what has been so notable is you've responded with grace. You've shown the world what Orlando is made of \u2013 strength, love and kindness. This is something we could all use more of right now.\nI'm here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone, but first, I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days. First, an unarmed man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa. Then, a man named Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte. I'm sending condolences and prayers to their families; I know a lot of you are as well.\nThere is still much we don't know about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters. It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.\nWe also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week. And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scott's death. Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage, honor and skill. We saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota. Our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right. And they likely saved a lot of lives. I've spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed, as I am, to reform. Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers. We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities.\nI've also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as their country's concerned, their lives seem disposable. We've got to do better. And I know we can. And if I'm elected president, we will \u2013 and we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done.\nLook, I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. But this is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.\nSybrina Fulton has become a friend of mine. Her son, Trayvon Martin, was killed not far from where we are today. Sybrina says, 'This is about saving our children.' And she's absolutely right. We need to come together, work together \u2013 white, black, Latino, Asian, all of us \u2013 to turn the tide, stop the violence, build the trust. We need to give all of our kids, no matter who they are, the chance to grow up safe and healthy in their communities and in our country.\nNow, there are so many issues we need to take on together, and that's why we're here today. Because in just 48 days \u2013 can you believe it, 48 days \u2013 Americans will go to the polls and choose our next president. Well, I hope so. I hope so. I want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that, in America, every person, no matter what you look like, who you are, who you love, you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you. And that is the basic bargain that made our country great, and it's our job to make sure it's there for you and future generations.\nBuilding an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, is the central challenge of our time. And I take it personally, because I'm a proud product of the American middle class. My grandfather started working in a lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, when he was just a boy, and worked there for 50 years. Thanks to him, my dad was able to go to college and then start his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. And because of my dad and my mom, I could head out into the world and follow my dreams.\nEvery American family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children. And history has shown us \u2013 our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive, broad-based growth \u2013 when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards.\nNow, here is just one example. The flood of women into the American workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But as women's labor participation has slowed in recent years, due in part to our failure to provide family-friendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare, so our economic growth wasn't as strong as it could have been. Women who want to work deserve to work. And whenever they are denied that opportunity, it's not fair to them \u2013 and we all lose out. In a competitive 21st century global economy, we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our own futures.\nThat's one reason why I care so much about supporting working parents. It's one reason why I'm such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation, and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base. It is estimated if we did this, despite what you hear from the other side, we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion in 10 years. Now, we need that.\nIt's also one reason why we've got to break down barriers of systemic racism, including under-investment that has held communities of color back for generations. That's part of building an inclusive economy, too. And it's why I believe we need to do more to help young people, who are left behind in the wake of the Great Recession, find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again. And we've got to help older Americans who've displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy.\nAnd too often, training and retraining doesn't work as it should. If you don't have a four-year degree, if you haven't really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years, it's hard to just make a course correction. We need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs, starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers. Whether you're trying to start your career or you've spent decades contributing to our economy, you deserve better.\nNow, these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy, and I'm going to hold up the book Tim Kaine and I have put out because we've actually put in one place all of our plans. You see, we have this old-fashioned idea if we're asking you to support us, we should tell you what we're going to do. Right? And today I want to focus on one area that hasn't gotten enough attention. It concerns a group of Americans who are too often invisible, overlooked, and undervalued, who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it. Now, that's been true for a long time, and we have to change it.\nI'm talking about people with disabilities, men and women, boys and girls, who have talents, skills, ideas, and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else. Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country. And right now, in too many ways, we are falling short. We've got to face that and do better for everyone's sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans. I intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency.\nI want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people. And I want you to hear this because this is not well-known. Nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability. Now, some of those disabilities are highly visible, some much harder to notice. If you don't know you know someone with a disability, I promise you, you do. But their disability is just one part of who they are.\nAcross the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They're holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us. They're veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe. They're working in the White House. Just last year a young woman named Leah Katz-Hernandez became the first West Wing receptionist who is deaf. So when world leaders come to the White House, the person who greets them is Leah. Think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone.\nAnd Americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns. I know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities, and they're doing phenomenal work. I'm grateful to them every single day. And people all over America would say the same about their boss, their colleague, their employee, their family member with a disability.\nNow, over the past few days, our country has taken leaps forward, not just in recogniz-ing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities, but in making long-overdue changes in our schools, workplaces, and communities so everyone can be part of our shared American life. Even so, not that long ago if you had a disability \u2013 if you couldn't see, couldn't walk, lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue \u2013 that one fact was allowed to define your entire life. Because of that and that alone, the world was closed to you. Not all of it and not for everyone, but for most people, basic essential things that others could do you couldn't and never would. And that was that.\nI saw this for myself, as Anastasia said, years ago when I was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the Children's Defense Fund. One of my first assignments was to figure out why so many American kids weren't in school. We looked at census tract numbers and we said, okay. How many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract? Then we would look at school enrollment numbers, and there'd be a gap. And we would say, wait a minute. Where are the kids? Why aren't they in school?\nI went door to door, along with people across our country, going into different communities. I was in New Bedford, Massachusetts. We saw a notable disparity there, and I soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities. There were kids who were hard of hearing, kids with intellectual disabilities. I remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart, curious, desperate to go to school. But that chair held her back. Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms. Most teachers and aides weren't trained to help her. So she didn't get to go. It felt like the world had said to her, sorry, kid. Your life just isn't going to be worth very much. And she and her family weren't rich. They weren't powerful. So what could they do about it?\nThat little girl reminded me of another little girl, my mother. She didn't face the same challenges, but she, too, was clocked from a full and happy childhood \u2013 abandoned by her own parents, raised by grandparents who didn't want her, and ended up on her own when she was just 14, supporting herself as a housemaid. But then something finally went her way. The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school. And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like. After many lonely years, it was the start of a better life.\nThe core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And I remembered that, sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair. My colleagues and I at the Children's Defense Fund, along with others, gathered the facts, and we built a coalition of activists and families across America, and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids.\nSo we opened the doors to school, and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed, 26 years ago. It was bipartisan. The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported. And, by the way, I'm proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this.\nAs Secretary of State, I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world. And over the years, I've spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities. In addition to Anastasia, who spoke at the convention, another young man, Ryan Moore, also spoke there. I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old. I was fighting for health care reform. He was born with a rare form of dwarfism. But he never let that stop him. He's had so many surgeries, we've lost count of them. But his family was always there for them and \u2013 for him. And he was the advocate for himself as he got older. Now he's a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district. And he's just one of the most optimistic people you'll ever meet.\nListening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance, never got the chance to get the education, let alone go to college, become forces for change. And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America.\nI'll never forget something that the actor Christopher Reeve said. Some of you may be too young to know who he was. He was a huge star. He played Superman. He was unbelievably good-looking. He and his wonderful wife were friends of mine. And then he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident. He once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics, 'family values.' 'Since my accident,' he said, 'I've found a definition that seems to make sense. I think it means that we're all family and we all have value.' I couldn't agree more.\nWe've come a long way since the fall of 1973, when I was going door to door talking to kids and families. But make no mistake. We still have a lot more work to do. We can't be satisfied, not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities aren't in the workforce, not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage [cheers and applause], not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day. We've got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, treats them with respect.\nNow, one advocate after another has told me the same thing, 'We don't want pity. We want paychecks. We want the chance to contribute.' As president, I'm going to give \u2013 give them that chance. First, we're going to focus on jobs and incomes. I'm going to fight to give more Americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits. People with disabilities shouldn't be isolated. They should be given the chance to work with everyone else. And we're going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past. Good work deserves fair pay, no matter who you are.\nSecond, we're going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities. To have a truly inclusive economy, we need a truly inclusive education system. So let's raise our standards. For too long, accessibility has been an afterthought. Let's make it a priority in our curriculums, our classrooms, and the technology our students use. It's like what Anastasia said about her sister. She can communicate through a computer. Then let's make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so.\nThird, we're going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired. As part of that, we'll launch a new effort we're calling Autism Works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace.\nFourth, let's build on the success of the Americans with Disabilities Act by finally ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum, and it's a chance to show American values and American leadership. And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady, I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country. When I was secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities. Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away, basically forgotten. I want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities.\nNow, these ideas are just a start. We're working with advocates to come up with even more. If you've got an idea, we want to hear it. Go to hillaryclinton.com and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate. This issue is very close to my heart.\nI've always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military. It's how we treat our fellow human beings, especially the most vulnerable among us. And on this front especially, I intend for my presidency to move our country forward. Together, we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream.\nNow, if you want some proof, let me tell you this story. It's a story of a woman named Freia David. Now, some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe. I've carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much. Freia has Down syndrome. When she was 21, she got her first job, at the local McDonald's. Her mother was a little worried, as any mother would be. She wondered, would Freia be able to handle being independent? Could she handle the job? Would she even pass the six-month training program? Well, not everyone in her class passed, but Freia did. And then \u2013 then she excelled at that job for 32 years. Her colleagues loved her, and she loved them. The restaurant became such a home to her that she'd bring her family there on off days just to hang out.\nEarlier this year, Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia. She knew that meant she had to stop working, but 32 years is a pretty good run, isn't it? It broke her heart. One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor. Her family hoped a few people might show up. And in the end, nearly 100 people did: customers, colleagues and friends from over the years. The party lasted three hours. And at one point, one of Freia's former managers asked for everyone's attention. She turned to Freia, and she said, 'We love you. We appreciate you. We respect you. And we are all better people for having you in our lives.'\nMy friends, after years of hard work and treating people right, isn't that what we all want to hear? Isn't that America at our best? We don't thrive on tearing each other apart, or separating ourselves. We know we are stronger together. We believe in equality and dignity for all. And when we fall short, we strive to do better, not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves, to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for. This election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal, to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering America, to say loudly and clearly in this country, no one's worthless, no one's 'less than.' We're all of value. In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe everyone is created equal. And you know what else we believe? We all believe love trumps hate.\nThank you all.\"\n","96":"\nThank you. It's wonderful to be back in North Carolina.\nCome November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nWe are going to bring back your jobs.\nWe are going to cut your taxes.\nWe are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals.\nAnd we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nOver the weekend, there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City, and in New Jersey. These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country.\nAttack after attack \u2013 from 9\/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando \u2013 we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger.\nSo let me state this very clearly: immigration security is national security.\nMy opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency. As Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\nNow Obama wants to bring in an additional 110,000 refugees, and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term \u2013 with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.\nThis isn't just a matter of terrorism, but also quality of life. We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country.\nMy highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day \u2013 and I will never waver in that sacred obligation.\nIt's just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering. Since 9\/11, hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States.\nNow we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders. This is unacceptable.\nAltogether, there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed.\nIn the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism.\nNow we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nYet, my opponent won't even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism. In fact, Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists. She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign \u2013 many of them cops and soldiers \u2013 deplorable and irredeemable. Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam, or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas? Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? In many countries overseas, non-believers face the death penalty \u2013 where is Hillary's condemnation here?\nLet's ask Hillary Clinton: how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views, and support the oppression of non-believers, would you call deplorable or irredeemable \u2013 or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump?\nAmerica can never elect a President, like Hillary Clinton, who apparently, with her choice of words, thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists.\nAnyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President.\nThe commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction. Our system of government is the best in the world and, as your President, I will defend our values \u2013 and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way.\nIt's also time to remember one very important word: accountability. All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clinton's watch.\nHer policies in Iraq, Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS. Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us.\nHer timetable withdrawal from Iraq, her push for regime change in Libya and Syria, her open borders policies \u2013 these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster.\nSo she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure.\nHer claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool, demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying.\nWhen she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides \"aid and comfort,\" to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office. Her comments are not only reckless, but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks.\nISIS is torturing, murdering, executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide. And what is Hillary Clinton's suggestion? That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers. I have news for Hillary Clinton: refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger, it will only increase and embolden the danger \u2013 just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State.\nThe rise of ISIS is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.\nSecretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes, displace millions, and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country. How is this a smart policy?\nHillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today \u2013 and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores.\nWe must stop the massive inflow of refugees \u2013 which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase. We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur.\nPew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion \u2013 such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith\u2013 are commonplace.\nIt is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here, and to become part of our incredible home. Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule, and it's one more reason why she can never be President.\nIt's time to break with the corruption, the bad judgement, and the failures of the past.\nIt is time to have a new American Future.\nWe are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values.\nWe are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas, and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism. This will not only require military warfare, but also financial warfare, cyber warfare, and ideological warfare.\nBut to win this struggle, we need to be strong at home.\nWe are going to rebuild our country.\nAnd at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities.\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.\nViolent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year.\nThe schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty.\nTo the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it \u2013 I will bring back your jobs, I will fix your schools, and I will fight for you as no one ever has before.\nIt is time for a new civil rights agenda, one that promises safe communities, great education, and good-paying jobs.\nMy whole life has been about creating jobs. Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs \u2013 just look at upstate New York, and her terrible trade deals.\nHillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through.\nThe South Korean deal was supposed to create 70,000 jobs \u2013 instead, we lost 100,000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled.\nNext, Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nYour state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal \u2013 and if we don't get the deal we want, I will walk away.\nOur trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year \u2013 this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton.\nBut we are going to turn it all around.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.\nI am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to create American energy independence; I'm going to make our government lean, responsible and efficient; I'm going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States;\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","97":"\n\"Thank you. Thank you, Temple! I am so delighted to be here with all of you. I saw how much fun President Obama had last week and \u2013 I wanted to be here in Philadelphia.\nBefore I begin with my remarks, I do want to say how proud I am of our brave first responders working to keep us safe after the attacks of the last weekend in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. There are now reports of a suspect in custody, but we must remain vigilant. This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world.\nI'm here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really, much more than that, they are part of our future \u2013 the kind of country we want to have, the kind of people we want to be and, particularly, what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of America. I have a proud Owl on my staff, Jamira Burley. A Philadelphia native who became an activist working to end the epidemic of gun violence right here in Philadelphia. She loves Temple and we love her. And I also want to thank Lauren for that introduction.\nJamira and Lauren are two examples of why I do have so much faith in our future. Your generation is the most inclusive, progressive and entrepreneurial that we've ever seen. And as you heard, when Lauren was in college, she saw challenges facing students of color, but there was no NAACP chapter to support them and promote diversity and inclusion on campus \u2013 so she started one. And Lauren remains committed and engaged, working with an organization called Generation Progress, because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades.\nNow, I know that with so much negativity out there, it is really easy to get cynical \u2013 especially about our politics. I remember wrestling with that challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War. It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing's ever going to change. But you're here today because you refuse to accept cynicism. You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years. And you see how much needs fixing in our country, from the soaring cost of college to the scourge of systemic racism to the threat from climate change \u2013 but you also know the only way we can meet those challenges is if we meet them together.\nYou're here today because you believe we can do just that. You want something to vote for, not just against. Optimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls. You're also here because you know this election isn't a reality TV show. It shouldn't be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get onto cable news.\nThis election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America. I believe it's wrong to tear each down. We should be lifting each other up. It's wrong to let income inequality get even worse. We have to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. And it's wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war. We should work with our allies to keep us safe.\nIt comes down to this: Are we going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country, or are we going to be, as I know we can, stronger together?\nI know what I believe, and I'm going to close my campaign the same way I started my career \u2013 fighting for kids and young people and families. That has been the cause of my life. And it will be the passion of my presidency, and I hope you'll join me. We can't get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus. My husband has a saying about that. He calls it majoring in the minors \u2013 getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesn't matter, you forget what's really important to your future and to the future of this country.\nTake the challenges facing young Americans today. First of all, if you're willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world. But that's been out of reach for too many young people \u2013 trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. That's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs. We can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020; installing half a billion solar panels; building a cleaner, more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country.\nNext, getting an education should give you a boost, not hold you back. But as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up. I understand that Temple was founded to democratize, diversify and widen the reach of higher education. That is still a vital goal.\nSo I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan. We came up with a plan that makes public college tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone. And if you already have debt, we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford. You can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the College Calculator at hillaryclinton.com.\nAnd here's something we don't talk about enough: a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America. People should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and making a good living because of that. So we're offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board \u2013 for welders, machinists, health technicians, coders, and so many other fields.\nAnother challenge I hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in today's economy. Families look different today than they did decades ago, I think we can all agree. Most need two incomes just to get by. And many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules, or they have to cobble together part-time work, all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country.\nThat's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to help working families with quality, affordable childcare, preschool and paid family leave. We fundamentally believe \u2013 the more we can strengthen families, the stronger we will be as a nation.\nEverywhere I go, young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in America today. You aren't \u2013 and you shouldn't be \u2013 satisfied with the progress we've made. You should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all. We see, as Lauren said, too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans bullied; too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home. And more than previous generations, you understand that all these challenges are intersecting, and we must take them on together.\nBut you also see a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like we've never seen before in any campaign. Hate speech being normalized. The dog whistles are out in the open. And yet, despite this, I remain convinced America's best days are ahead of us. In large part, that's because of the inspiring young people I meet every day.\nI'm inspired by Astrid. I met her in Las Vegas last summer. She was brought to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she's in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented Americans and comprehensive immigration reform. We should all join her in this.\nI'm inspired by Mikey, who I met in New York. Mikey spent six months in prison for a low-level drug offense. After he got out, Mikey discovered just how hard it is for people who've done their time to find good jobs and opportunities. But he persisted, and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in New York \u2013 and I can recommend, it's delicious. We have to do more to help others get that second chance, including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system.\nI'm inspired by Erica, one of the bravest young women I've ever met. Her mother, Dawn, was the principal of Sandy Hook School who died trying to protect her students. Erica was devastated. But then, she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms. It's been painful for her \u2013 a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful \u2013 but Erica won't give up. As she said, 'What if everyone who faced tough odds said, it's hard, so I'm going to walk away? That's not the type of world I want to live in.'\nThat's the spirit that makes this country great \u2013 we might get knocked down, but we get right back up again. And we refuse to quit, no matter what. And that's the spirit we need in this election too.\nNow, I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship, the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm. I also know that even if you're totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that. And I want to do my best to answer those questions.\nWhen it comes to public service, the 'service' part has always easier for me than the 'public' part. I will never be the showman my opponent is \u2013 and you know what, that's okay with me. And it's also true I do spend a lot of time on the details of policy, like the precise interest rate on your student loans, right down to the decimal. But that's because it's not a detail for you. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.\nSo here's what I ask any voter who is still undecided: Give us both a fair hearing. Hold us accountable for our ideas, both of us. I can't promise you'll agree with me all the time, but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better. I will never stop, no matter how tough it gets. In fact, you can read about what Tim and I want to do. We're not keeping it a secret. We've got a book called 'Stronger Together.'\nBut let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president. I want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice, activism, and public service.\nThe first woman is my mother. Her name was Dorothy, and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up out on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. When I learned about this many years later, I asked how she managed to grow up into a warm, loving person and not become bitter and broken. And here's what she said, one word: 'kindness.' She was saved by the kindness of others. Like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share. The lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. She made sure I learned the words of one of the creeds of our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.\nThat mission guides me still today. When I stumble, it helps pick me up, because there's always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open, especially kids.\nWhen I met a terrified little girl in Nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported, it hit me right in the gut. I knew how hard-working her parents were. I knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life. When I met a little boy in Flint, Michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead, it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder. Every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of America.\nThe second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman. She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi, first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar. She was an ally of Dr. King and Robert Kennedy, and the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, an altogether remarkable person. One day during my first semester in law school, I saw a flyer \u2013 we used to have those, flyers on a campus bulletin board. And Marian was coming to give a lecture. I made sure to be there, and what I heard was captivating. Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families. Something just clicked in my brain. I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others I'd learned from my mother, my church, into real social change. I went up to her and I said, 'Could I work for you this summer?' She said, 'Sure, but I can't pay you.' I said, 'Well, I am paying my way through law school, so I have to get paid.' She said, 'Well, if you can figure out how to get paid, you can have a job.' So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her.\nAfter graduation, I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm, but I went to work for Marian at the Children's Defense Fund instead. She sent me door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then. And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted an education, but it just didn't seem possible. My heart went out to her and I wanted to help. But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. That wouldn't force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education. I learned that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. So we gathered evidence. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families.\nI went to South Carolina to investigate the plight of 12- and 13-year-old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies. In Alabama I helped expose the racism of segregated academies. In Arkansas I ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it. When Bill was elected President, a lot of people were surprised, and even threatened, by the idea of an activist as First Lady. But I wasn't about to quit then, either. I fought for universal health care, and ended up working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids today.\nThe third woman who changed my life was named Sophia, the 17-year-old captain of a high school basketball team in New York City. It was the late 1990s, and Democrats in New York were urging me to run for the Senate, and I kept telling them no. After all, no First Lady had ever done anything like that. I myself hadn't run for anything since student council. I'd always been an advocate, not a politician. But then one day I visited that school in New York for an event with young women athletes with Billie Jean King. Hanging above our heads was a big banner that said, 'Dare to compete.' Before my speech, Sophia introduced me. She was tall, and as we shook hands, she bent over and whispered in my ear, 'Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton. Dare to compete.' Once again, something just clicked. For years I had been telling young women to step up. Participate. Go for what you believe in. Could it be I was afraid to do something I had urge so many others to do?\nWell, it was a difficult transition, becoming a candidate for the first time back in that New York Senate race. Even all these years later, I confess I don't enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians, like talking about myself. But I took that leap then for the same reason I'm running now, to even the odds for those who've got the odds stacked against them, especially children and families. And I've learned that in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out. We need activists and advocates, entrepreneurs and innovators, teachers and mentors, people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways. We also need strong, principled leaders who can win votes, write laws, allocate resources, and do the slow, hard business of governing.\nNow, of course, politics can be discouraging. This election in particularly can be down-right depressing sometimes. But it matters. It really does. It matters for our families, our communities, and our country and the world. Our most cherished values are at stake. Every election is important, from school board to state senate to president. But this time is different. We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black President, and he's still lying about it today. He refuses to apologize to President Obama, his family, and the American people. We have to stand up to this hate. We cannot let it go on.\nAnd when we do that, we send a clear message: America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump. Just as important, we have a chance to make real progress together in our country. I need you. I need you as partners, not just for winning this election, but for driving real change over the next four years. The fights ahead of us are bigger than one election, one president, or even one generation. It's going to take all of us working side-by-side to build the kind of future we want. That's why, if I'm in the White House, young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made.\nSo if you believe diversity is America's strength, not America's burden, join us. If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full-time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us. If you believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable, quality health care, join us. If you believe we should finally guarantee equal pay for women, join us.\nAnd here's how you can join us. Go to iwillvote.com and register today. Register your friends. Register everyone you know. This is going to be close. We need everyone off the sidelines. Not voting is not an option. That just plays into Trump's hands. It really does. Text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. I understand here at Temple you're already organizing campaign tailgates at every football game and having a lot of fun doing it. We have 50 days, 50 days, to reach everybody we possibly can, to not only win an election \u2013 that's just the first step \u2013 then to keep the progress going, go even further, make it absolutely clear that we're going to shape a future that represents the best of who we are. So talk to your classmates. Talk to your neighbors. Help us stand up for our best values and reject prejudice and paranoia.\nYou know, I mentioned my mother and the kindness she experienced. Her life was so neglected that when she went to work as that housekeeper\/babysitter at the age of 14, it was the first time she ever saw a family that loved each other, where the parents loved their children, cared for them, planned for them, where she learned the lessons that enabled her to be such an extraordinary mother to me and my brothers. Everything I've learned in my life convinces me that love trumps hate.\nSo please join us in working together. There's no doubt in my mind that young people have more at stake in this election than any other age group. And when you turn out and vote this fall, we will be sending a message much larger than even the outcome. We will say we can build a future where all our children have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, no matter who they are, where they're from, what they look like, or who they love. That's the America we believe in. That's the America worth fighting for. That's what we've got to do to stand together. We are stronger together, and let's make sure love trumps hate. Thank you all!\"\n","98":"\n\"Hello. It's so great to be back here with all of you tonight. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Jim Clyburn; Don Peebles; Representative Butterfield; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; and congratulate all of the honorees. On a personal note, I want to recognize a dear friend who is retiring after 46 years, Congressman Charles Rangel. He is one of a kind, and we are grateful for your years of service.\nAnd what can I say about one of the best Presidents this country has ever had, Barack Obama? All through this campaign, I have made the point over and over again, Presi-dent Obama saved our country from a second Great Depression. He brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And so much more. I, for one, don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what he's done on behalf of our country and the world. And it's not just the President he's been, but the man he is. Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters, have represented our country with class, grace, and integrity. As Michelle says, 'When others go low, we go high.' I know I speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of Americans: Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you're a great American! And you make us all proud to be Americans, too.\nLet me thank the leadership of the CBC Foundation for this great honor, and to thank all of my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for it as well. I dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that I could follow in their footsteps \u2013 Barbara Jordan. Shirley Chisholm. I would not be standing here without them. Generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us.\nThis award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding Americans back, to leaders like all of you, and to a rising generation of young activists. To all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in America, every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential. This has been the cause of my life ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way that I will serve as your president, focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families.\nWe have so much work to do together. I've heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign. One was from Tianna Gaines-Turner, a working mother to three children from Northeast Philadelphia. She testified at the DNC platform meeting in June and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a part-time job. She said she'd been hungry more times than she could count, and that life felt like a maze, because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned. But despite all of this, Tianna has hope. She still believes that her 8-year-old daughter will be president one day. And she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family. Let's prove her right.\nAs a country, we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams. That is what's at stake in this election. It's not about golf course promotions or birth certificate. It comes down to\nwho will fight for the forgotten, who will invest in our children, and who will really have your back in the White House.\nWe need ideas, not insults, real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind, not prejudice and paranoia. We can't let Barack Obama's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn't understand that, whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards. Instead, we need to come together, to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage, to invest in neglected communities with efforts like Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 plan, to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people, to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice, and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in.\nWhen you really think about it, the choice this November is about so much more than Democrats and Republicans. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic convention, it's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be, what we want to leave behind for future generations. I thank everyone here, who has been fighting for this vision over so many years. I thank all who have supported me. I want you to know I'm not taking your vote or anyone's vote for granted. I'm working every single day to earn your support. And I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together.\nBarbara Jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation. So to everyone here tonight, please, keep doing what you're doing, but also help to register voters. Tell others about the clear choice in this election. In some states, early voting is nearly here, so we need to keep the pressure on. Let's send a loud and clear message once and for all: We are stronger together. And no matter what, remember this: Love trumps hate. Thank you all very much!\"\n","99":"\nThanks, Maria, for that introduction, and for the work you and your organization do to honor these stolen American lives \u2013 and to advocate for justice on behalf of all American victims.\nI am honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced into the shadows. Your stories are not featured in the news, you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf, you have no special interests taking up your cause, and politicians ignore your cries for help. But I never will.\nI have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign. But nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I've spent with the families of the Remembrance Project, and the incredible strength and courage you've shown in your often lonely fight for justice.\nYou are heroes. And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters or parents.\nThe most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives. Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office.\nEvery day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized. Every day Sanctuary Cities are left in place, innocent Americans are put in harm's way. Every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child.\nIt's happening every single day.\nAll across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table, because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the laws.\nThere are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate. But let me give you the most important number of all. That most important number of all is the number of American lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration. Let me tell you what that number is: ZERO.\nOur nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws. What do you tell to the mother, who just buried her daughter, because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home?\nWhat do you tell to the young boy, who will grow up without a dad, because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the country?\nWhat do you tell the wife, who has lost her husband, because a Sanctuary City released an illegal immigrant from behind bars?\nThis must end. And it must end right now. Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders.\nJust look at what's happened in the last few days.\nLast week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a three-year period.\nEarlier this week, in Kansas, a Sheriff's Department Master Deputy was killed, apparently by an illegal immigrant. The driver was previously arrested for a DUI in California in 2001 and for a traffic violation in Kansas in 2013. Deputy Collins was killed only hours after his daughter's fourth birthday.\nA few days ago, two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa. This individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported \u2013 but his home country refused to take him back, so he was simply released. One of the victims has six children, is an Air Force Veteran, and a high school football coach \u2013 the other victim is a mother and a grandmother.\nWhen Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton's desk. But she failed to take forceful action, and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don't take back their citizens.\nAccording to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Most of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch \u2013 she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.\nNow, my opponent will never meet with you. She will never hear your stories. She will never share in your pain.\nShe will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates.\nHer plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days, which means Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants. Her plan calls for catch-and-release on the border. Sanctuary Cities. Ignoring visa overstays. Closing detention centers. And a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America.\nHillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order \u2013 violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril.\nHillary Clinton is the first person to ever run for the Presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that country.\nBut the media doesn't want you to know any of that. So they'll never ask her any questions about her plan. Like how she'll afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants, or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody \u2013 or at the border. She's not asked to explain what she'll say to the American workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law.\nYour cause, and your stories, are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost. To them, your presence is just too inconvenient.\nBut help is coming. On November 8th, we are going to win the White House and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every American victim.\nTogether, we will save American lives \u2013 and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room today.\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities \u2013 these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation.\nAccording to the federal government's own data, there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the United States right now. However, this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice, fled the jurisdiction, or were otherwise never caught. Many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases.\nAt the same time, hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism. We are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believe.\nWhether it's drugs, terrorism or violent crime, our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country. The Border Patrol Agents, who endorsed me, warned that Hillary Clinton's plan would put the entire country in grave danger \u2013 they called it radical, deeply dangerous, and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis.\nLet's just remember our goal \u2013 to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate.\nThat is what is at stake in this election.\nSo I am now going to invite some of the bravest people I know to come up to the stage and speak.\n[INVITE FAMILIES TO SPEAK]\nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer.\nI am here standing with you. The American people are here standing with you. And come November, your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive.\n","100":"\n\"Hello, B-W-A. I thank you all for that warm welcome. There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here with all of you this morning.\nPlease everyone be seated. This is such a great opportunity to lift up the work that so many of you have done for years -- your organizations, individually -- and I am grateful for it because it has helped to guide me in a lot of the work that I've been privileged to do.\nI want to thank Gwen Hess for her introduction. I want to acknowledge, it's always great to see a woman serve as president in any setting.\nI want to congratulate today's honorees. Everyone is so deserving of this recognition. I also want to acknowledge a few others. We have some fierce members of Congress with us today, women whom I admire, who have been my colleagues and friends and with whom I am looking forward to continuing our work: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Gwen Moore, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett.\nAnd I want to give a special shout out to Congresswoman Joyce Beatty. When I saw Joyce recently, she said, 'Well, you are coming, aren't you?' And I said, 'I'm working hard to get it set.' And I am so proud that it did work out, and I thank Joyce for that extra push.\nI also want to acknowledge someone who had such a profound effect on my life, in every way, someone whom I admire and love, Marian Wright Edelman. This audience is filled with longtime friends and people I went to Wellesley College with that became life-long friends to me, and so many of you who have been on the front lines -- everyone associated with The Black Women's Agenda, I'm thrilled to be with you. I'm thrilled to be associated with you. I'm also thrilled to be back on the campaign trail. As the world knows, I was a little under the weather recently. The good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women's health.\nLooking back, I know, I should have followed my doctor's orders to rest, but, my instinct was to push through it. That is what women do every single day, and I felt no different. Life has shown us that we do have to work harder at the office while still bearing most of the responsibilities at home -- that we always need to keep going because our families and our communities count on us. And I think it is more than fair to say, that black women have an even tougher road.\nAnd you, your daughters, your granddaughters -- I was pleased to meet Gwen's beautiful granddaughter earlier -- leave the house every morning, put on that game face that we all practice, and enter a society that consistently challenges your worth. With the images you see, the lower pay that so many take home, that try to silence your voices and break your spirits; yet, you remain fierce in the face of these challenges. We see that every day in the businesses you start, the art you create, the children you teach and the communities and organizations you lead. While your stories are often missing from the history books -- make no mistake -- you are the change makers, the path breakers, and the ground shakers. And, you are proof that yes, indeed, black girl magic is real.\nNow, I've been blessed to see this magic's influence on kids and communities up close for decades, starting with my first job after law school working with Marian at the Children's Defense Fund. Marian's belief was that every single child had worth and potential and deserved the opportunity to live up to their god potential with the tools and the support that every child needs. And that if we just improve the odds a bit for those suffering in poverty, they could flourish. So she led our team into some very poor communities. We met kids who had dropped out of school because they couldn't afford textbooks or transportation. Some didn't have decent clothes and stayed home to avoid being humiliated in class. Some had untreated medical and dental problems that made it practically impossible for them to learn. Those stories really hurt my heart.\nBut Marian always believed we could deliver help and hope if we never ever gave up. So she taught us ways to think creatively, as well as strategically-- to take our advocacy and turn it into action and results. She sent me to New Bedford, Massachusetts, to go door to door looking for children who weren't in school. That was back before we had a legal requirement that every child, regardless of disability, deserved to get an education. I met a young girl in New Bedford and sat and talked with her on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to learn, but couldn't because schools weren't accessible or welcoming. So Marian had us get to work and change that.\nWe gathered evidence and built a coalition. We helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. Marian showed me that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. And there is no question, I'm here today because of her example. I also want to recognize pioneers like Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm, who sacrificed and struggled so that I and so many other women running for office could soar. I'm here because of friends and colleagues, like Donna Brazile, Reverend Leah Daugherty and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge \u2014 three black women who ran the Democratic National Convention in July. It was a great four days.\nIt goes to show that black women deserve more than a seat at the table. It's past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting. And let's be clear: I would not be the Demo-cratic nominee for President of the United States were it not for black women like all of you who made noise at the polls this year in support of our campaign -- who did surrogate events, went to barber shops and beauty salons and cafes, got on local radio and local TV to make the case. We've come far together.\nAnd as I said yesterday in North Carolina, I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career all those years ago at the Children's Defense Fund, and the way that I will serve as your president should I have the great honor of being elected: I will be focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families. The American people deserve something to vote for, not just against.\nAnd together -- together, we are going to make this a freer, fairer and stronger nation.\nWe're going to fight for the parents struggling to balance family and work and push for affordable child care, paid family leave, and yes, finally, equal pay for women.\nWe'll fight for the young girls who want a fair chance in life, which is why we'll make universal pre-k available so that every child -- no matter what they look like or where they live -- can rise up and be prepared to fulfill their academic destiny.\nWe are also going to do a lot to emphasize STEM education, particularly for girls and women, and I thank the agenda for making that a priority!\nWe'll fight for the entrepreneur who said that more businesses die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else, which is why we're going to increase access to capital, and we are going to help African American women continue to represent the fastest growing segment of women-owned businesses in America right now.\nWe are going to invest in communities that have been left out and left behind. Urban reinvestment and restructuring that is going to give more people decent housing, access to jobs, the transportation to get to those jobs, rural communities that are too often ignored and denied the services they need. I am a fan of Jim Clyburn's '10-20-30' plan. I am going to do everything I can to push that forward.\nWe'll remember the pain of the Mothers of the Movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and a future where everyone has respect for the law and is respected by the law. And we are going to pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and keep our communities safe.\nWe'll remember the families neglected in Flint and take action so that no child's life is ever put at risk again when brushing their teeth or drinking a glass of water at din-ner. We'll advocate for everyone concerned about their parents and grandparents as they age, and lift up caregivers and home care workers so older Americans can live in comfort and with dignity.\nAnd we're going to protect and enhance Social Security, which is the main source of income for older women. We'll stand-by-side to make sure that all of our rights are respected and protected \u2013 civil rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, worker's rights and, of course, voting rights.\nWe are coming together at a pivotal moment for our country. Now I do believe that every election is important. But this one feels different, doesn't it? That's because it is. The next 53 days will shape the next 50 years. The future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance.\nOn one hand, we have my opponent, Donald Trump, and in recent weeks, he's tried to restrain himself and clean up his image. But as Maya Angelou once said, 'When some-one shows you who they are, believe them the first time.' And we know who Donald is. For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president. His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history.\nJust yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States. Donald's advisors had the temerity to say, 'He's doing the country a 'service' by pushing these lies.' No, he isn't. He's feeding into the worst im-pulses -- the bigotry and bias -- that lurks in our country.\nBarack Obama was born in America, plain and simple. And Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology. So, my friends, there is no 'new' Donald Trump. There never will be. Donald Trump looks at President Obama after eight years as our president. He still doesn't see him as an American.\nThink of how dangerous that is. Imagine a person in the Oval Office who traffics in conspiracy theories and refuses to let them go \u2013 no matter what the facts are. Imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world. Imagine a president who sees someone who doesn't look like him, and doesn't agree with him, and thinks, 'That person must not be a real American.'\nDonald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States. We cannot become insensitive to what he says and what he stirs up. We can't just accept this.We've got to stand up to it. If we don't, it won't stop.\nIn addition to the president, Donald Trump looks at a distinguished federal judge, born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American. He looks at a Gold Star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans. He looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of one to 10. I look at America, I see everyone. I see our great diversity, which is one of our core strengths, not our burden. We know who Donald Trump is. Now it's time for our country to show who we are and reject his divisive vision.\nThat's why this election is so important. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic Convention, 'When we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between a Democrat or Republican.' It's about who will have the power to shape our children's lives for the next four years. It's also about the kind of country we want to be, and what we want to leave behind for future generations.\nWe are at our best when every person gets to share in our nation's promise, contribute to its progress. 'Stronger Together' is not just our campaign slogan. It's the guiding principle for the future we need to build. So Americans, we need to ask themselves: Are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just for those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything that generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?\nNow in many ways, the profound choice is up to the women in this room. African American women turned out to vote more than any other group of Americans in 2012. This year, once again, you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the American story.\nKeep up the great work with your Four for 4' campaign. Make sure we get as many people registered and then to the polls as we possibly can. People say to me all time, 'I just -- I don't know what to do about Trump and his supporters and the things he says and inciting violence and all of the terrible activities that are happening this election year.'\nWell, here's what we can do. Let's reject the cynicism, the bullying, the divisive rhetoric that my opponent uses to make us afraid of each other, afraid of our differences, afraid of our future. I know that all of us in this room are ready to stand up against this ... to rise up for our families, our communities, but most importantly, to show up at the polls this November.\nWith our power and strength, I know -- I believe this, or I would not be standing here before you, I would not have run again for president, I would not deal with all the in-coming brickbats that are hurled my way if I did not in my heart believe with every fiber of my being that together we can build a future where, yes, love trumps hate.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\"\n","101":"\nThank you. It is so great to be in my second home, Florida, and in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and employees.\nNew polls have just come in, and we're leading in battleground states all over this country \u2013 including four points here in Florida. LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide.\nCome November 8th, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House.\nIt's going to be a victory for the people \u2013 it's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the Veterans, the everyday citizens.\nAnd it's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason for hope in a long time.\nI'm campaigning in every community, and every part of this country, for every last vote. I am running to be a President for all Americans.\nI just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes. What incredible people.\nOur support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life. You are cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic \u2013 but above all else, you are American.\nJust today, I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders. We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals.\nWe also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol Officers \u2013 as well as law enforcement officers across the country.\nAnd we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run.\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country.\nClinton's campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists. It's the oldest play in the Democratic play book \u2013 and Americans have had enough.\nThey want solutions, and they want better lives \u2013 not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians.\nPeople who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.\nPeople who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.\nPeople who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.\nYet, while she lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors, she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.\nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.\nIt's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world. It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS.\nHer policies have created disaster overseas, and poverty at home. I am running to reverse these failures, and create a New American future.\nThat future begins with prosperity at home.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nOne of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities. African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.\nDemocrats have run these inner cities for half a century. They control the mayors' offices, the school boards, the city councils, and the seats in Congress \u2013 and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime, and more failing schools.\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty. More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone. 58% of African-American youth are not working.\nThese are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, and everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering.\nHillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years \u2013 her disastrous record speaks for itself.\nThe only people she delivers for is her donors.\nI am going to deliver for you, the American people.\nIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.\nMy first day in office, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on American energy \u2013 which means at least another half a million new jobs a year.\nThat's just the beginning.\nAlso on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare \u2013 this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.\nI am also going to completely reform our trade deals. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and keep America out of the TPP. We don't need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down.\nAnother major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.\nThis will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.\nSince President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty. This is unacceptable. To the Hispanic community I say: we are going to protect your jobs, we are going to build up your schools, and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.\nEarlier this week, I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.\nOn policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.\nWe are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression.\nThe President's one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime. But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order, which means the next President can reverse them \u2013 and that is what I will do, unless the Castro Regime meets our demands. Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.\nLet's also talk about Venezuela.\nVenezuela is a beautiful, vibrant, and resource-rich country, filled with amazing and hardworking people. But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists.\nThe next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free.\nHere, in America, I will push to expand freedom for all of our people.\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA \u2013 and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Prosperous Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","102":"\n\"Thank you. Thank you all. Hello, everyone. It's great to be here at UNC Greensboro. I want to thank Martha for that wonderful introduction. It means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter, Sara, and her mother, Barbara. And the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like Sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them. So to see Sara grown up and thriving is very special, and your whole family's support really means the world to me. Thank you, Martha, Sara, Barbara\nI have to say it's great to be back on the campaign trail. As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good. And I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances. But with just two months to go until Election Day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.\nBut it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift. I talked with some old friends. I spent time with our very sweet dogs. I did some thinking. The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. And that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about.\nPeople like me \u2013 we're lucky. When I'm under the weather \u2013 now, I just want to have a conversation, and other people can wave their arms and their signs. But I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky. When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can't. They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck, don't they?\nLots of Americans still don't even have insurance, or they do but it's too expensive for them to actually use. So they toss back some Tylenols, they chug orange juice, and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own.\nLots of working parents can't afford childcare, which in many states costs as much as college tuition. So for millions of moms and dads, if they get sick, there's no backup. They're on their own, aren't they?\nThat's the story for too many people still in America. When illness strikes, or an accident happens, you feel you're on your own. If you lose your job or can't afford college, you're on your own. If your aging parent starts needing more help, and you don't know what to do, you're on your own.\nLife events like these are catastrophic for some families, but mere bumps in the road for others. I have met so many people living on a razor's edge, one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home. And that goes against everything we stand for as Americans. Because some things should not come down to luck. Some things should be within reach for everyone, no matter what. Like financial security. Like affordable health care. Like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong, your family will be okay. And above all, the knowledge that no matter what, your president is fighting for you and will always have your back.\nThat right there, that's why I got into this race. I am running for everyone working hard to support their families, everyone who's been knocked down but gets back up. The factory workers on their feet all day, and the nurses looking after patients all night. I'm running for young people like so many of you here, who dream of changing our world for the better, and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education.\nI'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen. And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina. Look at what's happening with the NCAA and the ACC. This is where bigotry leads, and we can't afford it \u2013 not here, not anywhere else in America.\nI'm running for women like Janelle Turner. Back in May of last year, Janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through nearly six months of very tough treatments. Last October, she brought her eight-year-old daughter to one of our rallies in Iowa and they made a huge sign that read, 'Thirteenth chemo yesterday. Three more. Hear me roar!' Wouldn't you want to meet the woman behind that sign? Well, I sure did. So we got talking, and we've stayed in touch. She keeps promising me she'll see me at the inauguration. And I tell her I'll keep working to get there, but she'd better be there too.\nI'm running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids. But perhaps most of all, I'm running for those kids. Standing up for children has been the work of my life. As a lawyer with the Children's Defense Fund, as First Lady in Arkansas, in the White House, as a Senator, I have fought for kids housed in adult jails, kids who have been neglected and abused, kids who couldn't get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions, kids with disabilities so they could go to school. You heard today from someone I've known for a long time, now grown up and a lovely young woman, Anastasia Somoza. I learned from my family and my Methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can. And to me, that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their God-given potentials.\nSo when I meet a little girl in Nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported, it hits me right in the gut. When I meet a little boy in Flint, Michigan, who can't drink the water at home or in school because it's poisoned with lead, that gets me going. All I want to do is get to work making things better for them.\nThat's why I care so much about national security too. I want to give our kids a safer world. To me, that means a world with strong allies, more friends, fewer enemies, and fewer nuclear weapons. It also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet.\nMy opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts. Just a few days ago he said that if another country's troops taunted ours \u2013 not fired at them, but taunted them, just taunts \u2013 he'd responded \u2013 he would respond by blowing them out of the water. He would start a war over that. That is just one more reason, my friends, why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes.\nI've been involved in politics in one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I've built up some defenses. When it comes to public service, I'm better at the 'service' part than the 'public' part. But this is why I do it, and this is who I'm in it for: to make life better for children and families. And that's what this race has always been about for me.\nWell, now we're in the final stretch. There are just 54 days till Election Day. Just 54 days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes. And just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in North Carolina. Let's make these days count, particularly here, because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do \u2013 make it harder for young people to vote, harder for people of color, harder for people with disabilities, harder for the elderly. There can't be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person, every person of color, every person with a disability, every older person turns out and votes.\nSo in these final days, let's try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesn't often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs, to create opportunity, to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future. Let's talk about what really matters.\nAnd here's my promise to you. I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way I will serve as your president should you give me that great honor \u2013 focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families.\nNext week, I'll go to Philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people; in Florida, to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyone's contributions, in-cluding people with disabilities; then I'll be back here in North Carolina, to meet with more working families. From now until November 8th, everywhere I go, I'm going to talk about my ideas for our country. My campaign has rolled out detailed plans in 38 different policy areas \u2013 yes, somebody actually counted. Everything from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to fighting Alzheimer's to supporting people with autism. You see, I have this old-fashioned notion that if you're running for president, you should say what you plan to do, how you're going to get it done, and how you're going to pay for it. You can read it all on my website, hillaryclinton.com. We even put it in a new book called, you guessed it, Stronger Together. Get a copy of it because it tells you everything Tim Kaine and I intend to do.\nNow, like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare. I sweat the details, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the water in Flint, or how many North Carolina kids are in early enrichment programs, or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal. Because you know what? It's not a detail if it's your kid. It's not a detail if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.\nNow, I confess, I'll never be the showman my opponent is, and that's okay with me. Just look at \u2013 look at the show he put on with Dr. Oz today. But I am going to deliver for you and your family, just like I did for Sarah all those years ago with the Children's Health Insurance Program, that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is. And I'll tell you something else. People accuse me of all kinds of things. You probably have seen that. But nobody ever accuses me of quitting. And I will never give up, I'll never walk away, no matter how tough the going gets. I'm actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his.\nWe don't need a president who says the minimum wage is too high. We need a president who knows that Americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage. We don't need a president who wants to take away people's health coverage. We need a president who wants everyone to have quality, affordable health care. And we don't need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids. We don't need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms. We need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues, who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes. Ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side, respect your family, stand up and fight for you and your kids.\nThat is who you should vote for on November 8th because as Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between Democrat or Republican. It's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations. People have to decide, are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe, or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?\nNow, I have a lot of confidence in the American people and in our country. My opponent keeps running us down, saying we're weak, a disaster, an embarrassment. Every time he says things like that, I think about Janelle and her strength in the face of cancer, or Martha and Sarah in the face of their health challenges, and that little boy in Flint, who gets up every day and goes to school even though he can't drink the water. See, my opponent has America all wrong. There's nothing we can't do when we come together as one nation, set big goals, and pursue them.\nAnd the American dream \u2013 the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. So if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, that no one who works full-time should have to raise their child in poverty, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions, join us. If you believe \u2013 if you believe your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay, then join us. Get involved these last 55 days. Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246. We need volunteers right here in North Carolina. We can't do this without you.\nAnd remember, the presidential race isn't the only one this fall. We've got a lot of im-portant statewide races. Let's come together and send Deborah Ross to represent the people in the Senate. Starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. So the heat is on. Spread the word. Tell your friends, your family, your neighbors. If you share our vision for America's future, come be part of helping us shape it. We do not have a minute to lose.\nWe have so many blessings. Now it's our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person, and particularly every child, no matter who they are, what they look like, or who they love, is part of the American dream now and way into the future. Let that be our message. Let that be our mission. Please come out and help us fight, fight for you, fight for our children, fight for our families. Let's make America all that it should be. Thank you and God bless you!\"\n","103":"\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you.\nToday, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival \u2013 it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.\nMy plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.\nRight now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.\nLook no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM \u2013 today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.\nIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nWe are going to turn this around.\nMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.\nWe reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.\nEverything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.\nJobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.\nAll of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism \u2013 which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country \u2013 and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.\nUnder this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?\nIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.\nAmerica will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.\nInstead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.\nMy opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution \u2013 a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.\nThe only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.\nIn Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.\nNot one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.\nIn the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.\nIn many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.\nPoliticians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.\nWorse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable \u2013 how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?\nThe hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos \u2013 but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.\nThese are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice.\nI am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.\nToo many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.\nI'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States \u2013 and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.\nWe are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.\nIt's time to start thinking big once again.\nThat's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.\nIn working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math.\nThis growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.\nIt will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.\nIt will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.\nRight now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter \u2013 that translates to millions of lost jobs.\nThis is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nOver the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.\nPerhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.\nMeanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.\nOn top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt \u2013 it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.\nNow, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.\nInstead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.\nNever has so much money been spent so poorly.\nBut we're going to turn that all around. Here's how.\nIt begins with bold new tax reform.\nAs outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all \u2013 in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.\nBy lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.\nIn addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit \u2013 it won't even be close.\nThis is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.\nThe tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.\nThese proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.\nFamilies will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.\nParents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit \u2013 in the form a Childcare rebate \u2013 and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.\nA married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.\nA married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.\nBy contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.\nOne of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate \u2013 down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch.\nWe will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.\nOn top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.\nWe will turn America into a magnet for new jobs \u2013 and that means jobs in our poorest communities.\nNext, comes regulations.\nOne of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.\nRegulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry \u2013 and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.\nIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.\nI've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.\nThis includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.\nWe're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.\nEnergy reform is central to our plan as well\nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\nHillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.\nA Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will:\nincrease GDP by more than $100 billion annually\nadd over 500,000 new jobs annually\nincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years\nincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades\nincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\nIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama \u2013 creating countless more jobs in the process.\nFinally, comes trade \u2013 the foundation for everything\nAmerica's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year \u2013 an enormous drag on growth.\nBetween World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.\nPredatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.\nIt is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nThe verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted \u2013 every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.\nOur manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.\nI have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps:\nI'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators \u2013 and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.\nWe are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.\nWe are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nNext, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.\nI am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.\nIf China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.\nJust the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.\nWe are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.\nHere is how the plan adds up\nWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan.\nOur economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.\nThat leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade \u2013 again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.\nIf our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.\nThis is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.\nThis is what our new future will look like\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA \u2013 and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\nAnd we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this country.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","104":"\n\"Hello! Hello, CHCI! It is so great to be back here with so many friends and to see so many young people here because that fits the theme this year: educate, engage, vote. And I can't think of better marching orders for the next 54 days. [Cheers.] And anyone who just heard the congresswoman knows we cannot be on the sidelines. This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\nI want to recognize the Institute for all you do to inspire the next generation of Latino leaders. Last year, I had the chance to spend time with some of the CHCI interns and fellows. It really was like seeing the future of America in one room. I can't wait to see everything that they achieve. And I can't wait, if I'm fortunate enough to be president, to put some of them to work!\nAnd I want to thank all my friends in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. You fight every single day to lift up the Latino community \u2013 when the cameras are rolling and when the cameras are off, at home in your districts and here in Washington. And no one understands better than you the pivotal moment we're at right now \u2013 not just for Latinos but for our country.\nMy friends in the caucus have traveled to every battleground state, registered voters. You've stayed focused no matter what kind of outlandish and offensive comments we have heard from my opponent and his supporters. By the way, I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious.\nNow, here's a confession: Running for president is never easy, but it shouldn't be, right? But tonight I have the ultimate challenge: speaking after President Obama. He's always a tough act to follow, in more ways than one.\nI, for one, don't think the President gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from another Great Depression. Think of what we've achieved these last eight years. American businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession. Twenty million Americans have health coverage \u2013 and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act than Latino Americans. We got more good news this week. A report came out showing that poverty is going down, and incomes for American families are going up, and Latino families have seen the biggest increase of all.\nNow, that doesn't mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch. Our work is far from finished. But I am more confident than ever that our best days are still ahead of us. I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and it's big enough for everyone to share its promise. That doesn't mean that lots of people are still not hurting, because I know they are. And when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate, it's easy to get discouraged. But we're here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our America's future.\nEither we're going to make our economy work for everyone, or just those at the top.\nEither we're going to fear our differences, or embrace and celebrate our diversity.\nEither we're going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides, or we're going to be stronger together.\nToday, as you know, we're in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month. In classrooms across America, children will study Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, Juli\u00e1n and Joaqu\u00edn Castro, Justice Sotomayor, Roberto Clemente and Laurie Hernandez, Gloria Estefan and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and countless others \u2013 names we know and names we might not know, but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations.\nWhether you're Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Latin American, Afro-Latino, whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed [cheers], you're not strangers. You're not intruders. You're our neighbors, our col-leagues, our friends, our families. You make our nation stronger, smarter, more creative. And I want you to know that I see you and I am with you, and time and again \u2013 time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community, when we make it possible for Latinos to get the health care you need, get the education you desire, compete for jobs, start new businesses, pursue your dreams, all of America benefits.\nAs I said this afternoon in North Carolina, we are in the final stretch of this election. And I intend to close my campaign the way I began my career, fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. It will be the passion of my presidency. So tonight I want to mention two things I'll do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of America.\nFirst, we do need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth. We've got to work together to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages, with more opportunities to get the skills they need, to go to college, to launch new ventures, to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids. So we're going to make, in my first 100 days, the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, manufacturing, technology, innovative, clean energy.\nAnd we're going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small busi-nesses, including the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere. And I want to give a particular shout-out to Latina small business owners. Not everyone knows this, but you are among the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in America. And we're going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today. Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable childcare isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. When families are strong, America is strong.\nAnd that brings me to another important family issue. In those first 100 days, I will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the Congress. My proposal will keep families together, and it will include a path to citizenship. Now, I know this isn't the first time you've heard it. In fact, people have been making the same promise for more than a decade. But I believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on. I've been called a lot of things; I've never been called a quitter.\nAnd in this election \u2013 in this election, we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn't just the smart thing to do, it's what the American people demand. And you know how we'll show that? Well, I hope to have a Democratic Congress next January. [Cheers.] But no matter what, on my first day in office I will reach out to Republicans and say, this is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party, the party of Lincoln, is better than Donald Trump.\nAnd while we're fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, we're going to keep families together. When the deadlocked Supreme Court put DAPA and expanded DACA on hold for 5 million immigrants, it was devastating to millions of families. But the court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case. And as I've said repeatedly, I believe DAPA and expanded DACA are squarely within the President's authority, and will I protect them and keep fighting for them.\nBut in addition to defending DAPA and DACA, there's more we can do. We need a simple, straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too. Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses. And we won't stop there. We're going to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and roundups. No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home.\nSo here's the bottom line. Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy and enable America to be what it's always been \u2013 a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation.\nNow, I know this has been a long road and we wouldn't be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union, and we certainly wouldn't be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the United States by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others. They helped change the conversation. And when President Obama created DACA, it changed their lives.\nRight now, 750,000 undocumented young people in America are going to school, working, and planning for their future. They're DREAMers in much more than name. I've met so many. I've listened to their stories. They've done everything we've asked of them and made our country stronger in return.\nSo when Donald Trump promises to rip that all away on Day One, when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us, including American citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented, these are the faces I see.\nI picture Astrid Silva \u2013 who I met in Las Vegas. Many of you know her story: She came to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she's in her 20s, advocating for the rights of everywhere.\nI picture a young man I never met, whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story. His teacher told me that his former student was funny, enthusiastic, and patriotic. He played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005, proudly enlisted in the U.S. Army. Before shipping off to Iraq, he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform.\nHe was, his teacher wrote, 'as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom.' He was also a DREAMer, brought here as an undocumented child. He loved America, and hoped one day to earn his citizenship. But in April 2007, while on a mission in Baghdad, he was killed by an improvised explosive device. He was just 19. The Army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the American citizenship he'd always wanted.\nAll these years later \u2013 his teacher still treasures his memory. And this teacher wanted me to know \u2013 he wanted me to know that despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals. The truth is, this young man may not have been born here, but he represented the best values of our country.\nWe teach our children that America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way, but for all. Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric they've heard from my opponent \u2013 from the racist lie about Mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge.\nAnd every time we think he's hit rock bottom, he sinks even lower. His latest target? A minister in Flint, Michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks. He called her a nervous mess.\nHow insulting, how dead wrong. Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess \u2013 she's a rock for her community in trying times, and she deserves better and so does America. And again today, he did it again. He was asked one more time, 'Where was President Obama born?' And he still wouldn't still say 'Hawaii.' He still wouldn't say 'America.' This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\nNow, he's tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is. And so we need to decide who we are. If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are? We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric. We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear. We need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren\nParents and teachers are already worried about what they're calling the 'Trump Effect.' Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.\nAt a high school basket game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of 'Build the wall' and 'Speak English.'\nDonald Trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes. His message is you should be afraid \u2013 afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different, or whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country. There's no innuendo or dog whistles anymore. It's all right out there in the open now. So we've got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear.\nJust this week, a mother in Florida wrote to me about her 11-year-old son, Francisco. He's proud to be American, Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican. As he calls it, a 'potluck' of Hispanic heritage. And Francisco has been following this election very closely, his mother told me. He wears his 'Love Trumps Hate' pin every day and refuses to take it off. When his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies, Francisco looked his father in the eye and he said: 'I was always told to stand up for myself and what I believe in. And I believe Trump is wrong.' And good for you, Francisco.\nThat's what we have to do in this election, and that's what so many of you are doing already: standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from.\nTogether, we must send this resounding message, and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket.\nWe've set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted, and we can't do it without you. Nearly half of Latinos in America are under 35, and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election.\nSo we're going to keep asking for your help. Keep hitting the campaign trail. Please talk to your friends, your neighbors, your community \u2013 everyone you see between now and November 8th. Tell them to go to hillaryclinton.com, or text JOIN, J-O-I-N to 47246 to get involved. This election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines, as we heard from Congresswoman Sanchez.\nSo let's stand up for a future where we put families first. Where we build bridges, not walls.\nAnd yes, together we can prove love trumps hate. Thank you all very much.\"\n","105":"\nThank you, Ohio. It is so great to be in the great city of Canton.\nWe just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN. We're up five points in Ohio, and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide.\nThe people of the United States are ready for change. They're ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains, disrespects and looks down on hardworking people.\nThis election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C. versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens.\nFor years, our leaders have looked out only for themselves.\nThere is no greater example of this in our country than Flint, Michigan. The city of Flint was once known as Buick City. More than 80,000 workers were employed by GM in 1970 \u2013 today, its less than 8,000. Forty percent of the city's residents are living in poverty. Violent crime is among the nation's highest.\nToday I went to Flint, Michigan to address the water crisis. The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government.\nIt's tragic and it's heartbreaking, and it should never happen in the United States of America.\nThis is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own.\nIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nWe are going to turn this around. We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people.\nDriving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses, the dilapidated infrastructure.\nThis is what our politicians have done to this city, this is what our politicians have done to America.\nBut nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities. Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years. Their policies have produced massive poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.\nThey've trapped Americans in suffering for years, and I'm running to offer a better future. Lower crime, better schools, more jobs \u2013 safety, security, opportunity.\nNow, I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who aren't planning on voting for me right now. I will campaign hard for their votes \u2013 we can't stay the course our country is on. If you keep voting for the same people, you'll keep getting the same results.\nI am willing to campaign anywhere. I am willing to go anywhere, visit anywhere, even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support.\nHillary Clinton calls people who aren't supporting her deplorable and irredeemable. I call people who aren't supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else \u2013 and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote, in every last American community, right up until November 8th.\nI will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat, or that have voted Democrat for generations. I am running to be President for all Americans, to represent all Americans, and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence.\nThe economic policies of Hillary Clinton \u2013 on trade, on the economy, on immigration \u2013 have devastated the inner cities of America. Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution.\nHillary Clinton believes in globalism \u2013 taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the world \u2013 I am running to be President of the United States. I am running to bring hope to Flint, to Canton, and to every party of this country.\nIf we don't break free from our partisan boxes, then nothing will ever change \u2013 it's time to vote for America and America First.\nHillary Clinton's refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term. That's enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States.\nPresident Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions, bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just one single year.\nInstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees, we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans.\nOur support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black, white and Latino. You are moms and dads, children and grandparents, you are from cities small and large and in-between. But above everything else, you are all Americans.\nHillary Clinton's attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.\nNow the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress.\nThere is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale. Look at what she did with Russian Uranium, or with UBS bank, or with the contracts in Haiti.\nHillary Clinton's record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure. Just look at what she did to the Middle East \u2013 in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. Not to mention her failures in Russia, China and North Korea.\nOne failure after another \u2013 all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street.\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home.\n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled.\nI am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nThat begins with a new America-First trade policy.\nHillary Clinton's bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clinton's NAFTA, her support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and her support for the TPP \u2013 she called it the \"Gold Standard.\"\nOhio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO.\nOur trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.\nI will renegotiate NAFTA, I will defend your jobs, and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America.\nAmerica's trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved \u2013 which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance.\nWe won't let that happen. But you have to get out and vote.\nMy first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on American energy.\nAlso on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\nI will fight for you against the special interests, against the corrupt politicians, and against the powerful insiders. Let me be your champion.\nIn all things, it's time to put Americans first \u2013 and start taking care of each other.\nYesterday, I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.\nOn policy after policy, we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans.\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment [NRA endorsement]; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA \u2013 which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States \u2013 and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\nAnd Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States \u2013 not in China, and all over the world.\nWe don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again \u2013 like never before.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. We will rebuild our water infrastructure, and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission: clean air and safe water.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","106":"\nThank you. It is so great to be back in Iowa. Spending time in your state has been one of the great joys of this campaign.\nTogether, we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House, and Make America Great Again.\nThe White House will become the People's House. We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years.\nWe are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, free children from failing government schools, eliminate government waste, and create a fair, simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs.\nProsperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will finally begin to grow \u2013 and they will grow rapidly.\nThis is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people.\nIn recent days, we've rolled out one new policy idea after another \u2013 on taxes, on school choice, on foreign policy, on defeating terrorism, on rebuilding our military, on Veterans care, on unleashing American energy, and on the vital issue of trade.\nBy contrast, Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions, only hatred and derision.\nI am running to be a President for all Americans \u2013 Democrat, Republican, Independent, everyone. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion.\nOur support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation.\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.\nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.\nIt's this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear \u2013 including with a hammer \u2013 so the FBI couldn't see them, and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena. Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today.\nAnyone watching today's hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined.\nThis is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was, but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs \u2013 here we don't have either. This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation.\nWhether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, temperament and moral character to lead this country.\nIn the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office: \"she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office\u2026from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.\"\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas, and produced only failing schools, rising crime, job loss, shrinking incomes, and tragic poverty at home.\n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years.\nI am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.\nThat includes our family farms right here in Iowa.\nFamily farms are the backbone of this country. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms.\nWe are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, corn-based ethanol, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief.\nOur plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death \u2013 helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish.\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nThat means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers, help them export their goods, and grow family farming in America.\nMy first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on American energy \u2013 which means lower electricity prices for our farmers, and half a million new jobs a year.\nThat's just the beginning.\nAlso on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare \u2013 this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.\nBy the way, remember when Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, said the \"lack of transparency,\" was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \"the stupidity of the American voter.\" This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr. Gruber and Hillary Clinton \u2013 and the voters have had enough. They're taking their country back.\nAnother major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.\nThis will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.\nIt's time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.\nOur policies on taxes, trade, regulations and education will grow incomes, boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities.\nWe need a new civil rights agenda for our time, one that promises safe neighborhoods, great education, and secure jobs.\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.\nViolent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nOver 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year. There's a shooting on average every 2 hours.\nTo those suffering and hurting I say: what do you have to lose \u2013 vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it. I will bring back millions of jobs, higher wages, and great schools.\nI will make your communities safe.\nSafety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nNew video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse. The victims were dragged, then hung from meathooks, and then their throats were slit.\nThis is an evil, sadistic, monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country.\nWe know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows, and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country.\nMy opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits.\nInstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs.\nI support the construction of safe zones in the region, and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it.\nAt the same time, as we rebuild our military, we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share. Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense. I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden \u2013 and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nIn all things, it's time to put Americans first \u2013 and start taking care of each other.\nTonight, I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.\nOn policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.\nI am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment. I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA \u2013 which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States \u2013 and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\nAnd Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States \u2013 not in China, and all over the world.\nWe don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again \u2013 like never before.\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation \u2013 and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation.

I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country. She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today.\nI want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues.\nWe are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.\nOur campaign is about ideas. We're about solutions. I've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.\nI've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.\nRight now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things. I'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.\nWe must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.\nWe have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people. Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power.\nThose in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.\nThat means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids.\nWe want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone.\nThese solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force. Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.\nFor many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense \u2013 even more than housing.\nYet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area \u2013 and my opponent has no childcare plan.\nMany Americans are just one crisis away from disaster \u2013 a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home. There is no financial security.\nBut that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight. Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.\nThe first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America \u2013 including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians \u2013 to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.\nThey will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13.\nBecause of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.\nThe deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.\nImportantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions\nto their families and to our society. Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.\nFor low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax \u2013 a major relief for low-income parents. This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.\nNext, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account. Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free. Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans \u2013 you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them.\nImmediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.\nThe money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities. Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year \u2013 they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury. Instead, the funds rollover \u2013 so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.\nThese savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms\nI outlined last week.\nThe funds will remain in the account until the age of 18. Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.\nFor low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds \u2013 if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match. To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.\nThese Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.\nOur plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions. The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.\nBut to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities. We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.\nIn this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button \u2013 including services like nanny-sharing. Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.\nOur plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well. This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time. Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services. Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.\nFinally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave. This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing. By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit. This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.\nThere are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.\nOn Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings. Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.\nThese are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President. It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together \u2013 not as Republicans or Democrats \u2013 but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, love\nyour families, and want a better future for all Americans.\nIt's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people.\nIt's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.\nIt is time to Believe In America.\nTogether, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.\nWe Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.\nAnd Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone.\n","108":"\nThank you. I am honored to be here today. Let me extend my special gratitude to General Ashenhurst and General Hargett, and to each and every one of you.\nThe National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home, and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people.\nOur debt to you is eternal.\nYesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9\/11 attacks. The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City.\nSince 9\/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas \u2013 including those with multiple deployments. Right now, 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries across the world.\nMembers of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country.\nIf I am given the honor to serve as your President, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve.\nYou will have a true and loyal friend in the White House.\nWhether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. I will not let you down.\nI am running to be a President for all Americans \u2013 and I've been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform.\nAll across this country, I've met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community. There's nothing I've enjoyed more than the time I've spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics.\nThey embody the goodness and decency of our country.\nI was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear and demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign.\nOur support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future.\nThese were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized. These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American. She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book \u2013 she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic.\nShe called them a \"basket of deplorables\" in both a speech and an interview. She divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings.\nHillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street.\nShe and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh. They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on, paint the buildings she speaks in, and keep the lights on in her auditorium.\nHillary Clinton is an insider, supported by powerful insiders, attacking Americans who have no political power.\nHillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run.\nShe spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their families.\nWhile Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.\nAfter months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts.\nShe revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over.\nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her Foundation.\nIt's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria and in Libya.\nTo this day, she still won't take accountability for her role in unleashing ISIS across the Middle East \u2013 or for putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.\nHillary Clinton believes she is above the law, that she is above accountability, and that she is above each and every one of you.\nOur campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless. It's about representing the forgotten men and women of this country.\nI'm here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness.\nI am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless. I'm running to take on the special interests, the big donors, and the corrupt political insiders.\nI am running to be your voice.\nHillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for the top tenth of the one percent. Just look at the people funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and paying for her speeches, and you'll know who she represents.\nThe disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service.\nYou cannot run for President if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter. You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.\nHillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered. In fact, she hasn't backed down at all \u2013 she's doubled-down on her campaign of conspiracy and contempt.\nIf Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, then I don't see how she can credibly campaign.\nLet's be clear. These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton. These were not stray remarks in an interview, or an accidental choice of words. These were lengthy, planned, and prepared remarks \u2013 it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major-party presidential nominee.\nClinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic Playbook \u2013 smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change. She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people.\nShe used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform.\nPeople who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.\nPeople who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.\nPeople who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.\nHillary Clinton doesn't have to worry about Sanctuary Cities, or jobs moving overseas. She's protected from her own policies.\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes, and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.\nOur campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans.\nWe are the campaign of school choice.\nWe are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker.\nWe are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by and for the people.\nThis change agenda includes a new foreign and military policy.\nWe are going to put the failed policies of the past behind us.\nWe will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do \u2013 and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS.\nInstead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory.\nWe will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent, and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States.\nMy plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military, and the elimination of the defense sequester. In this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best, modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world.\nThe National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people.\nYou are there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike.\nYou are there to protect civilians in times of unrest.\nYou are there to respond to every natural disaster.\nYou deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution, and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done.\nIn a Trump Administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office.\nYou will have an Administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day.\nYou will have a President who supports, promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every turn.\nThe members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety and our country.\nWe will never forget our heroes, their families, and the ones they've left behind.\nOur gratitude is everlasting.\nWe will protect those who protect us.\nAnd we will follow your example of unity \u2013 working in common purpose and common cause.\nWe will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.\nWe will rebuild our military \u2013 and our country.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless you all.\n","109":"\nThis is our chance \u2013 our one chance \u2013 to fix our rigged system and create prosperity for each and every American.\nOur vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate.\nHillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas.\nBy contrast, I've been going around the country offering detailed plans for reform.\nAll of these reform plans are available on our website.\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.\nYou are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders. You are Democrats, Independents and Republicans.\nAbove all else, you are Americans \u2013 and you are entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you and defends you.\nEvery American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country.\nWhether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House.\nHillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors and the special interests.\nI will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute, but first let me invite onto the stage some people who can tell you themselves what they think of her spiteful comments.\nI have some more thoughts on Clinton's remarks I will be sharing momentarily, but first I want to tell you what I am going to do to make your life better.\nWe've outlined a detailed plan on trade, on immigration, on rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy.\nI've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism, on reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy, and on providing school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.\nWe've released policy after policy, solution after solution.\nEvery day, we are putting forward new ideas to make your life better.\nThe change will start right away, the moment I take my oath of office.\nOn my first day, we are going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama.\nThen, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight\nyears. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\nWe are going to lift the restriction on American energy \u2013 this will create another half a million new jobs a year.\nThat's just the beginning.\nOn my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare \u2013 this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.\nI am also going to propose a massive tax reduction to unleash prosperity in every city and state in our country.\nOn that first day, I am also going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing. I will use every lawful Presidential power to achieve relief for our workers.\nYou can read the full 7-point trade plan on my website, DonaldJTrump.com.\nNorth Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed it, and Hillary Clinton supported it.\nRight here in Ashville, you've lost 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Hillary-backed deal.\nHillary Clinton owes all of you an apology. And I think you'll get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton hands over the 33,000 emails she deleted.\nBy the way, Hillary Clinton destroyed her emails after she received a congressional subpoena. They used a special software called bleach bit.\nShe even made her 13 different phones disappear \u2013 some of them were even destroyed with a hammer.\nHillary Clinton obviously had a whole lot to hide, including her pay-for-play scandals at Secretary of State.\nPay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and family\nin Haiti.\nNothing is so dangerous to American Democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale.\nHillary Clinton believes she is above the law.\nShe also believes that she is above all of you.\nAfter months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country.\nShe said tens of millions of patriotic Americans belong in a \"basket of deplorables.\" She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings.\nShe said half of our supporters are not even real Americans, and describes the other half as having run out of options \u2013 what she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through the lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment. They want change, they want justice, and they want a government that puts the American people first.\nWhether our supporters have lost a job to a factory moved to another country, or whether they're a captain in the police department, or a teacher at a local school, they are united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people.\nFor those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country.\nHillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working class Americans. She looks down on them \u2013 she looks down on all the people who make her life possible. She looks down on the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, lawyers and accountants. She looks down on the police officers, soldiers, and firefighters supporting our campaign.\nShe looks down on the people who cook her meals, drive her cars, and dig the coal that powers her electricity.\nShe called these Americans every name in the book \u2013 racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic \u2013 she said they were not even American.\nNever in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter.\nShe was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans.\nWhat should these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks?\nTo every kid in America tonight, I want you to know: your parents are working so hard to make your life better, and to make your country better \u2013 and if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside them to deliver a better future for everyone.\nClinton made her remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street. Her goal is simple: to bully the American voter out of voting for change.\nThe people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are. They want to keep our terrible trade deals. They want to trap children in failing government schools. They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete.\nHillary Clinton can never be President of this country. No one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their President.\nEarlier today I had a chance to spend some time with some more of our most amazing Americans.\nI spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States.\nThese are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters, and who fight our wars.\nThese heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation.\nWe also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThere is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and its people.\nOur debt to them is eternal and everlasting.\nOne thing that we must do is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment, resources and tools in the world.\nWe must provide them the best medical care while they serve, and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life.\nThe Veterans scandals that have occurred under this Administration \u2013 and that have been dismissed by my opponent \u2013 are a permanent stain on this government. It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself.\nWe must take care of our Veterans. That includes giving Veterans the right to choose treatment at either a public VA facility, or the private doctor of their choice.\nJust today we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its\nperformance records available to consumers.\nThe scandals never seem to end \u2013 but they will, when I'm elected President.\nNothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who hear the uniform.\nWe've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals, these are the people who know how to keep our country safe.\nJust today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients. I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have the support of these intrepid heroes.\nAlso, today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, is now a senior advisor to our campaign.\nWe are on a mission of change.\nThat includes a new agenda for our inner cities.\nThe Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.\n4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.\n2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nFor those suffering and hurting, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. I will fix it. What do you have to lose?\nLet me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of new jobs, higher wages, and amazing schools.\nI will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.\nIn this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans \u2013 and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.\nWe will keep our children safe \u2013 which includes steadfast support for American law enforcement.\nJobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nGovernment corruption will end.\nHonesty will be restored.\nRepublicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe will make America prosperous again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd will Make America great again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","110":"\nIt is so great to be back in Florida, my second home. Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans.\nLet me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.\nDecades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.\nThe citizens of this country will be in charge once more.\nThe special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing.\nThe history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.\nThis will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nAll we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.\nChange is coming.\nAll the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.\nIt's your turn now. This is your time.\nThe fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change \u2013 not partisan change.\nWe are fighting for all Americans \u2013 Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals \u2013 who've been failed by this corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.\nWe're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.\nHillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.\nOurs is the campaign of the future.\nIn this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first \u2013 and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.\nOur trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over.\nWe will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.\nIn this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.\nMy tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years.\nThe people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton \u2013 much of it to her personal bank account \u2013 to keep you from having the future you deserve.\nBut on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.\nIn this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.\nIn this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career.\nTo keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength.\nThat means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.\nWe are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.\nWe will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.\nAs we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.\nJust today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.\nOne more massive Hillary Clinton failure.\nJust like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.\nHillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder.\nShe handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.\nShe helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.\nShe helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too \u2013 without any plan for the day after.\nShe failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.\nAnd of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia \u2013while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.\nLet's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch.\nUnlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength \u2013 not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nThe difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.\nHillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.\nThat is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world \u2013 so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.\nIf I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing.\nI will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.\nBut I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.\nWe will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn.\nAmerica will get the respect it deserves.\nAnd if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.\nOn these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace \u2013 for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future.\nHillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.\nHer policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change \u2013 but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.\nHer only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.\nShe lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.\nBy the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.\nAnd we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.\nHillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.\nI just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.\nThroughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.\nMy Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nThe insiders fighting for insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nAll the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.\nI am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win \u2013 and how to avoid endless war.\nLet me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.\nThere is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.\nIt is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.\nWe will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States \u2013 not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.\nAnd we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nThe fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape.\nAny country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.\nWe will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.\nWe simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now.\nThat applies to everything.\nChange is needed at every single level of our society.\nWhen I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.\nI want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.\nThe possibilities for our future are unlimited.\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.\nIf we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.\nThat also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist \u2013 now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.\nWhen I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone \u2013 but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.\nWe are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.\nNew schools, new factories, new infrastructure.\nBeautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.\nMost importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.\nHere, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans \u2013 from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.\nThese incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.\nTo all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion.\nAll working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.\nIn particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.\nI've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine.\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.\nThis is our chance.

Thank you very much. Oh, Jon. Jon is such a great actor and such a great person. He is such a great person. And he's really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways. He's been incredible. So I just want to thank Jon. And I hope he makes another movie very quickly, because I love his movies. [laughter]\nIn particular, I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership. [applause] And we know all about that. And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana, where two weeks ago I spent some time, and I saw some incredible, incredible people.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!\nMR. TRUMP: Thank you. [applause] Amazing, amazing group.\nOne of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time I've spent with the evangelical community. And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible, I have to tell you. [applause] All across the nation. A lot of people said: I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals. I got the evangelicals. [cheers and applause] I'm going to make it up to you too, you watch. There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States. [applause]\nTrue. So true. I've witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land, gotten to know so many people. I saw it during my trip to Louisiana, where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need. Franklin Graham is an example. He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana. [cheers and applause] And he didn't want anything for it. He's a great man. It's that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country, which is in serious, serious trouble. [cheers and applause]\nYet, our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith. And you understand that. All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in today's media environment.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Right!\nMR. TRUMP: It is right, isn't it? [laughter] Yeah, it is right. [applause] Not even close. Your values of love, charity and faith built this nation. [cheers and applause] So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly? One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent. And Hillary Clinton, you can forget about her. [laughter and jeers]\nSo let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you've never seen before. [cheers and applause] Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty \u2013 remember, remember. [cheers and applause] I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit, Great Faith Ministries International. Stand up if you're member. That's good. That was a great \u2013 that was an amazing experience. [applause] And the bishop, what a great guy.\nIn my remarks, I spoke about how African American church \u2013 and this is all across the country \u2013 for centuries have been the conscience of our nation. Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history, leading us all to a better future. Very true. Amazing. This was such an amazing experience. [applause] This is the power of faith. It's the power to heal. It's the power to unite. It's the power to make all of us live better lives \u2013 all of us. [cheers and applause]\nOur nation today is divided. Nobody likes to say it, but we're living in a very, very divided nation. It will be our faith in God and his teachings, in each other, that will lead us back to unity. [cheers and applause]\nEach of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together, united in common purpose and in common values. So let's talk today about some of the things \u2013 and these are great things \u2013 that we can do together to create the American future for everybody, not just a certain group of people, but for everybody.\nThe first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back. It's been taken away. [cheers and applause] The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits. If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status.\nAll religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings \u2013 [cheers and applause] \u2013 on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson amendment \u2013 [cheers and applause] \u2013 if I am elected your president, I promise. [cheers and applause] So important.\nThank you. That's so important.\nAnd I must tell you from the heart, this started, a building of mine in Manhattan. I had 50 pastors in a big conference room. And we actually had 50 pastors, two rabbis, a couple of priests. We were all talking. And we were there for two hours. And at the end, it was a love-fest. We all agreed. It was like a love-fest.\nAnd I said to them \u2013 we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue \u2013 and I said to them I'd love your support. And I know when I can get support. I'm quite sophisticated. [laughter] And I know they wanted to give me their total support, 100 percent, just like I had in the primaries. And I said I really would like your support. And they didn't really know what I was talking about. And I said, what's going on here? They said, well, sir, we can't do that because we would be violating the laws. And I said, what's the punishment? Well, we could lose our tax-exempt status, which, of course, is a, you know, massive penalty.\nI said, tell me about this. And we sat down. They talked about it. When did it happen? 1954 or so. Lyndon Johnson was having problems \u2013 powerful guy. I actually, as just own way \u2013 you have to gain respect for what he was able to do. Can you imagine that this man single-handedly \u2013 he was having problems with churches. And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason. And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status.\nSo we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk. And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty. And one of the pastors, who I knew very well \u2013 and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just \u2013 and magnificent hearts, much more importantly \u2013 they looked at me and they said, that's actually right. They have more power than we do. We're not allowed to express.\nAnd that's what I said. We have to start thinking about this. And I thought about it. And then we had a large group of pastors again. I said I have thought about it. If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment. We are going to do that. And it's not going to be hard. It's not going to be hard. [cheers and applause]\nWhen you \u2013 when you think, from the standpoint of political, you have more than men \u2013 let's say men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent. You're much more than 50 percent, added together. And I actually believe that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship \u2013 like our polls have been going in the last four weeks, a rocket ship, right? [cheers and applause] I really believe that, because you're great people. The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week, they've been stopped from talking and speaking by a law. And we're going to get rid of that law and it's going to get rid of \u2013 we're going to get rid of it so fast.\nAnd I'm so proud to say \u2013 honestly, I don't want to take credit, but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second. I am so proud \u2013 I was just telling this to Tony \u2013 to say that was my idea. I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven, so this is going to be very \u2013 [laughter] \u2013 the only way. [applause] So we're going to get rid of it, and we're going to let your great people speak, and you're going to see something happen that's going to be very, very good, OK? So important.\nI hope \u2013 which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th. You cannot \u2013 you didn't vote four years ago. You didn't vote.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I did.\nMR. TRUMP: You did? Well, you did. A few of you did. [laughter] Believe me, I know. I look at the stats. You didn't vote. But this time you really have \u2013 and this is your last chance. This is it. I mean, we'll never have this opportunity again. So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up \u2013 your family and your friends, and get out and vote, OK? November 8th. [cheers and applause] Thank you. [cheers and applause] And if you do, we're going to win by a lot. That's not going to even be a close election. And if you don't, could be a very unhappy November 8th.\nWe're also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare \u2013 [cheers and applause] \u2013 which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens. And the numbers are horrendous. Your premiums are going up by 50, 60, 70 percent. The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period \u2013 very, very long. It is a disaster. It's a disaster, and everybody knows it. And it's going to die of its own weight anyway, but we're going to get rid of it and we're going to replace it with some great, great alternatives \u2013 much better health care at a much lower price. [cheers and applause]\nHillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care, which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America. That's what she wants. That's what she's aiming at. That's what Obama wanted. He didn't quite get there, but he got this, and you see how bad this has been.\nOne of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice. [cheers and applause] And I can't possibly emphasize this enough. Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools. This education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more so than the African-American community \u2013 none. The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50, 60, 70 years, some cases over a hundred years \u2013 over a hundred years. Their policies and their politics, and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime.\nWhen she was running for the Senate in New York State, she said she was going to produce jobs, jobs, jobs in Upstate New York. It's a disaster. She's going to produce jobs, big thing \u2013 jobs, we're going to bring back jobs. Been a catastrophe. We've lost tens of thousands of jobs. She never did a thing. It was all talk, no action, just like what she's doing right now is all talk, no action. She'll talk and talk, and nothing will happen. Only bad will happen. But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York. She won because of them, and she produced absolutely nothing. Jobs left. It's today one of the worst, one of the most depressing places in this country. So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs. I know jobs. She doesn't know jobs. That I can tell you. [cheers and applause]\nI have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time \u2013 the right to a safe community, a great education and a secure job. [applause]\nAnd I say to African-American parents, I say to Hispanic American parents \u2013 and I say it with great respect \u2013 our inner cities are a disaster \u2013 crime, no jobs, education is the worst, in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad. I say, with great respect, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse. You choose Donald Trump, I'm going to fix the problem. You're going to have safety. [applause] You're going to have good education. We're going to get jobs, because we're going to bring our jobs back. Mexico's taking our jobs. So many other places, they're taking our jobs. What China's doing to us is horrible. We're going to have jobs. What do you have to lose? I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix it. [cheers and applause]\nSchool choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice. Competition \u2013 the schools the schools will get better and better and better. [cheers and applause]\nAnd that means a private school, a religious school, a charter school or a magnet school. School choice also means that parents can home-school their children. [cheers and applause] Hundred percent.\nHillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally, totally, like a puppet, by special interests. Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools, leading to higher unemployment and more poverty. The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe.\nMy plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children \u2013 [applause] \u2013 including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country, every single one of them. [cheers and applause]\nThis proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs. [applause] However \u2013 that's good, right? [applause] However, because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level, I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs. [applause]\nIf we do this, that would mean $12,000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America. What a difference this is going to make. The money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family. In so many ways, you're going to have choice.\nMy administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city \u2013 anybody \u2013 anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program \u2013 and there will be a lot of them \u2013 to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 in funds available per student.\nAs your president, I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice you've ever seen. [cheers and applause] This means a lot to me, because I know it can turn things around. Again, the education can't get worse. Commo Core \u2013 we're going to end it. [cheers and applause] We're bringing education local.\nI will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures. The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again, and I'm going to bring back jobs, and I'm going to bring back the great education. Don't be surprised \u2013 remember this, November 8th \u2013 don't be surprised, because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks, if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago. You see what's going on? [cheers and applause]\nThey're starting \u2013 people are starting to hear about this. And they're saying, wow. Wow. They're liking it. And again, can't get any worse. It's going to get a lot better. But only if I do it. They can't do it. The Democrats, they have \u2013 what they've done is incredible. And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same \u2013 rigid. It'll never change. Remember, a hundred years, 70 years, 50 \u2013 it's not going to change. Not going to happen.\nNow, let's talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come, the United States Supreme Court. [cheers and applause] Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia. The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others. It could even be \u2013 I mean, we could end up with a total of five judges by one president. It would be record-setting. Probably be three. Could be four. Could even be five. And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster.\nOne of the most important issues, frankly \u2013 other than maybe defense, because we're going to build up our military, it's so depleted. [cheers and applause] We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to protect your Second Amendment, so many things. But one of the most important \u2013 some people think it's actually the most important \u2013 is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court. You see what's happening right now? Essentially it's four and four. And you see what \u2013 how bad it is. We're going to pick great judges. I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people. And we are going to put truly great people. Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what we're looking for, OK? [cheers and applause]\nThis will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly. That's what's going to happen. I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written. [cheers and applause] We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans. We're not going to have that. I've made public a list of judges, as I said, that will guide my selection process. Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list. And we brought it up.\nLet's see a list. You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well. [laughter] Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public. They'd be rejected. Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty \u2013 not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four. If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably \u2013 as you know it \u2013 you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye. And we don't want to see that.\nAnother issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security. Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test \u2013 its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state. [cheers and applause] Failed at everything. Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power. They were dying three years ago. The sanctions were choking them. They would have fallen. But Obama didn't support people that would have taken over, and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support.\nBut you look at what's happened to Iran in such a short period of time. But remember the ransom payments. Remember, it was $400 million two weeks ago. But then they made a mistake. This is cash. Remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn't open a bank account. There was no way of sending it into a checking account. [laughter] All lies, just like Obamacare was a big lie, remember? You can use your plan. You can use your doctors \u2013 27 times, right? Twenty-seven times. You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie. It's all a lie. It's all a big lie. It's a rigged system and it's a lie.\nAnd I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. The 400 million (dollars), for those that haven't been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash \u2013 cash. And I actually said \u2013 they said, oh, that money's going to be used for terror. I said, no, they don't need it for terror. They've got 150 billion (dollars). That's in addition to the $150 billion that we're giving back. I said they don't need it. This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts. They're not going to use it for terror. They have plenty of money for terror.\nThink of it \u2013 $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash \u2013 massive, big vats of cash. You saw them \u2013 cartons. I never saw anything like it. I've seen a lot of cash. [laughter] Hey, never saw anything like this \u2013 $1.7 billion (dollars). Can you imagine these guys? Planes get \u2013 they stop. Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages. They waited there for hours and hours. And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do \u2013 even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something. It was this \u2013 just another lie.\nBut can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai, yai, yai. They think we're stupid. [laughter] They think we're stupid. They won't be thinking it for long. [cheers and applause] Very sad. [cheers and applause]\nAt the same time, ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross. ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East. We cannot let this evil continue \u2013 can 't let it. [cheers and applause] ISIS must be destroyed \u2013 have to; have no choice.\nTo defeat ISIS, we must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare. It's a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago \u2013 different world.\nWe must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism \u2013 [cheers and applause] \u2013 words that our president won't use and words that Hillary Clinton won't use. Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy, so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism.\nBy the way, President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more. But it's almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria. They take others, but they don't take Christians \u2013 very, very, very rare.\nSo I said that we need to make safe zones in the region. We want to take care of people. But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue, and we have to stop this. This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country. It's from within. This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. This could be it.\nYou ever notice on the \u2013 you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones. Cellphones. And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them. And some of them have things far worse than that \u2013 scenes far worse than that.\nSo it was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place. If they did the right thing, you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now. [applause] Now she wants to get rid of \u2013 oh, we're going to get rid of them. You know, she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground. Now, even if you don't want boots on the ground, you don't want to say it. Don't say it! Now they're saying, oh, I hope she wins. Oh, boy, would they dream of having her as president. Can you \u2013 [laughter] \u2013 they dream about it every night, having Hillary Clinton. But even if you believe \u2013 and I can understand that. No boots on the ground, I can understand. You don't say it! Let them think they're going to go through hell. Don't say it! [cheers and applause]\nCan you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine the great General George Patton, or one of our great generals that we have today \u2013 General Flynn, who's here someplace \u2013 [cheers and applause] \u2013 I love General Flynn \u2013 but can you imagine these people saying \u2013 I mean, they're basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground. If you don't want that, I fully understand. Don't say it! Don't say it! Could you imagine MacArthur saying we're going to fight the enemy, and we're going to move our troops in in about a month, we're going to hit from behind? [laughter] We're going to hit them from the front, then \u2013 and everything they say turns out to be true? You know, I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room, but maybe we shouldn't be so honest when it comes to military strategy. Does that make sense? [laughter and applause] Hope I didn't lose your vote for saying that. [applause]\nJust look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq, Syria and Libya. The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She really is. She's trigger-happy, and yet she says no boots, which is sort of \u2013 probably will be boots, you know. Probably will turn out to be another disaster. He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death. She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change with people we don't even know who they are. And they take over, and they're far worse. This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS.\nMy administration, on the other hand, will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And by the way, that includes Russia. If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I'm concerned. [cheers and applause] It's a very imperfect world, and you can't always choose your friends. That's life.\nBut you can never fail to recognize your enemies. We have some real enemies. Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails. These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena. What's that? Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never, ever see them. She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them, and many were destroyed with a hammer. [laughter] Did anybody ever hit a hammer \u2013 you know, maybe two or three people, but they were just released from prison, those two people. [laughter] Can you believe this? Destroyed them with a hammer \u2013 the old-fashioned way, I guess. [laughter]\nThe other night in the Commander in Chief Forum \u2013 did anybody see that? [cheers and applause] How did I do? [cheers] Good. Well, we have a big debate coming up. Who knows what's going to happen there? But I will say, every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief. [cheers and applause] We had \u2013 the polls came out after that event and we won big league. Now we have a debate coming up. I don't imagine any of you going to be watching the debate, right? [laughter and cheers]\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't take her bait. Don't take her bait.\nMR. TRUMP: I won't; I promise. Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly. That's why she lost. That's why she did so poorly. She was terrible. She was \u2013 honestly, I shouldn't be saying this \u2013 she was terrible. [laughter] She keeps talking about the emails. Every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently. [laughter] It seems each week, true, she has, like, a different answer. But there can be no answer when she deletes 33,000 emails, bleaches them so they can never be recovered \u2013 an unheard-of practice \u2013 hammers them into total silence. You know what happening. You know what's happening.\nI always say, getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career. [laughter and cheers] It's true. It's true. [cheers and applause] So her answers were bad. They were bad. And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest. And you know, she was blaming Matt Lauer. I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job. I mean, his questions to me were very tough. [applause] But the gentleman who stood up and said: Honestly, you should be in prison for what you did \u2013 [jeers] \u2013 to me, that was the tough one. [laughter] That was the tough \u2013 hey, that was a tough question. [laughter] It was sort of a question in the form of a statement, right? [laughter]\nHillary Clinton is unfit to be our president, for many reasons. [cheers and applause] True. True. [cheers and applause] She's unfit for many reasons, the biggest of which is her judgement. It's just so bad. [laughter] It's time to restore honestly and integrity to our government. [applause] Have to do it.\nAnd one more issue, finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy, and helping those in need. There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians. [applause] And all of us through \u2013 and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty. Going to do it, with a lot of other people going to help. As you president, I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country \u2013 millions of new jobs. [cheers and applause] We've lost our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. They've gone to other countries. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to many other countries. China's taking massive advantage of us. It's all so easy, believe me. It's all so easy.\nThat includes, we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses. [cheers and applause] It includes, very importantly, the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations. [cheers and applause] It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy, which is under siege. [cheers and applause] I will also renegotiate NAFTA. And if they don't want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway, not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs, we will terminate NAFTA, believe me. [cheers and applause] We'll stand up to China, and we're going to fight for every last job. It's going to be America first, and it's going to be the American worker first. [cheers and applause]\nCrucially, I will also fight for the American family and American family values. The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda. Has to be. [cheers and applause] Thank you.\nOur country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly. Great woman, really great woman. [applause] We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis. [cheers and applause]\nPhyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America. She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or to politicians. The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God. Phyllis understood that. [cheers and applause] Phyllis understood that.\nAnd by the way, Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago, when it wasn't necessarily \u2013 [cheers] \u2013 something that was so easy to do. And she was incredible. She was so brave. She endorsed me, and that was not the thing to do at the time. People said, Trump? She said, he's going to win, you don't understand. He knows how to win. He's going to win. [applause] They said, Phyllis, not going to be Trump. And we went boom, boom, boom. But I will tell you, Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasn't necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that. That had a huge impact. She was a great, great, powerful woman with a tremendous heart. And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow, because you really \u2013 that's a celebration. She was 92 years old. [cheers and applause]\nWe are all equal, and we all come from the same Creator. If we remember that simple fact, then our future is truly limitless. There is nothing we as Americans can't do.\nThere's a biblical verse that I have often read, and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what we're trying to achieve right now for our country. It's from 1 John, Chapter 4: \"No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us.\"\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Amen.\nMR. TRUMP: So true. [cheers and applause] So true. [applause]\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag. [cheers and applause] It's time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country.\nThis is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017, we will be one American nation. It's time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future. Have to do it. Together, we will make America believe again, we will make America united again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, and God bless you. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]\n","112":"\nThank you. It's great to be here today.\nIn particular, I want to thank Mr. Ron Packard and Ms. Deborah Mays for hosting me at their school.\nToday, we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign: school choice.\nBut before we do, I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clinton's emails. According to the FBI report: \"The FBI did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact, and, in doing so, obtained emails sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account.\"\nRemember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program \u2013 among many other extremely sensitive matters.\nThis is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief. By the way, the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night, where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism, and made us less safe than ever before.\nThroughout it all, she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State. These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia, doing favors for UBS bank, and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.\nIt's all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation.\nAs part of her criminal cover-up, Hillary Clinton's staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena. Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer.\nThen, when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn't remember important events 39 times. She couldn't even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information. She even said she didn't know that the letter \"C\" stood for confidential classified information.\nAll the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests, the world fell apart. Hillary Clintons' policies produced ruin in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. She failed in Russia, in China, in North Korea.\nHer policies unleashed ISIS, spread terrorism, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons \u2013 not to mention the ransom payments.\nOn top of it all, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She's raced to invade, intervene, and topple regimes. She believes in globalism, not Americanism.\nLast night, she even falsely said no American died in Libya. Then she also falsely said there's no ground troops in Iraq, even though we have 5,000 military personnel there right now.\nIraq is one of the biggest differences in this race. I opposed going in, and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out \u2013 letting ISIS fill the void.\nBut I was opposed to the war from the beginning.\nLong after Howard Stern, but three months before the Iraq war started, I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, that \"perhaps [we] shouldn't be doing it yet,\" and that \"the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.\"\nThen, On March 25th of 2003, just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is \"a mess,\" yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.\nIn July of 2003, I said that \"I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly.\" I had a number of quotes to this effect.\nThen, in August of 2004, very early in the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine.\n\"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\nWhat was the purpose of the whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!\nI would have been tougher on terrorism. Bin Laden would have been caught long ago.\"\nHad I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition. For years, I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clinton's failed career.\nHere is the bottom line: I was a private citizen. I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had. But in Iraq, my judgement was right and hers was wrong.\nHillary Clinton is always complaining about what's wrong, but she's been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it \u2013 all you have to do is look at New York State, when she was a Senator. All talk, but nothing happened.\nWe're on track to spend $6 trillion altogether on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nMeanwhile, massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepair.\nIt's time to rebuild America.\nToo many Americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the American Dream.\nWe are one nation, and when any part of our country hurts \u2013 our whole country hurts.\nMy goal as President will be to ensure that every child in this nation \u2013 African-American, Hispanic-American, all Americans \u2013 will be placed on the ladder of success: a great education, and a great job.\nThat ladder rests on a fundamental foundation: safety.\nIn order to help our children succeed, our first duty is to ensure that every kid in America can grow up in a safe community.\nYou can't have prosperity without security.\nThis is the new civil rights agenda of our time. The right to a safe community, a quality education, and a secure job.\nOur campaign represents the long-awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.\nThere is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly.\nThe Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success.\nIt is time to break-up that monopoly.\nI want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom \u2013 the civil right \u2013 to attend the school of their choice. This includes private schools, traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice.\nOur government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative \u2013 with billions left over. It's simply a matter of putting students first, not the education bureaucracy.\nLet's run through the numbers.\nAt the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year. That's an average of about $12,296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools.\nThe federal government pays for about 10 percent\u2014$64 billion, to be precise\u2014of the K-12 costs. That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S. Department of Education.\nThe other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states.\nWe spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. Yet, our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries.\nOur largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools.\nNew York City spends $20,226 dollars per pupil.\nBaltimore spends $15,287 dollars per student.\nChicago spends $11,976 dollars per student, and in Los Angeles it is $10,602.\nJust imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money \u2013 allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice.\nNot only would this empower families, but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes.\nThese schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family \u2013 not the needs of the Teachers' Union. There is no more important job than a teacher, and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms.\nThe current government monopoly, while great for the bureaucrats, has utterly failed too many students.\nAccording to the National Assessment of Education Progress, only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading.\nFailing schools then contribute to failing economies.\nIn Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent. In Baltimore, it is 16.2 percent, 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City.\nIn Los Angeles, 26 percent of African American women live in poverty. In Baltimore, the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent. In New York, over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty.\nNationwide, nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty \u2013 including 45% of children under the age of six.\nOur public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success.\nMeanwhile, we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities \u2013 which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for America's children.\nViolent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015. Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%. There have been nearly 3,000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year.\nGovernment is failing our citizens at every level.\nThat is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America.\nThat means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public, private or religious school of their choice.\nHere is how it will work.\nRight now, about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide. These are opportunity scholarships, tax credits, and education savings accounts. This covers about 400,000 students in our country.\nAltogether, school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide.\nCharter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration.\nThey also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone.\nMy first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice. This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars.\nSpecifically, my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty.\nWe will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend. Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws, encouraging them to participate.\nThis $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students.\nA state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds. Ohio is a leader in school choice. Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30,000 students, and 384 charter schools serving 123,844 students.\nBut the $20 billion is only the beginning. As President, I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty.\nThat means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public, private, charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family.\nEach state will develop its own formula, but we want the dollars to follow the student.\n9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level. To achieve this long-term goal, we will have to make this a shared national mission \u2013 to bring hope to every child in every city in this land.\nI will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states, and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city, state and federal level who support school choice.\nMy Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America \u2013 Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit \u2013 that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 funds available per student.\nI am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore.\nIf we can put a man on the moon, dig out the Panama Canal, and win two World Wars, then I have no doubt that we, as a nation, can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.\nIf the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.\nThe money will follow the student. That means the student will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice \u2013 and each state will develop its own system that works best for them.\nAs your President, I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice. I understand many stale old politicians will resist. But it's time for our country to start thinking big once again. We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.\nI will also support merit-pay for teachers, so that we reward great teachers \u2013 instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones.\nAt the same time, we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college.\nMy policies will add millions of new jobs to our country, especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities.\nMy plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year.\nBy reducing radical regulation and over-taxation, we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities.\nCrucially, my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America. We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world \u2013 that's money coming straight out of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, and so many others. By ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices, we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America.\nThe future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children.\nAll we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past. We've had a failed foreign policy. A failed education policy. A failed economic policy. And, underneath it all, a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have \u2013 or how many journalists they know \u2013 not how many Americans they help to live better lives.\nBut the failures of the past are about to end.\nThose failures end beginning on November 8th.\nWe will have One American Nation.\nWe will be One American People.\nWe are fighting to give every child, in every forgotten stretch of this country, the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace.\nThat means a safe neighborhood, a quality education, and a secure high-paying job.\nThis is how we will rebuild our future.\nThis is how We Will Make America Great Again \u2013 For Everyone.\nThank you.\n","113":"\nToday, I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy: Peace Through Strength.\nWe want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.\nI am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America's core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world. This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.\nWe can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.\nI'm proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win \u2013 and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now. Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.\nIn a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism. The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.\nGradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.\nWe should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission. We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nImmediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.\nThis will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare \u2013 as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.\nInstead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world \u2013 just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.\nWe will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.\nAt the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.\nWe only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.\nThese are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.\nUnlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction. Hillary Clinton's legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering. Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.\nIncluding Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner. Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton's policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.\nMeanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent. Russia has defied this Administration at every turn. Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.\nSometimes it has seemed like there wasn't a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn't want to invade, intervene or topple. She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.\nHillary Clinton is just reckless \u2013 so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack. Then Clinton's team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails. They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice. These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.\nIn the FBI report, she claimed she couldn't recall important information on 39 occasions.\nShe can't even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn't even know the letter \"C\" means confidential.\nIf she can't remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.\nHer conduct is simply disqualifying.\nShe talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton's only foreign policy experience is \"failure.\" Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.\nLet's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.\nLibya was stable.\nSyria was under control.\nEgypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.\nIraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.\nIran was being choked off by economic sanctions.\nFast-forward to today. What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?\nLibya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.\nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. And hundreds of thousands are dead.\nIn Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.\nIraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.\nISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.\nIran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States \u2013 plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments. In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.\nWorst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.\nThis is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.\nBut that's not all. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.\nHistory shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.\nUnder Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II. We currently have the smallest Army since 1940. The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915. And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.\nWhen Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships. When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships. Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.\nThe average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old. We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers \u2013 their fathers flew the same plane.\nOur Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.\nIn 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines. Today, it's just 182,000.\nOur ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions. President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troops\u2014which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.\nIt takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.\nIn 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.\nIn the current year, we are spending $548 billion \u2013 a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars. This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts. Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts \u2013 even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.\nAs soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.\nThis will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.\nAs part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending. In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.\nI will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks \u2013 and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.\nGovernment-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.\nWe can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition \u2013 that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.\nWe can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law. Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws. Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.\nThe military will not be exempt either \u2013 the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.\nEarly in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now. Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.\nAdditionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.\nFinally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy. The Institute for Energy Research cites a \"short-run\" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.\nUsing these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:\nWe will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army's chief of staff has said he needs. We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.\nWe will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies \u2013 we have 23 now.\nWe will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel \u2013 we have 276 ships now.\nAnd we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions \u2013 we have 1,113 now.\nWe will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.\nUnder Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea. As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.\nWe propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.\nWe will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.\nAs we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.\nAccomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort \u2014every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow.\nIn addition, we will improve the Department of Defense's cyber capabilities. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.\nWhich is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.\nHillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department. Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.\nWe will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.\nOne of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities \u2013 in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure. I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities. At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.\nThese new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.\nAmerica must be the world's dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans \u2013 including in our inner cities \u2013 should get these new jobs.\nWe must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families \u2013 both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.\nOur debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.\nTo all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.\nWe will protect those who protect us.\nAnd we will follow their example of unity. We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.\nTogether, we will have one great American future.\nWe will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.\nAmerica will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.\nWe will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.\nWe will bring back our jobs.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we will make America great again.\n","114":"\nThank you. It's great to be back in North Carolina.\nIn 62 days, we are going to win this state \u2013 and we are going to win the White House.\nThis is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal.\nThis is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years.\nFor how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests?\nThis is the year we can finally fix it.\nThat's because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system.\nWe will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.\nWe will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems.\nSo to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over \u2013 your moment of liberation is at hand. A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy, to heal our economy, and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country.\nThe change will begin my first day in office.\nFirst, we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land.\nThen, we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border. This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs, as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth.\nBut that's just the beginning.\nI am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Under Senate rules, that bill can be passed with 51 votes \u2013 meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican President can save Americans from this disaster in a single afternoon.\nIt's going to be a very busy first day.\nI am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region. My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. She is running to be America's Angela Merkel.\nI am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so. This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will enforce it.\nThe Secretary of State is required to take this action, but Hillary Clinton refused to do so \u2013 resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S. communities.\nFurthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed \u2013 this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy.\nI will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified. We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina.\nHillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the TPP. She just does whatever her donors tell her to do.\nIn a Trump Administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers \u2013 not on behalf of global corporations.\nWe will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets \u2013 and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First.\nCrucially, I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS. Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission.\nFor years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C. The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton.\nI am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how to win \u2013 and know how to keep us out of endless war.\nToday, 88 retired U.S. generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement.\nThat's one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton. She favors what has been called military adventurism \u2013 rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families, then inviting the refugees into our country \u2013 creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS.\nI believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability \u2013 instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history.\nWe will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nWe will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton \u2013 her legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before.\nAs part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we are going to rebuild our depleted military. This is the ultimate deterrent.\nWe will be guided by those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\nI will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately re-invest in our military. Right now, we have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one of the smallest Navy's since 1917.\nLike the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security.\nWe can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential.\nThe new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office. If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn't even get a security clearance.\nHer conduct is disqualifying.\nLet's run through what we discovered in those FBI documents. It's important, and we're hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall.\nIt's clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information. She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn't understand that the letter \"C\" meant confidential in the documents she emailed.\nOn 39 separate occasions she said she couldn't recall details about her mishandling of classified information, and she couldn't even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn't get into her server. Keep in mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program.\nIt's also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions. After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery, called BleachBit.\nThey used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn't be turned over later \u2013 and by the way, who uses 12 different phones in 4 years? The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very shady activity.\nPeople who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law.\nHillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton's private attorney.\nHillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldn't recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times \u2013 and that's in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th.\nNo one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes.\nHillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors.\nIt's called pay-for-play.\nOne example of pay-for-play is what the Clinton's did in Haiti. Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country. We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake.\nBut while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have cashed in.\nBill and Hillary's brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti, and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company.\nClinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments.\nIn one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti.\nThe facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft.\nPeople are asking: where did all the money go?\nThis November, it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places.\nOne of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton's policies are African-Americans. She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future.\nMany African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country, we will honor and protect their achievements. That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent.\nBut millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools.\nThe Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.\n4 in 10 African-American children in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.\n58% of African-American youth are not working.\n2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nNationwide, African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22.\nThis is a national crisis \u2013 and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States.\nTo those suffering in crime and poverty, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change? We are going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice. I will never, ever, ever take you for granted.\nWe are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda. We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs.\nThis weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson. It was an incredible and deeply moving experience.\nI will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation \u2013 and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\nLet me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4: \"No one has ever seen God; but, if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.\"\nImagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One Flag.\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.\nIn this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans \u2013 and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.\nWe will keep our children safe \u2013 which requires secure borders, a strong military, and supporting law enforcement.\nJobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\nGovernment corruption will end \u2013 and the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton's donors.\nRepublicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless!\n","115":"\n\"Thank you. That's so nice. Thank you.\n\"Well, that's so nice. And, Bishop Jackson, I want to thank you and Dr. Jackson and you have some voice, I have to say. Incredible. And some spirit, some spirit. Talent.\n\"Thank you. Well, I just wrote this the other day knowing I'd be here. And, I mean it from the heart and I'd like to just read it and I think you'll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways.\n\"For centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country. So true. It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the Civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. It's from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character, a deeper concern for mankind, and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together. And we're bound together and I see that today. This has been an amazing day for me.\n\"The African-American faith community has been one of God's greatest gifts to America and to its people. There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the Black churches and church-goers. You do right everyday by your community and your families. You raise children in the Light of God; I will always support your church, always. And defend your right to worship . . . so important.\n\"I am here today to listen to your message and I hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought. I can tell you that.\n\"Christian faith is not the past but the present and the future. Make it stronger. And we'll open it up to great, great leaders like Pastor Jackson, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Jackson, and so many others. And so many others actually sitting here. Darrell Scott, who is phenomenal, who has been with me for so long. So long. Omrosea, who is a very nice person and I don't want to say that. Because I'll destroy her image by saying that. She's actually a very, very fine person and pastor. And I want to thank all the folks and there is somebody that's been very special to me, Dr. Ben Carson who's been . . . Stand up, Ben. Come here, come here. Come here, Ben. This is a great man and great guy.\n\"So, as I prepare to campaign all across the nation, and in every community, I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change. Which will be so good for Detroit and so good for this community because we're going to bring jobs back. I will have a chance . . . Thank you. We're bringing them back. We're taking them from Mexico and everywhere else because they're gone.\n\"I will have a chance to discuss school choice. Its very important. And how to put every American on the ladder of success. A great education, a great job. But today, I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you and I have been doing that. And we had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson. It was really an amazing interview. He is better than the people who do that professionally. I will tell you. It's true. It's true. It's true. He's better.\n\"And I didn't really know what I was getting into. I didn't know. Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild? He's a great gentleman and a very smart guy. I just hope you don't lose him to Hollywood. That's the only problem. And especially, and especially Dr. Jackson, she may be gone. Hollywood is calling. Look at all those television cameras back there. Look at all the television cameras. I'm sorry to do that to you, Bishop. Because, it's just one of those things, right?\n\"Our nation is too divided. We talk past each other, not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on. They don't know. They have no clue. I'm here today to learn. So that we can together remedy injustice, in any form. And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways.\n\"Our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself. I want to reform that system so that it works for you, everyone in this room. I believe true reform can only come from outside the system. I really mean that. Being a businessman is much different than being a politician because I understand what is happening. And we are going outside the establishment.\n\"Becoming the nominee of the Party of Abraham Lincoln \u2014 a lot of people don't realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican \u2014 has been the greatest honor of my life. It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the Party but more important the future of the country and the community.\n\"I believe that we need a Civil Rights agenda for our time. One that ensures the rights to a great education \u2014 so important \u2014 and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job. A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning. That can happen. We need to bring our companies back.\n\"It also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights, really fights for our jobs. I want to help you build and rebuild Detroit. And we can do that especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. I mean that. It's been an amazing experience. It's been an amazing experience. Really.\n\"Nothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential, tremendous potential. I met some people this morning that are incredible people and they're looking for jobs. These are incredible people . . . young people. Our whole country loses out when we're unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks\n\"We're one nation and when anyone hurts, we all hurt together. That is so true. So true.\n\"We're all brothers and sisters and we're all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together. All together.\n\"I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right. I want America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that. We can do that again.\n\"Factories everywhere, new roads and bridges, new schools \u2014 especially schools \u2014 and new hope.\n\"I have been so greatly blessed, and in so many ways, with no greater blessing than my family. I've had a great family.\n\"Nothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling all over the world \u2014 I've sort of seen a lot \u2014 to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before. And that's many, many people in Detroit.\n\"When I see wages falling, people out of work, I know the hardships this inflicts and I am determined to do something about it. I will do something about it. I do get things done, I will tell you. Some people have strengths, that's one of my strengths, I get things done. I'm going to get things done for you.\n\"Please know this, for any who are hurting, things are going to turn around.Tomorrow will be better. Much better. The Pastor and I were talking about, riding up the street, how we see all those closed stores and people sitting down on the sidewalk, and no jobs, and no activity. We'll get it turned around. We'll get it turned around, Pastor. Believe me.\n\"We're going to win again as a country and we're going to win again for all of our people. I want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong. America has been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. So important. People have no idea how important they are.\n\"Now, in these hard times for our country, let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. I am so deeply grateful to be here today and it is my prayer that the America of tomorrow \u2014 and I mean that \u2014 that the America oftomorrow will be one of unity, togetherness, and peace. And perhaps we can add the word prosperity. Ok? Prosperity.\n\"I'd like to conclude with a passage from 1 John, Chapter 4. You know it? See, most groups I speak to don't know that. But we know it. If you want, we can say it together: 'No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and His love is made complete in us.' And that is so true.\n\"Thank you very much. This has been such an honor. Thank you very much. Bishop, thank you sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\"\n","116":"\nThank you all so much. What an honor and a privilege to speak today to the American Legion.\nI thank Commander Dale Barnett, your vice commanders, and your constitutional officers. You have all done such an incredible job.\nThe men and women of the American Legion represent the best of America. Strength, courage, selfless devotion. Your organization, and its members, have done so much to defend our country, our flag, and to advance the cause of Americanism \u2013 not Globalism.\nWe are in your debt.\nI will never let you down.\nTogether, we are going to work on so many shared goals. But I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you: promoting American pride and patriotism in America's schools.\nIn A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America's children. We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America's history, its institutions, and its heroes.\nWe will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.\nWe will be united by our common culture, values and principles \u2013 becoming One American Nation.\nOne country, under one constitution, saluting one American Flag.\nThe flag all of you helped to protect and preserve.\nThat flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag \u2013 and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.\nIn addition to teaching respect for the flag, we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries.\nWe will rebuild our depleted military, and pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense. We will do it based on those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\nWe will make sure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have the best equipment, training and tools in the world \u2013 and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world, both in service, and when they return home as civilians.\nThat will require a total reform of the Veterans Administration.\nI've laid out a ten-step VA reform plan you can review on my website. Here are the basics:\nI will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the VA.\nThe Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our veterans \u2013 not bureaucrats, not politicians, but veterans.\nI am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline anyone who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust.\nI will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system.\nWe are going to ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care, including the best care in the world for our female veterans.\nThe Veterans health system will remain a public system, because it is a public trust. But never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care.\nThat means Veterans will have the right to go to a VA facility, or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice \u2013 whatever is fastest and best for the veteran. The Veteran will be in control.\nShould I have the honor of serving as president, we are also going to start facing the world with confidence again. We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security \u2013 and our border.\nI just came back from a great meeting with the President of Mexico, where I expressed my deep respect for the people of his country, and for the tremendous contributions of Mexican-Americans in our country \u2013 including to our Armed Services.\nI want to again thank him for his gracious hospitality, and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both of our countries.\nWe agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.\nWe also talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere. A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings, and a better market for products made in the United States.\nWhen I am President, I am going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect American jobs and create new opportunities for American workers. We will fight for every last American job.\nWe're going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing American economy looks like.\nWe are going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores \u2013 and unleash an American Energy Revolution.\nWe will also be appointing justices who will defend our Constitution.\nI will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of Antonin Scalia, judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and not just make it up.\nAbove all, these next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the United States and our friends and allies. We are going to end the era of nation-building, and create a new foreign policy \u2013 joined by our partners in the Middle East \u2013 that is focused on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic Terrorism. We will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.\nAt the same time, we will change our immigration screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country. That includes stopping the influx of Syrian refugees. My opponent wants a 550% increase. I, on the other hand, want to build a safe zone overseas \u2013 and use the money saved to invest in America.\nIt is time to create a New American Future \u2013 for you, your children, and all American children yet to come.\nIn this future, we will have an honest government \u2013 and that includes an honest State Department, not Pay-For-Play. Government access and favors will no longer be for sale, and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally bleached.\nWe will also have an efficient and responsible federal budget \u2013 no more waste, no more throwing away taxpayer dollars.\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nIt will be an inclusive society, one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country \u2013 including our inner cities. We will ensure that every child in this land, including African-American and Hispanic child, is put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a great job.\nWe will follow the noble example of our military men and women, working selflessly across all difference races and incomes and backgrounds, to achieve unity and accomplish amazing things.\nLadies and gentlemen of the American Legion, I ask today for the honor of your vote. Working in unison, we can deliver the real American change our country so desperately needs.\nWe will make America Strong Again.\nWe will Make America Proud Again.\nWe will Make America Safe Again.\nWe will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God bless.\n","117":"\nIt's so great to be back in Ohio.\nCome November, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House \u2013 and we are going to bring back your jobs.\nWe are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.\nWe are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation. We are going to stop the foreign cheating.\nThe era of economic surrender is over.\nA new era of American Greatness is beginning.\nNo state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.\nHillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, she backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nOne bad deal after another.\nHillary Clinton's donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.\nOhio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.\nOur trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. This subtracts directly from our growth \u2013 our economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.\nI am promising a new legacy for America.\nWe are going to create a New American Future.\nBut to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nOur trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.\nHillary Clinton, who called the TPP the \"Gold Standard\", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.\nWe won't let that happen.\nWe will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.\nWe will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.\nIt's going to be America First.\nMy economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.\nHere are a few of the things we will do:\nA massive tax cut for working Americans.\nWe are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration's new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.\nHillary Clinton says she wants to \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\" Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.\nWe are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work \u2013 and we are going to get your energy bills down.\nWe are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.\nWe are going to create jobs for all of our people, and we are going to fight to ensure that every young African-American and Latino child is put on the ladder of American success: a good education, and a great job.\nAnother major part of our agenda is immigration security. We need to protect American jobs. We need to protect American safety.\nLast night, I outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs, safety and security to the American people with bold new immigration reforms.\nI had a great meeting yesterday with the President of Mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border, put the cartels out of business, and to keep jobs in our hemisphere.\nLet's also talk about government corruption.\nNo issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.\nHere is one example of Clinton Corruption.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians. Clinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.\nHere is another example of pay-for-play.\nIn 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments \u2013 including Sudan, Syria, and Iran. Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.\nIn June 2011, Hillary Clinton's state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.\nDuring that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 \u2013 his highest paying speech.\nIn April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria \u2013but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran.\nA Trump Administration will end the government corruption.\nNo one will be above the law.\nWe will have one set of rules for everyone. In Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her \u2013 and another set of rules for everyone else.\nI am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. The forgotten men and women of America.\nI am your voice.\nHillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.\nNothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.\nCome November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.\nWe are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\nWe are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.\nWe are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values.\nMy tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.\nMy energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill.\nMy trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.\nMy immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers.\nMy infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.\nMy regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.\nMy promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities. Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.\nMy government reforms will make your voice heard \u2013 not the voice of the special interests.\nEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nInsiders fighting for insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nEvery day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.\nI wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting \u2013 all of us across the country are fighting \u2013 for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\nI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity \u2013 a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.\nTo every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make American Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless.\n","118":"\nWow. Thank you. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people.\nThank you very much.\nThank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.\nThe state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.\nNow, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, OK?\nThis will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\nI've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\nAnd, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\nWe agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.\nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.\nThis is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly.\nSadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.\nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.\nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\nThank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\nThese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\nThen there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.\nThis includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.\nHe was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant.\nHe was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.\nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.\nAnd this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.\nAnd they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\nBut these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.\nNot going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.\nThe truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million.\nOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.\nFrankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.\nBut whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\nOnly the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.\nTo all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.\nNothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.\nNo, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.\nWe will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\nThank you.\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. they support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\nOn top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.\nMost incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan Horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.\nThis includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\nHard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan.And do you notice --\nAnd do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.\nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.\nI also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\nNumber one, are you ready? Are you ready?\nWe will build a great wall along the southern border.\nAnd Mexico will pay for the wall.\nOne hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall. On day one, we will begin working on intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.\nWe will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.\nAbove and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.\nNumber two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.\nUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\nAnd they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.\nThen when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?\nNumber three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.\nZero. They don't come in here. They don't come in here.\nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.\nNow, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.\nThey live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.\nAnd you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.\nBeyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.\nThey're going out. They're going out fast.\nMoving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.\nWe will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.\nThat's over. That's over, folks. That's over.\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.\nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.\nBoth of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.\nThis is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.\nHere's an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration -- tough enforcement, no amnesty, deportations -- and its affect on their own opinions.\nOn my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.\nTo ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.\nAnd then we get them out.\nAnother reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.\nThe Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.\nWe're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.\nWithin ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?\nMaybe they'll be able to deport her.\nThe local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\nWe're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.\nWho gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.\nAnd put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.\nI've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.\nAnd getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\nNumber four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.\nWe will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\nNumber five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\nWe will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.\nAnd how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.\nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great.\nClinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.\nAnd don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\nAnd don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.\nClinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\nCan you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.\nAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.\nNumber six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\nAccording to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9\/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.\nOur country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.\nThe number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.\nHomeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.\nI call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.\nAnd if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria.We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.\nFor the price of resettling, one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.\nBut we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We'll supervise it. We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.\nAnother reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\nThank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.\nThat's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our President refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.\nNumber seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.\nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, OK, we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.\nDue to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.\nAnd by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.\nSecretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.\nIn other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.\nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.\nAccording to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.\nWe're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\nThese 13,000 release occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.\nAnd, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\nThe Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.\nNumber eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately. For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.\nHillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.\nApproximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should the? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.\nBeyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9\/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9\/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.\nAnd, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant?\nLast year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\nIf people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.\nWe must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\nNumber nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\nImmigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.\nThat is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.\nAnd the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.\nTremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\nNumber 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.\nAnd by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.\nWe have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.\nWe're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.\nWe've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.\nWe've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.\nWithin just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.\nTo keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.\nWe take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.\nYou know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first. Remember that.\nTo choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.\nAnd Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November eighth. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.\nShe is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.\nYou watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.\nTo avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\nSo let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.\nI will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.\nAnd the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.\nFor those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --\nThank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.\nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.\nOur message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.\nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.\nImportantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.\nAnd the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\nThat discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\nRight now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.\nWhether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\nThese are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And do you notice, she doesn't answer.\nShe didn't go to Louisiana. She didn't go to Mexico. She was invited.\nShe doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.\nWhat we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing.\nThe result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.\nThis election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.\nIt's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that.\nSo I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.\nI am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I'm going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women.\nThese are amazing people.\n(Family members speak individually.)\nThank you.\nThese are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it. Let's give them a really tremendous hand.\nThat's tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.\nSo, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.\nLet's fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's our secure our border.\nLet's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let's protect our social security and Medicare. Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.\nThis has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.\nWe're going to bring -- thank you, thank you. We're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThis is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.\nTogether we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.\nThank you. I love you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. God bless you, thank you.\n","119":"\nThank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Washington.\nTogether, we are going to work hard over the next 70 days and we are going to win this state \u2013 and we are going to win the White House.\nIt's going to be a victory for the people. A victory for the everyday citizen whose voice hasn't been heard.\nIt will be a win for the voters \u2013 not the pundits, not the journalists, not the lobbyists, not the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign.\nThis is going to be YOUR victory.\nWe are going to create the New American Future our children deserve.\nIn this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the workforce.\nCrumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves.\nFamilies trapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity.\nGovernment will become lean, effective, responsible \u2013 and honest.\nOur border will be protected, and our children will be safe.\nWe will rebuild our inner cities, and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens.\nAmerican values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again.\nBut to achieve this future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past \u2013 and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies.\nOne area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for African-American citizens in the United States.\nMillions of African-Americans in this country have succeeded greatly, and their contributions to every area of our life \u2013 now and throughout our history \u2013 should be celebrated and cherished. This includes the amazing achievements in art, science, sport, music, medicine, business and so much else. This includes millions of African-American entrepreneurs, innovators and the millions of African-American workers in our middle class.\nBut we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities \u2013 and neighborhoods afflicted by poverty, drugs, and violence.\nNo group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans.\nThere is no better evidence of this fact than Hillary Clinton's immigration policy, which brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from hardworking African-American and Hispanic citizens.\nInstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs to struggling Americans.\nTonight, I am asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants a better future.\nThe inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for fifty, sixty, seventy years.\nThese Democratic policies \u2013 the policies of Hillary Clinton \u2013 have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, broken homes, and rising crime.\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009.\nIn Detroit, half of all its residents do not work. In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the ages of 24-54 do not have a job.\nHere, in the state of Washington, 65% of Latino children and 60% of African-American children live in low-income households.\nChicago just had the most violent month in 20 years. More than 2,800 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nIt breaks our hearts.\nWe cannot let this violence continue. It must be ended.\nUnder A Trump Administration, it will be ended.\nIt will be my priority to work with communities, local police, state police and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear. I will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission.\nThere is one thing which can no longer be denied: if you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results. To those suffering, I say: what do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump? I will fix it. I will fight for you as no one ever has before.\nLet me also tell you what you have to gain: jobs, opportunity, security, and safety.\nThis means so much to me.\nI believe every child in this country \u2013 in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Chicago \u2013 has the right to live out their lives in safety and peace.\nIn the Wall Street Journal, Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime in our inner cities, and the responsibility of Democratic politicians for creating this problem.\nThe article is called: \"Black Lives Matter to Donald Trump.\" McDonald writes that \"Mr. Trump's call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now takes for granted.\"\nFreedom from violence is one of the great civil rights issues of our time. So too is the issue of school choice.\nWe will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success.\nI will not accept a future in which children of any color in this country are not fully included in the American Dream. Our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented, aspiring Americans on the sidelines. We want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and our country.\nRemember: the Republican Party is the Party of Lincoln, the party of freedom, equality and opportunity. It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow, the party of oppression.\nNothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party.\nOur party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country.\nOnce again, we will be One American Nation.\nOne United People.\nAnd we will have One Great Future.\nThat great future will be built on these three critical words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nThis will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector, which has been so badly hurt by Hillary Clinton's policies.\nWe are bringing the jobs back to our country.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA, keep out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stand up to China, and fight for every last American job.\nThe destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved.\nThat would be a disaster. We won't let it happen.\nBut that's just the beginning of what we are going to do for American workers.\nOn taxes, we are going to provide massive tax relief to all working people, and lower the tax rate on small business from 35% down to 15%. Low and middle-income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes.\nOn regulations, I am going to direct every agency and Department Head in my government to identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will be removed. We will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow and thrive.\nEconomic growth for last quarter has been revised down to 1.1%, a total disaster. Meanwhile, our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.\nWe will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an American energy revolution \u2013 lifting restrictions on oil, coal, natural gas and all sources of American energy. This will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy for all families.\nWe are also going to secure our border to stop the drugs from pouring in. The Seattle-area recently experienced the largest number of heroin-related deaths in 20 years. We have to stop the drugs poisoning our communities.\nAnother major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another \u2013 beginning with her support for going to war in Iraq in the first place, which I opposed.\nHer tenure as Secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in U.S. history.\nLook at the world before and after she became Secretary of State.\nPre-Hillary, in early 2009, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\nLibya was stable.\nSyria was under control.\nThe group we know today as ISIS was close to being extinguished.\nIran was being choked by sanctions.\nNow, fast-forward to present time.\nAfter Hillary, here is what the world looks like:\nIraq is in total chaos.\nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.\nISIS has been unleashed onto the entire world.\nIran \u2013 the world's top state sponsor of terrorism \u2013 has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, and was given a $400 million dollar cash ransom payment.\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and terrorism.\nAmerica deserves a better legacy.\nAll of you deserve a better future. I am the change agent.\nHillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo.\nWhile our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time. Bill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State \u2013 Bill was paid almost $50 million dollars for speeches during her tenure, an increase of 44% over the previous 4 years.\nThen there was all the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations.\nIt was pay-for-play. Just look at what she did with UBS, or the Russian Uranium, or disaster relief in Haiti, and so many other examples.\nBut the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 emails she deleted.\nHillary Clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her work-related emails. But we know that is one more Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she never turned over, and then another 15,000 emails were just discovered a few weeks ago.\nNow, today, another 30 emails were discovered by the State Department that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over \u2013 these were emails about Benghazi.\nIt just never ends with the Clintons.\nThere is only one way to get justice in this rigged system and that is to show up and vote on November 8th \u2013 and to vote big.\nIn A Trump Administration, the State Department will work for the country \u2013 not for Hillary Clinton's donors.\nUnder Hillary Clinton, it's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nPoliticians defending politicians.\nInsiders fighting for insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nThe government will work for citizens once again.\nThe era of division will be replaced with a future of unity.\nWe are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common. We will proudly promote our culture as Americans, the best in the world.\nIt is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve.\nThis is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a thriving economy, and a just society for each and every American.\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.\nTogether, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless.\n","120":"\nThank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]\nSenator, Governor and Rudy, thank you very much.\nWow, what a group! What a group!\nVery excited, very, very excited to be with you tonight. Thank you very much. [applause]\nThe people of Jackson and the state of Mississippi have such incredible energy, that very powerful word \"energy,\" unbelievable, incredible energy and spirit, folks. Thank you very much.\nAnd thank you for all the support you've given me right from the beginning. I will not forget it, Mississippi. We love Mississippi right from the beginning, right from the beginning. [applause]\nThis is the spirit we need to rebuild our country a hundred percent. [applause]\nAnd this is our chance to break free from the bitter failures of the past and to create a new American future. [applause]\nTo everyone watching across our nation right now, to everyone who has been let down by our terrible, terrible politicians, I am asking for your vote on November 8th. [applause]\nThis is your chance to remove the special interests from their throne of power and to once again have a government of, by and for the people. [applause]\nNo one will be left behind anymore. [applause]\nI'd like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone at the American University in Kabul, Afghanistan. They are going through a lot.\nWe must defeat radical Islamic terrorism! [applause]\nAnyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [applause]\nEight years of Obama\/Clinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence. Our jobs have moved to other countries. Islamic terrorism has spread within our shores. And an open border has crushed low-income workers and threatened, and I mean totally threatened, our security. [applause]\nThe issues we face here in America are similar to the issues faced in Britain during their referendum on membership in the European Union. This is the movement known as Brexit.\nOn June 23rd, the people of Britain voted to declare their independence, which is what we're looking to do also, folks [applause]\nFrom their international government which hasn't worked. They voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders. [booing]\nThey voted to reclaim control over immigration, over their economy, over their government. [booing]\nWorking people and the great people of the U.K. took control of their destiny. [applause]\nThe people profiting from the rigged system, and it is rigged, we're finding it out every single day, the multinational banks, the media celebrities, the big donors tried to scare the British people out of voting for change. The same thing is happening right here in the United States. It's happening.\nAll the people benefiting from our rigged system don't want things to change. They want you to believe things can't be changed.\nAnd they can so easily, so easily and so smartly.\nAnd we all know things have to change. We have no choice. And they have to change right now. [applause]\nBefore the vote, I said that Britain would leave the EU, sometimes referred to as European Union, and I said it and I took a lot of heat when I said it. People said, what does he know, what does he know? And guess what? I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future, like exactly what we're going to be voting for on November 8th. [applause]\nHillary Clinton, who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision, she's only made bad decisions, she's got bad judgment, she doesn't know what she's doing, folks. [booing]\nShe got this one wrong, too.\nShe got this one wrong, too, folks. She got this one wrong, too. She gets them all wrong. She gets them all wrong, doesn't she? She really got the e-mails wrong, that I can tell you. [laughter]\nAnd now Hillary wants to surrender America to globalism, just what we don't want. [booing]\nShe wants a country without borders. She wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations. She wants a government that ignores the will of the people. [booing]\nShe wants to sell out American security to the Clinton Foundation for a big, fat pile of cash. [booing]\nIt's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins.\nAccording to the Associated Press, more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors. [booing]\nHillary Clinton does not believe in America first. We believe in America first. [applause]\nHillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists. She will never straighten out our country. She doesn't have the strength, the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country. We'll have four more years of Obama and that's just what we don't want. [booing]\nShe would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed American veteran or to an unemployed African American or Hispanic. [booing]\nThe job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the United States [applause]\nNot illegal immigrants, not foreign nationals seeking entry, but the people living here lawfully today, including millions of African-American and Hispanic citizens, millions, millions being treated very, very unfairly, I can tell you that.\nMy focus will always be on the well-being of more than 300 million American citizens who call this country home and who love their country. [applause]\nI will fight for their security. I will fight for their jobs. We will not let jobs be taken out of our country, be ripped out of our country and moved to Mexico and many other countries. We will not let it happen anymore. [applause]\nWe'll be fighting for their jobs and we'll be fighting for your families, that I can tell you. It ends. What's been going on ends on November 8th. [applause]\nWe will have one American nation, not divided, we will be together. Hillary Clinton has betrayed her duty to the people. November 8th is our chance to re-declare American independence. [applause]\nThis is a great honor for me. I am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind Brexit and a man who led brilliantly the United Kingdom Independence Party in this fight and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.\nLadies and gentlemen, Mr. Nigel Farage. [applause]\nNigel Farage: \"Well, Thank you very much\nGood evening Mississippi. [applause]\nI come to you from the United Kingdom with a message of hope and a message of optimism. It's a message that says if the little people, if the real people, if the ordinary decent people are prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in we can overcome the big banks, we can overcome the multinationals. [applause]\nAnd we did it. We made June the 23rd our independence day. [applause]\nWhen we smashed the establishment. And we did it. Everybody said we would lose but what did we see? We saw experts from all over the world. We saw the international monetary fund. We saw Moody's. We saw Standard and Poor's. We saw global leaders project fear.\nTelling us that if we voted not to be run by a bunch of unelected old men in Brussels. [applause]\nYeah, well it's okay, they don't like me either so it doesn't really matter does it? [applause]\nBut they told us our economy would fall off of a cliff. They told us there'd be mass unemployment. They told us that investment would leave our country. And David Cameron, then our Prime Minister, but no longer, told us that we might even get World War III.\nAnd we saw the comentariate and we saw the polling industry doing everything they could to demoralize our campaign. On the day of the vote itself, that morning, they put us ten points behind. And actually, they were all wrong. And they were wrong because what the Brexit campaign did is we reached those people who've been let down by modern global corporatism.\nWe reached those people. We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believe by going out and voting for Brexit they can take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self respect. Now, the big card, the big card the Prime Minister decided to play in the referendum was he got a foreign visitor to come to London. to talk to us.\nYes, we were visited by one Barack Obama. And he talked down to us. He treated us as if we were nothing. One of the oldest functioning democracies in the world. And here he was told us to vote remain.\nSo I, having criticized, having criticized and condemned his behavior, I could not possibly tell you how you should vote in this election, but, but, you know I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I'm hearing you, but I will say this, if I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me.\nIn fact, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me.\nFolks, the message is clear. The parallels are there.\nThere are millions of ordinary Americans who have been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.\nThey feel people aren't standing up for them and they've actually, in many cases, given up on the whole electoral process. And I think, I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.\nYou can go out, you can beat the pollsters, you can beat the commentators, you can beat Washington. And you'll do it by doing what we did for Brexit in Britain.\nWe had our own people's army of ordinary citizens who went out and delivered leaflets, who went to meet people where they worked and where they socialized, who convinced and inspired people to go out if this was the one and only time in their life, and to vote for change.\nSo my advice to you, if you want change in this country, you better get your walking boots on, you better get out there campaigning and remember, and remember, anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment.\nThank you very much, indeed.\"\nWow! Thank you, Nigel.\nWhat a job! What a job he did. What a job he did against all odds.\nThank you, Nigel.\nThat was some job that he did against all odds. Everybody said it couldn't be done. And by the way, it's looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters, so I really congratulate Nigel and I thank you for being here. Thank you. [applause]\nAnd if I may, we had some tremendous polls come out today. I won't bring it up, I refuse to mention it, but they were very good. We're leading in a lot of locations. [applause]\nThank you.\nIt's time for America to recapture, like you just heard, to recapture our destiny. Our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people. They have, they have totally lost touch.\nYou need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants, but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law. We can't allow that. [booing]\nWhy do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally, they're here illegally, and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them, but they don't try helping American citizens, some of whom have been devastated by what's happened to their children and their families? Devastated.\njobs, wages and security for Americans. [applause]\nAnd the immigration policy I support as president must pass these three tests. First, it must improve jobs and wages for United States citizens. [applause]\nWe have people in this room who were making more money in real wages 18 years ago, were not working as hard as they're working now and they've gotten older, not supposed to be that way, and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as \"Obamacare\" they have to hold two jobs, not one, but two jobs and, in some cases, three jobs.\nNot going to happen, folks, not going to happen.\nSecond, it must improve the safety and security for United States citizens. [applause]\nThird, it must improve the quality of life for U.S. citizens. The quality of life, our quality of life is going down.\nOur level of security, you look back years, you're more insecure now in terms of security than you were 10, 15 and 20 years ago.\nHillary Clinton's radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very, very badly. Her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful American residents. [booing]\nHer support for catch-and-release will put innocent American lives at risk and already has, just like President Obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent, magnificent Sarah Root.\nYesterday I met with her mom, Michelle. Hillary Clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally. I want to focus on the American families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that Hillary Clinton so strongly supports. [booing]\nWhere is the sanctuary for American children? Where is that sanctuary? The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why aren't young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be young Americans. [applause]\nHillary Clinton also wants to push to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term [booing]\nA large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized, which will weaken our tolerant way of life.\nI only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving America. [applause]\nImportantly, I will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people. [applause]\nWe are going to cut taxes, reduce regulations, fix our trade deals, unleash American energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as \"Obamacare.\" [applause]\nWe are going to create jobs, jobs, jobs! [applause]\nI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, believe me. [applause]\nSo we're going to have millions and millions of jobs, jobs like you have never seen in this country before, because our jobs are being stolen from us, our companies are being stolen from us, our manufacturing is down by 40 percent and 50 percent and numbers that nobody even believes. Those days will be over if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, believe me. [applause]\nRising incomes, higher wages, thousands of new companies all across this nation, they'll come in and they'll form. We are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made, not only in this country, but anywhere in the world, known as NAFTA and signed by Bill Clinton. [booing]\nWe're going to stand up to China on trade. We're going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. [booing]\nIt will not happen with me. It will absolutely happen with crooked Hillary, believe me.\nThis state has lost more than 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and it's lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put China into the World Trade Organization, both deals supported by Hillary Clinton. Horrible deals, destructive deals, what those deals have done to our jobs and to our country.\nWe are going to bring back jobs to Mississippi [applause]\nAnd in North Carolina, which has treated me so well, and Ohio and to Michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to Mexico and other places, and to Pennsylvania, where I went to school, and to Maryland and all across this land. We're going to bring our jobs back and we're not going to let our jobs be taken away. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you.\nAnd I'm going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity, safety and prosperity to our very, very troubled inner cities. [applause]\nThe Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. [booing]\nDemocratic crime policies, education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes and more poverty than we've ever had in those communities before. [booing]\nNearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of this year alone. [booing]\nViolent crime has risen 17 percent, and in America's 50 largest cities it's only going one way, folks, and that's up. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent from last year in Baltimore.\nThe Democratic Party has taken the votes of African Americans totally for granted, and they've done nothing in return. [booing]\nThey've just assumed they'll get your support and they've done nothing, absolutely nothing to deserve it.\nIt's time to give the Democrats some competition for African- American votes and for Hispanic votes. [applause]\nIt's time to rebuild the inner cities of America and do it properly. It's time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system. And I was the first to use that term, it's a rigged, disgusting system. [applause]\nTo those hurting and suffering and left behind, I say, what do you have to lose by trying something new? What do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump for president? What do you have to lose? I will fix the problem. I will fix the problem. [applause]\nIf you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same horrible results.\nBut I also want to talk about what you have to gain, right? Right? What do you have to gain? We will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive. [applause]\nWhat else will we gain? We will empower young Americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need. [applause]\nWe will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity. And the African-American community and the Hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that. [applause]\nWe will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before. [applause]\nWe will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs. And we will rebuild the roads, the bridges, the infrastructure, the tunnels, the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies, with our steel and with our labor. [applause]\nHillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color [applause]\nonly as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. She's going to do nothing for African Americans. She's going to do nothing for the Hispanics. She's only going to take care of herself, her husband, her consultants, her donors. These are the people she cares about. She doesn't care what her policies have done to your communities. She doesn't care.\nRemember this. You've had her policies, Democrats running some of the inner cities for 50, 70, 80, even over a hundred years. And look what you have right now, poverty, no education, crime, you can't walk down the street with your child. We're going to fix it, we're going to fix it. [applause]\nHillary Clinton has no remorse. I will fight to create a better future for every American. The hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors are throwing money at Hillary Clinton to try and stop our change agenda.\nOf course, if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that. [applause]\nThey're going to have to start studying those polls. That's why you need to come out and you have to vote, you have to vote. [applause]\nThat is why you must make your voice heard on November 8th, have to do it. [applause]\nAnother crucial issue in this race is national security. Hillary Clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office. [booing]\nLet's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama\/Clinton administration, that I call a catastrophe, took over. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, would never have happened. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.\nFast forward to today. After spending $4 trillion, maybe $5 trillion, nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country, what have the decisions of Obama\/Clinton produced?\nLibya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations, they're all over the world\nSyria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of the territory.\nA refugee crisis now threatens Europe and is threatening the United States because Hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country and we don't know who they are, where they come from. We know nothing.\nIraq is in chaos and ISIS is on the loose.\nISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the west. At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and definitely folks, definitely, I have been very good at predicting, definitely to the United States. [booing]\nIran has become the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with up to $150 billion in cash released by the United States, plus another $400 million in cash, cash, cash ransom [booing]\nThat President Obama said had nothing to do with ransom, had nothing to do with the hostages, and his own people said he was wrong. [booing]\nHe lied. He lied. Just like he said Obamacare, \"keep your plan, you'll keep your doctor,\" 28 times, \"keep your plan, keep your doctor.\" And because of that lie, Democrats that would have never passed it passed it and now they regret that they passed it because it is a total disaster. [booing]\nWorst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number-one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama\/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran, which chants, constantly chants \"death to America\" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power. And we put them there over the last three years! [booing]\nThis is the legacy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness. [booing]\nBut Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. We're going to end the era of nation-building, a disastrous concept, a disastrous era, and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused completely on destroying ISIS. We have no choice destroying ISIS. [applause]\nWe will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.\nI have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people, our citizens, trying to hurt the world, but trying to hurt the United States: We will find you, we will destroy you and we will win! [applause]\nThank you. Thank you.\nThis is not only a military fight, but it will also require cyber warfare and financial warfare. It's also an ideological fight. We will confront directly the hateful, it's just so hateful, ideology of radical Islam and promote American values and American culture and America's system of government.\nOnly by standing up for and supporting, we have to stand up for and support, our values can we become a united country once again [applause]\nA country of great jobs and wealth, a country of security and freedom, a country of strength and unity. The future is limitless. All we have to do is believe in America once again. We have to believe it can happen. It can happen. [applause]\nWe will put back our faith in America's special destiny. We will lift the burdens on small business which is being driven into extinction by what's happening in our government. We'll create a level playing field for American workers. We'll never ever let what's happened to them happen to them again. We'll establish justice and opportunity and safety in every community in the land.\nI am asking for the vote of every citizen in this country, African American, Hispanic, all Americans, all Americans who want a better, brighter and stronger future for yourselves and for our country. [applause]\nI am the change candidate. This is our moment to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. [applause]\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. I will be your champion and I will work hard to be your champion.\nAnd I won't be playing golf instead of going to see the people in Louisiana who have been devastated by floods. [applause]\nI'm going to be the champion to every parent who dreams for their children. And to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am with you, I will fight for you, and we will win for you, we will win. [applause]\nTogether we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, we will make America great again.\nThank you and God bless you. Thank you, Mississippi. We love Mississippi. God bless you. Thank you. [applause]\n","121":"\nOn November 8th, we are going to declare our independence from special interests, corrupt politicians, and from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders.\nWe are going to declare our independence from media executives that don't care about us, and politicians who don't listen to us.\nWe are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty and crushing debt.\nWe are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.\nOnce again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo.\nIt's going to be America First from now on.\nLet me tell you what this new future looks like.\nWe are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs.\nWe are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWe are going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.\nWe are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment.\nWe will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility, or with the private doctor of their choice.\nWe're going to eliminate job-killing regulations.\nWe are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.\nLet's talk about another issue that is important to our future, and the future of our children.\nThat's the issue of crime. Violent crime is rising across the country. More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year.\nNo American should consider this level of crime acceptable. Every American has the right to live in safety and peace.\nA Trump Administration is going to restore law and order.\nLet me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers. This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers, and the wounding of another 7, in the assault on Dallas. We pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded.\nTo all law enforcement in America: we are with you, we support you, and we will always stand with you.\nTogether, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land \u2013 but especially those who have not known safety in a very, very long time.\nThat includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law.\nI will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people.\nI will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear.\nAll citizens deserve to be protected. No American left behind.\nI want every African-American parent in this country \u2013 and all parents in this country \u2013 to be able to raise their kids in safety.\nAnd I want to ensure every African-American child in this country \u2013 and all children in this country \u2013 are put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.\nWe are going to have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers. My opponent, Hillary Clinton, discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy.\nNo one owns me. I answer only to the American people.\nIn a New York Post column, Deroy Murdock, published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities. Murdock confirms these facts:\n\"The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent \u2014 down 3.2 percent.\nThis metric also slumped for black teenagers, from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent \u2014 down 6.4 percent.\nThe percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014 \u2014 up 1.6 percent.\nThe number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama \u2014 from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014 \u2014 up 58.2 percent.\nAlso, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent, the Census reports \u2014 down 9.5 percent.\"\nNearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty. 58 percent of young African Americans are not employed.\nHomicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore. Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities.\nThis is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nTo those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?\nLet me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs, higher wages, and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities.\nWe are going to turn it all around. Success must be created for everyone, and available to everyone.\nThat is how we are going to create a New American Future.\nBut to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all: Border Security.\nWe are going to build a wall.\nWe are going to enforce the law.\nWe are going to protect your jobs and wages.\nAnd we are going to keep our country safe.\nAccording to the Texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft.\nYet, Hillary Clinton wants a totally, completely open border.\nShe wants catch-and-release.\nObamacare for illegal immigrants.\nMassive amnesty in her first 100 days.\nShe wants to gut immigration enforcement.\nShe supports Sanctuary Cities.\nShe wants to let people overstay their visas without removal.\nOne lawless order after another.\nWe must not let it happen.\nHillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9\/11, and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider.\nI want to create safe zones in the Middle East. My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening, and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values. After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about.\nThis election will decide whether or not we have a border.\nThis election will decide whether or not we have a country.\nToday I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports. Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories.\nThese are all forgotten Americans \u2013 they are not Hollywood or media stars, or big money special interest donors.\nShe is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests.\nThis corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy. Every day more and more alarming facts come out.\nThe scandal I speak of is the State Department's Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton.\nIf our Secretary of State can be bought, or bribed, or sell or trade government favors, then the whole American system is threatened.\nIt is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself. This is what happens in a Third World country \u2013 it's the failed conditions people flee when they come to America.\nAmerica can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash.\nThe new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.\nHillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes. That's why she deleted 33,000 emails. That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public.\nShe said she never sent or received classified materials.\nThat was a lie, proved over and over again.\nShe claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device. But she used multiple devices.\nAnother lie.\nUnder penalty of perjury, she said she turned over all of her work-related emails. But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another 15,000 more.\nAnother Clinton lie.\nShe said she sent nothing marked classified.\nA total lie, unmasked to the world. And more to come.\nShe said her server was secure, and had no breaches. But we know now it was completely unsecure, and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies.\nMore Clinton lies.\nClinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them.\nOne more Hillary Clinton lie.\nLie after lie after lie.\nHillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office.\nIt is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons' set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.\nIt goes back to the Arkansas days, and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors.\nBut once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business \u2013 or, more accurately, their crime enterprise \u2013 grew with the roles reversed. Bill, now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator, Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President. They turned this into an exponentially larger business.\nBut it was more than a business, it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise. It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States.\nThe e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same. If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton, you got an entry to the Department of State. Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.\nToday a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills. She was Secretary of State Clinton's Chief of Staff. You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business. But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation \u2013 no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages.\nWe also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation.\nThis creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.\nThe specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech. I walked through two of them yesterday \u2013 the sale of U.S. Uranium to Russia, and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech.\nThe UBS saga is another one. Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans.\nShe negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement. Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450 accounts. Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual.\nBefore her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60,000 to the Foundation. After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton.\nThis is corruption, pure and simple.\nThis is why I have called for a special prosecutor.\nJustice is supposed to be blind. It's never supposed to be for sale.\nIn the long-run, there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J. Trump.\nHillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.\nYou will be voting for justice, fairness and equality.\nYou will also be voting for a more inclusive country, where no one is left out.\nAnother 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama. The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.\nOur pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation. I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty.\nWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.\nThe era of division is coming to end. We will create a new future of American unity.\nAre you ready for real American change?\nIt is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans.\nWe will promote our common culture, values and principles.\nWe will be one nation.\nWe will be one people.\nWe will share together one great future.\nIt's going to be America First.\nTogether, we will make America proud again.\nWe will make America prosperous again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nFriends, citizens and fellow Americans: We will make America great again.\n","122":"\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. What a crowd. Wow, look at that. Boy. What a crowd. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. We just set a record in this building, folks, so that's good news. That's fantastic. Thank you. [applause]\nI love Michigan, and I must tell you, come November, to be specific, November 8th, with your help, we are going to win and we are going to win big. [applause]\nAnd we are going to the White House and we are going to bring jobs back to our country and we are going to bring jobs back to Michigan. [applause]\nIt's going to be a victory for the people, a victory for the wage-earner, the factory worker. Remember this, a big, big victory for the factory worker. They haven't had those victories for a long time. A victory for every citizen and for all of the people whose voices have not been heard for many, many years. They're going to be heard again. [applause]\nIt'll be a win for the voters, not for the pundits, not for the journalists, not for the lobbyists, not for the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign. [booing]\nIt's going to be your victory. [applause]\nThese are hard times for many in this country. I just got back from a tour of the suffering and devastation in Louisiana. Perhaps you can tell by the way I'm dressed. Just got off the plane. It was actually incredible. The spirit of the people is incredible. The devastation, likewise, they've never seen anything like it, but the spirit of the people is incredible. And honestly, Obama ought to get off the golf course and get down there. [applause]\nWe mourn for the lives lost and we pledge our help, comfort and support to every last person in need. To the people of Louisiana, we are with you and we will always be with you. [applause]\nIn my vision, I saw not only the suffering of our people but also their strength, courage and really unbeatable spirit. Their spirit will overcome. We have a lot to overcome in our country, especially the fact that our jobs are being taken away from us and going to other lands, and we're not going to allow it to happen, and especially it's happening right here in Michigan. [applause]\nIt's an amazing spirit that we will need to rebuild our country. It's that strength that we're going to need to create the new American future our children so much deserve. [applause]\nIn this new -- thank you. Thank you very much. In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the work force. And if I'm not elected president, that will never happen, believe me. They're talking to you, they're playing you, but believe me, you know the answer.\nAnd I have to say that I've been talking about Michigan and the car industry and how your businesses and plants have been ripped out of your land, and I have been doing it for four years to the people of Michigan. Other people started talking about it last week. They're not going to do anything about it.\nCrumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves. [applause]\nFamilies strapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity. Children stuck in failing government schools will be able to attend the school of their choice. [applause]\nGovernment will become lean, effective, responsible and honest. [applause]\nOur border will be protected and our children will be safe, very, very safe. [applause]\nAnd we will build the wall, don't worry about it. We will build the wall. [applause]\nLaw and order will be restored and the poorest places in our country will know safety and peace again. [applause]\nAmerican values and cultures will be cherished - and I mean cherished and celebrated once again. But to achieve this new American future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past, and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies over and over, and over again. [applause]\nNo group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans no group. No group. If Hillary Clinton's goal was to inflict pain on the African-American community, she could not have done a better job. It is a disgrace. [applause]\nTonight I'm asking for the vote of every single African-American citizen in this country who wants to see a better future. [applause]\nThe inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic party for more than 50 years. Their policies have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, and broken homes. It's time to hold democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities. At what point do we say enough? [applause]\nAt what point do we say enough? [applause]\nIt is time to hold failed leaders accountable for their results, not just their empty words over and over again. Look at what the democratic party has done to the city as an example and there are many others, of Detroit. 40 percent of Detroit's residents, 40 percent, live in poverty. Half of all Detroit residents do not work, and cannot work, and can't get a job\nDetroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime, number one. This is the legacy of the democratic politicians who have run this city. This is the result of the policy agenda embraced by crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing]\n33,000 e-mails gone. [booing]\nThe only way to change results is to change leadership. [applause]\nWe can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place. A new future requires brand new leadership. [applause]\nLook at how much African-American communities are suffering from democratic control. To those I say the following, what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose? [applause]\nI say it again, what do you have to lose? Look, you're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. 58% of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?\nAnd at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95% of the African American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce, I will produce for the inner cities and I will produce for the African Americans. And the Democrats will not produce and all they have done is taken advantage of your vote. That's all they've done. And once the election is over, they go back to their palaces in Washington. And you know what? They do nothing for you. Just remember it.\nSo, you have nothing to lose. One thing we know for sure: if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same, exactly the same, results.\nMy administration will go to work for you as no one has ever done before.\nWe will work. We will bring back jobs. We will work.\nBy contrast, the one thing every item in Hillary Clinton's agenda has in common is that it takes jobs and opportunities away from African American workers.\nIt takes jobs away from all workers because your companies are leaving Michigan. Your companies are leaving every single state in our union. They're going to Mexico. They're going everywhere but here.\nHillary Clinton supports open borders. Which means many things but it means people pouring and they take your jobs.\nWhether you like it or don't like it. They take your jobs.\nHer fierce opposition to school choice. You need choice. You have to get your children into good schools. You do that through competition. You need choice.\nHer plan to massively raise taxes on small business and everyone. $1.3 trillion tax increase. Where as I am cutting taxes very substantively for business and for the middle class.\nHer tremendous opposition to American energy. Her opposition is fierce and her record of giving our jobs away to many many other countries. America must reject the bigot dream of Hillary Clinton who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.\nHillary Clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas that to give that job to unemployed African American youth in cities like Detroit, who have become refugees in their own country.\nIt's time to get our country back to work and that includes an all out effort. To help young African Americans get the good paying jobs that they deserve.\nHillary Clinton's plan would bring in an estimated 620,000 refugees in her first term at a lifetime benefit cost of some $400 billion to our country. According to the Senate Immigration Subcommittee.\nHillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel. By the way, for the price of supporting one refugee in the United States, we could support 12 in a safe zone in the Middle East or let's say Syria.\nThe approved refugee screening standards that I have proposed will save countless, billions of dollars. It's called extreme vetting. Extreme vetting. [applause]\nWe will invest a portion of the money saved in the jobs program for inner city youth. The African American community has given so much to this country. They fought and died in every war since the Revolution.\nThey've lifted up the conscience of our nation in the long march towards civil rights. They've sacrificed so much for the national good. Yet, nearly 4 in 10 African Americans children still live in poverty and 58%, as I said, of African Americans are not working.\nThey cannot find a job.\nWe must do better as a country. I refuse to believe that the future must be like the past. It won't be. Our future will be a great future for everyone. For everyone. [applause]\nIn a Trump administration, all workers of all colors will get priorities for jobs in their own country which is about time.\nI want higher wages for African Americans, for Hispanic Americans, and for all Americans. We want higher wages [applause]\nMany, many workers in our country are making substantially less money today in real wages than they made 18 years ago.\nThey're working two jobs instead of one. They're working much harder as they get older and it's supposed to be the opposite.\nWe're gonna stop it. We're going to create great jobs and we're gonna get the wages up.\nHillary Clinton, is a throwback to an ugly past where politicians preyed on our poorest citizens while selling them out for personal gain. Promises, promises, all talk no action. All talk, no action politicians.\nThey talk, talk, talk. You vote them in with great fan fare and then they just do nothing.\nWith Trump, that is not going to happen. Believe me.\nWe must turn the page on yesterday, only a change in leadership will produce a change in outcomes. And we can't take, as a country, four more years of Obama. And that's what you get with Hillary Clinton but probably worse.\nIn this new American future, American workers will always come first. America first, always come first.\nThis will include a complete revitalization of the Michigan manufacturing sector. Now, you have to understand, the Michigan manufacturing sector is a disaster. Is a disaster.\nLook at your notes, look at your stats, look at what's happening to your state. You're losing your businesses. It's like taking candy away from a baby. And many people right now in this audience that think you have jobs, you're gonna find out very soon that your company is leaving from Mexico or some other place and you're not going to have your job for very long.\nAnd if Trump gets in, those days are over folks, they're over [applause]\nWe will be brining back our jobs to Michigan. There will be a very big price to pay for those companies that wanna leave our land, go someplace else, manufacture their goods, and sell back with no retribution.\nIt won't happen. There will be consequence. Won't happen. It will not happen.\nMichigan lost more than 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.\nAs you know, NAFTA, one of the worst trade bills in history maybe, maybe the worst trade bill signed in the history of the world. Not only in our country. Its emptied out Michigan, its emptied out New England. Its emptied out New York State. Its emptied out so many of our great companies.\nThey leave and they fire. We end up with devastation. We end up with unemployment. We end up with nothing.\nThe bill was signed by Bill Clinton. [booing]\nIt was supported by Hillary Clinton. [booing]\nRight here in this community, you have lost 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton put China into the World Trade Organization. Another Hillary Clinton back deal. She backs all the deals.\nAnd by the way, she will be backing Trans Pacific Partnership. TPP. If she is elected. Just mark your words. Just remember, you know it's gonna happen.\nShe considered it the gold standard. All of a sudden when she heard me talking about it, she said \"I can't win this one\" so she went against it. She will go back immediately, and you saw that when the governor of Virginia, who's her friend, said that was going to happen.\nDetroit lost more than 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs following the NAFTA and WTO agreements. That was supported very strongly by my opponent.\nNo industry, has been hurt more by Hillary Clinton's policies than the automobile industry or as we call it the car industry. It has been a total disaster.\nAccording to the Bureau of the Labor of Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is down to only 160,000 and it is going to be a lot lower because if you look at the massive plants being built right now in Mexico, car plants, folks, you can kiss these jobs goodbye. [booing]\nBut not me. Not with me. It won't happen. [applause]\nIn 2014, General Motors announced plans to double its investments in Mexico by plans by 2018. Not good. [booing]\nIn April 2016, Ford Motor Company announced plans to invest another $1.6 billion constructing an auto plant in Mexico. Mexico will become the car capital of the world very, very quickly. And Michigan is going to end up with lots of empty buildings all over the place unless you elect Donald Trump president. In which case, it's not gonna happen. [applause]\nIn same month, Fiat Chrysler announced 1,300 layoffs. The list goes on and on. We will turn it around, we will turn it around fast. We will meet with these companies and we will say, it will not be easy for you to move your plant to Mexico for you sell your cars through what will be a very strong border, and for you not to pay tax on those cars coming in, okay? [applause]\nAnd when we tell them that there will be a substantial tax on the cars that they make in Mexico and other places, number one, they're not going to move in the first place, and number two, if they do, our country will make one heck of a lot of money. [applause]\nBut to save your jobs and do all of the things that I'm talking about, we have to win on November 8th. [applause]\nThe destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Transpacific Partnership is approved. It will be almost, nothing is as bad as NAFTA, but it will be almost as bad as NAFTA.\nWe know from Hillary's closest friend, that she is planning to ram through TPP if she's elected. She even called it, as I said, the gold standard. Its passage would be a disaster for Michigan, in particular, for the car industry in particular, for the people of Michigan. I won't let it happen. [applause]\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the United States trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over one million manufacturing jobs in our country in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parks, which lost nearly 740,000 think of that 740,000 manufacturing jobs. Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to trade deficit with TPP members.\nJust imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if Hillary gets her wish and approves TPP. It will not be pretty. That's why I have announced that we will withdrawal from the deal before that deal can ever, ever, ever happen. [applause]\nI have have previously laid out a detailed seven-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation from countries like China and tariffs against any nation that cheats by unfairly subsidizing their goods, of which many of them do. [applause]\nMy plan also includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA so our jobs can come back. [applause]\nAnd if we can't make a much, much better deal than we have right now, we will walk. [applause]\nI'm not in any way, shape or form an isolationist. I don't believe in it, but we have to make great deals for our country. We're losing in our whole trade negotiation with all countries over $800 billion a year. That's our trade deficit. Who negotiates these deals? We want great trade deals and we will have them. [applause]\nBut we want trade deals that work for America, that create jobs and wealth for our country, that work for the American worker. [applause]\nWe want to shrink our almost $800 billion trade deficit. We don't want to expand it, and it's been expanding for years. For years and years. You look at the charts up, up, up, up, up. And I say to myself so often, why don't they do something about it? And the reason is we have political hacks as our negotiators.\nWe have politicians as our negotiators. We have politicians that are controlled like Hillary Clinton by her donors, her special interests and her lobbyists and they won't let her do what's right for our workers and for our country.\nWe want to be leading the world in production, exports and manufacturing. We want jobs to leave from other countries and come into our country for a change. [applause]\nAnother major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another. Beginning with the support for going to war in Iraq, and I opposed it so strongly.\nNobody cared. I was a civilian, but I opposed it. I said you will have a total destabilization of the Middle East. It was such common sense and look what happened. Her tenure as secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in United States history. But she is totally without remorse. Her failed decisions as secretary of State unleashed ISIS onto the world. [booing]\nBut has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused? No.\nLook at the world before and after she became Secretary of State. Pre-Hillary in the early 2009s, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Libya was somewhat stable. Syria was under control. The group we now know today, ISIS, was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked by sanctions.\nNow, take a look at what we have. Fast forward to the present time.\nAfter Hillary, here is what it looks like. Iraq is in total chaos. Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States, where we're taking in thousands and thousands and thousands of people. ISIS has been unleashed unto the entire world.\nIran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, was given $400 million in ransom payment cash [booing]\nVery much like you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, Obamacare a total disaster. It will be repealed. It will be replaced. [applause]\nHillary Clinton is a legacy of death, destruction, and terrorism. America deserves a better legacy.\nAll of you deserve a much, much, better future.\nI am the change agent. I am the change agent. [applause]\nI am your messenger. And I said it many times, I'm nothing more than your messenger. It's a message of strong defense, common sense, take care of our vets, great education, get rid of Common Core, great health care, get rid of Obamacare, save our Second Amendment. [applause]\nWhich is under tremendous siege right now.\nHillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo or what we have. While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time. Our country was losing. Our people were losing, but she is cashing in.\nBill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State. He was paid almost $50 million for speeches during her tenure, an increase in 44 percent over the previous four years.\nBy the way, things came out today that blow everything away today. Then there was all of the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations. It was pay for play. [booing]\nYet, Hillary Clinton, who is indifferent to the suffering she has caused, has no remorse at all. She offers no apologies. No apologies for unleashing ISIS. No apologies for her open borders. No apologies for lying about her e-mails or about Benghazi. [booing]\nThe only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 e-mails that she deleted.\nAnd the only way to get justice in this rigged system is to show up and vote on November 8th and vote big, big, big. [applause]\nAnd I will bring your jobs back. So are you ready to vote?\nAnd what about your future? Is it going to be great, good, or terrible?\nGreat. So if you're ready to vote for honest government and the honest government that you deserve, a Trump administration will end the corruption and restore integrity to government service. Remember, I'm funding my campaign, I'm spending tremendous amounts of money on running for office.\nI'm raising money for the Republican Party and the Republican National Committee, which I think is doing a very good job, but I'll tell you more about that on November 8th. I'll let you know if they do a good job or if they do not such a good job. But I think they're going to do a great job.\nNo one will be above the law in a Trump administration. The State Department will work for the country, not for Hillary Clinton's donors. [applause]\nAnd I will work for you and I will work for no one else. I will work for you. I will never lie to you. I will never put any other interests before you and I will never, ever stop fighting for you. Never. [applause]\nThe government will work for the people again. That means we are only going to admit individuals into our country who support our values and we're not going to issue visas where adequate screening controls take place. We are going to make sure that we have total screening, and without it, we cannot continue to have our government run like this. We will also seek to join in partnership with any nation that wishes to join us in defeating and destroying ISIS. [applause]\nAt home, taxes will go down, especially for look, I mean, it's going to go down for a lot of people, for business they're going down, businesses are going to flourish, they're going to come pouring back. But taxes will go down, especially for middle-income Americans. [applause]\nAnd small business rates will be lowered to 15 percent so we can put millions of new jobs into our poorest neighborhoods. [applause]\nAs I said, Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. Voters, not special interests, will be in charge finally. We are going to bring our country together again. We have a divided country. It's totally divided. The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity, total unity. We will love each other. We will have one county. Everybody will work together. [applause]\nWe are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. It's time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve. [applause]\nIn my administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people. [applause]\nThis is the change I am promising to all of you; an honest government with low taxes, a thriving economy and a just society for each and every American. It's time to vote for a new American future. [applause]\nTogether, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America united again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. God bless you. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you very much, Michigan. Thank you.\n","123":"\nI'd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.\nWe are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt \u2013 and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.\nOur prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.\nWe are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.\nTonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.\nLast week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.\nOn Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nOn Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.\nLet me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.\nThe chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end \u2013 and it will end very quickly.\nEvery single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.\nTo be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.\nWe cannot make America great again if we leave any community behind.\nNearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.\nJobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.\nBut to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.\nAs you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct \u2013 it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.\nSometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.\nBut one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.\nI speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.\nI speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.\nI speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need \u2013 and so many are not making it. They are dying.\nI speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.\nOur campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals \u2013 who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.\nThese are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.\nI am fighting for these forgotten Americans.\nFourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.\nEvery day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight ofour lives \u2013 together \u2013 to save our country.\nI refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.\nOur whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.\nWhen I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.\nIn the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.\nIf something isn't working, you replace it.\nIf a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.\nI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\nThat's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always \u2013 and I mean always \u2013 come first.\nAren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?\nAren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.\nAren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?\nThat is all about to change \u2013 and it's about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.\nI've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.\nIn this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.\nAnd, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.\nI have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign \u2013 nobody else is.\nMy only interest is the American people.\nSo while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.\nThe American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.\nTell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?\nHas Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?\nHas she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?\nHas she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?\nHas she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?\nHas Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?\nSpeaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don't pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages \u2013 openly and blatantly \u2013 just like he lied about Obamacare.\nNow the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. Hillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.\nLet's talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.\nBill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization \u2013 another Hillary Clinton-backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State \u2013 our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.\nHillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.\nAnother major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.\nI've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.\nMy opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.\nBut where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?\nWhere was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?\nThese moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don't get apologies. They'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.\nBut they will always come first to me.\nListen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.\nHillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.\nPlease remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.\nInstead, I will be a champion for the people.\nThe establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.\nJust imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed \u2013 she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.\nJust imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.\nJust think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools. Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.\nInstead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders. It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.\nSo many people suffering in silence. No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.\nSo again, it's not about me. It's never been about me. It's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.\nI am running to be their voice.\nI am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.\nI am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again \u2013 including some powerful people in my own party. Because it means I am fighting for real change.\nThere's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nThe insiders fighting for the insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nHere is the change I propose.\nOn terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.\nWe will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.\nOn immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people. Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa. If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.\nWe will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.\nMy opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration. Hillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.\nWe have enough problems already, we don't need another one.\nOn crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world. We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.\nThe gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one. Their day is over.\nOn trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.\nHillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.\nOn taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses \u2013 creating millions of new good paying jobs.\nWe are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.\nOn education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones. My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.\nWe are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities \u2013 and what a big difference that will make. This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.\nOn healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare \u2013 at a much lower cost.\nOn political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.\nIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.\nI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.\nI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.\nFinally, we are going to bring this country together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.\nIf African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing. Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership \u2013 look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working. It is time for change.\nWhat do you have to lose by trying something new? \u2013 I will fix it. This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.\nHillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.\nIt is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.\nIn my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\nThis is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.\nBut we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.\n72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.\nIt is time to vote for a New American Future.\nTogether, We will make America strong again.\nWe will make American proud again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nFriends and fellow citizens: Come November, we will make America great again.\nThank You, and God Bless.\n","124":"\nIt's so great to be here tonight. I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Priebus, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\nWe are at a decisive moment in this election.\nLast week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country. Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism. Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.\nLet me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.\nThe violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.\nLaw and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.\nThe main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods. It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.\nThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.\nThe narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one. The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.\nMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.\nJust like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.\nThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society \u2013 a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent \u2013 share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.\nThey have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.\nEverytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives \u2013 whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore \u2013 and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.\nDuring the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded. More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began.\nHow are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?\nThe war on our police must end. It must end now.\nThe war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.\nOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor. Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school.\nFor every one violent protestor, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night. My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.\nHillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.\nI care too much about my country to let that happen.\nWe all care too much about our country to let that happen.\nGood policing saves lives. My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this. The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.\nImagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn't blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City? I'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.\nIt's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force. I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.\nHillary Clinton has had her chance. She failed. Now it's time for new leadership.\nThe Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.\nThere is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people. It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American \u2013 and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.\nI am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.\nIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.\nThe Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.\nLet us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade. Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings. 18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims. The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average. Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job. Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty. 55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it's one of the worst public school systems in the country.\n1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.\nTo every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.\nThe Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted. They've just assumed they'll get your support and done nothing in return for it. It's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it's time to rebuild the inner cities of America \u2013 and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.\nI'm not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me. I've been paying my own way. The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.\nThe other party \u2013 the Democratic Party \u2013 nominated the personification of special interest corruption. The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.\nI am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help. The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.\nJobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation.\nWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future. She doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.\nThe African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party. It's time to break with the failures of the past \u2013 I want to offer Americans a new future.\nIt is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.\nEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton. The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nInsiders fighting for insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nWhen we talk about the insider, who are we talking about? It's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests. It's the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill. It's the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition out of existence. The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.\nEvery day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and you hear about some self-interest banker or some discredited Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.\nI wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting \u2013 all of us across the country are fighting \u2013 for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\nThe leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.\nI am going to give the people their voice back.\nThink about it. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.\nThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.\nThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.\nAren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?\nAren't you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?\nAre you ready for change?\nAre you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first?\nLet's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America. It's time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests. I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system \u2013 a lot of people who've created our problems \u2013 will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.\nIt's time to stop making the special interests rich. It's time to make the American people rich.\nI am going to Make America Wealthy again.\nThe Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.\nThey've ruined the schools.\nThey've driven out the jobs.\nThey've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.\nViolent crime has risen 17% in America's 50 largest cities last year. Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent. Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.\nThis is the future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same. The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.\nIt is time for a different future.\nHere is what I am proposing.\nFirst, on immigration. No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community. Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans. I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.\nOn trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.\nOn taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores \u2013 and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.\nI am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee. Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.\nOn education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first.\nHillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.\nI am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.\nOn crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods. To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.\nOn healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare \u2013 which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases \u2013 and give choice to patients and consumers. Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out \u2013 as are many of the major insurance companies.\nOn government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government. We've seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense. We've seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.\nIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.\nI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.\nI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning.\nWe are going to make this a government of the people once again. This is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you. The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.\nThese are tough times. But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.\nTo do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.\nI will be your fighter.\nTo defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina. Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina. She cannot win for you.\nMost importantly, she has bad judgment. Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.\nThe only individuals she's ever delivered for is her donors \u2013 not the people.\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again. My opponent asks her supporters to repeat a three-word pledge. Her pledge reads: \"I'm With Her\"\nI choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: \"I'm With You \u2013 the American people.\"\nI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity \u2013 a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.\nTo every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nTogether, We will make America strong again.\nWe will make American safe again.\nAnd we will make America great again.\nThank you, and God Bless.\n","125":"\nThank you, everybody, thank you very much. It's great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make America safe again. In the twentieth century, the United States has defeated fascism, Nazism and communism. Now, a different threat faces our world: radical Islamic terrorism.\nThis summer, there's been an ISIS attack launched outside the warzones of the Middle East--hard to believe--every eighty-four hours. Here in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another: thirteen were murdered and thirty-eight wounded in the assault on Fort Hood. The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed sixty-four people, and ultimately left five dead, including two of our great police officers . In Chattanooga, Tennessee, five unarmed Marines--unbelievable people, by the way--were shot and killed at a military recruiting center.\nLast September, fourteen innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino; another twenty-two were very gravely injured. In June, forty-nine Americans were executed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando . Another fifty-three were badly injured. It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack, by far, the worst on the LGBTQ community, and I'll tell you what: we can never, ever allow this to happen again. [applause]\nIn Europe--thank you--in Europe we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed afflicted upon our closest allies. In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. Twelve were killed, including two police officers, and 11 were wounded. Two days later, four were murdered in a Jewish delicatessen. In November of 2015 terrorist went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368 people, some in very, very, very bad shape today.\nFrance is suffering gravely. And the tourism industry is being massively affected in the most negative way. In March of this year terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport killing 32 and injuring 340 people. This July in the South of France an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder, plowing down and killing 85 men, women and children and wounding 308 people.\nTerrible. Among the dead were two Americans, a Texas father and his 11-year-old son. A few weeks ago in Germany a refugee armed with an axe wounded 5 people in a gruesome train attack. Only days ago an ISIS killer invaded a Christian Church in Normandy, France forced an 85- year-old priest to his knees. A priest who was beloved, who was beloved; before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things.\nOverseas ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another. Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings, and drownings, ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution. Holy sites desecrated. Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination. ISIS rounding up what it calls 'Nation of the Cross', 'Nation of the Cross' in a campaign of absolute and total genocide.\nWe cannot let this evil continue. [applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nNor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam, it's oppression of women, gays, children and non-believers be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries. [applause] We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we've faced at every age and before. But we will not, we will not, remember this, defeat it with closed eyes or silenced voices. We have a president that doesn't want to say the words.\nAnyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [applause] Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president. [applause] The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton. Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama-Clinton administration took over.\nLibya was stable. Syria was under control. Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States.\nIraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.\nFast forward to today. What we have--and think of this--and the decisions made by the Obama\/Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous.\nLibya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other really brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations.\nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.\nIn Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways of the world. Iraq is in chaos. And ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West.\nIn 2014, ISIS was operating in seven nations. They were in seven nations. Terrible, but that's what it was.\nToday they're fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more for a total of 24. And many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries. They don't even know.\nThe situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. A new congressional report reveals that the Administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS with 40 percent of analysts saying they had experience efforts to manipulate their findings in trying to make it look much better than it is. It's bad.\nAt the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and to the United States. Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is not flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States. Plus if you remember from two weeks ago, another $400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom.\nWorst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama\/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran, which chants, \"death to America\", in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring a dominant world power.\nIt all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama's global apology tour. We all remember. We all remember. [Booing] In a series of speeches, President Obama described America as arrogant, dismissive, derisive, and a colonial power. He was describing us.\nHe informed other countries that he would be speaking up about America's past errors. He pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms. He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes, and described Guantanamo Bay as a rallying cry for our enemies.\nPerhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obama's speech to the Muslim world, delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009. I remember it well.\nIn winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the USSR the Evil Empire. Yet when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found. Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record--and remember this, our human rights--and theirs.\nThe records are unbelievable and unmistakable.\nHis naive words were followed by even more naive actions. The failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in Iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS without question. [applause]\nThe failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton's disaster, total disaster, in Libya. President Obama has since said that he regrets, and really regrets, Libya and the mistake he made. He considers it his worst mistake. According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton's forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor. That's why we went in.\nWith one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton's policies launched ISIS onto the world stage. Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country. The Middle East in particular.\nThe Clintons made almost $60,000 in gross income while she was secretary of state. It is unbelievable. Incident after incident proves again and again Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment--as said by Bernie Sanders--stability and temperament and the moral character to lead our nation. [applause]\nImportantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face. Not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around. [applause]\nIt is now time for a new approach. Our current strategy of nation- building and regime-change is a proven, absolute failure. We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning. A major difference between me and my opponent. Though I was a private citizen whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion. I was against, believe me.\nThree months before the invasion I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery, that \"perhaps we shouldn't be doing it yet. And that the economy is a much bigger problem.\"\nIn August of 2004, very early, right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire Magazine in an interview. Here's the quote in full. \"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess we're in. I would never have handled it that way.\" This was right after the invasion. \"Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? C'mon.\"\nI then continued, \"Two minutes after we leave there's going to be a revolution and the meanest, toughest, smartest most viscous guy, in this case, guy, will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have.\n\"What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side. The tremendous damage done. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All of this death and destruction for nothing.\"\nSo I've been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in. But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.\nAfter we had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal on a timetable advertised to our enemies. They said, we're moving out, here's our time, here's our date. Who would do this but an incompetent president?\nAl Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated. And Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world. By that same token President Obama and Hillary Clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt.\nOne more point on this. I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq. [applause] I said it over and over and over again. Another area where my judgment has been proven correct. I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed, keep the oil, keep the oil.\nAccording to CNN, ISIS made as much as $500,000 in oil sales in 2014 alone. That's before they really got started. Fueling and funding its reign of terror. If we had controlled the oil like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S. forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil.\nI was saying this constantly and consistently to whomever would listen. I said, \"Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Don't let somebody else get it.\" [applause] If they had listened to me then we would have had the economic benefits of the oil which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war. [applause] In addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved. This proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets. We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils. [applause] Instead, all we got from Iraq and our ventures in the Middle East, was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss. But it's time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course. [applause]\nIf I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end. [applause] Thank you. Our new approach--which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East--must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally. Very important. Some don't share this goal. We cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies. [applause]\nAs president, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal. We will work side by side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally Israel. [applause] We will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan and the president of Egypt, President Sisi, and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished. [applause]\nWe will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats. Very good. Very, very good.\nI also believe that we could find common ground with Russia in a fight against ISIS. Wouldn't that be a good thing? Wouldn't that be a good thing? [applause] They, too, have much at stake in the outcome in Syria, and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism just as bad as ours. They have a big, big problem in Russia with ISIS.\nMy administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS. International cooperation to cut off their funding. Expanded intelligence sharing, and cyber warfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting. Their recruiting is taking place right now, and they're setting records. It's got to be stopped. [applause]\nWe cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy. We must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do it immediately--immediately. [applause]\nUnlike Hilary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless of handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are. [applause] And by the way, what's happened with her 33,000 e-mails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America. [applause]\nI've often said that the great General Douglas MacArthur and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to recklessly announce their every move before it happens. Like they did in Iraq, so that the enemy can prepare and adapt. Their enemy says, \"Thank you.\"\nThe fight will not be limited to ISIS. We will decimate Al- Qaeda. And we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah. [applause] So important. We can use existing U.N. Security Council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions. Military, cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism.\nBut we must use ideological warfare as well. Very important. And they use it on us, better than we have ever even thought of using it on them. But that will change.\nJust as we won, just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam. While my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death, my administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different beliefs. [applause]\nOur administration would be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices. This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings. Over 1,000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year.\nRecently a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family. In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said, \"Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions.\" Shockingly, this is a tradition that has reached our own shores. One such case, and many, many cases have happened--where one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter, claiming she had been \"too Westernized.\"\nTo defeat Islamic terrorism we must also speak our forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow. It's a breeding ground. It's a terrible, terrible breeding ground.\nA new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well. [applause] The common thread linking the major Islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred on our soil--9\/11, the Fort Hood shooting, the Boston bombing, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando attack--is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants.\nClearly, new screening procedures are needed. A review by the U.S. Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between 9\/11 and 2014, and many more since then, and this year is a record for identification. It's gotten worse, far worse.\nWe also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country, as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota.\nBeyond terrorism, as we have also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them. In Cologne, Germany on New Years, we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows.\nPew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large number of immigrants--extreme views about religion such death penalty--and for those who are involved--the death penalty is very, very common if you don't have the faith that they demand you have.\nA Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough, and we will be even extreme. [applause] We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme--extreme vetting.\nOur country has enough problems. We don't need more, and these are problems like we've never had before. [applause]] In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles, or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. [applause] Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country. [applause] Only those who we expect to flourish in our country, and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas. [applause] To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world, that have a history of exporting terrorism, nor for us! Not for us. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you. As soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place, there are many such regions. We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume, based on new circumstances or new procedures. The size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening. [applause] We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year . Beyond that, we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions--hundreds of thousands . If we don't control the numbers, we can't perform adequate screening. There's no way it can take place. [applause]\nBy contrast, my opponent wants to increase--which is unbelievable, no matter who you are, where you come from--wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% over what they are now. [Boos] The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary's plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term , assuming no cuts to other refugee programs--so it could get worse! This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers. The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department's placement figures. Think of this: $400 billion. In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel. [Boos] And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe. We have enough problems in our country. We don't need more.\nLastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures. Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. The 9\/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications. Almost every one of them. It said practically in big bold letters \"fraud\". And nobody saw it. The Russians warned us about the Boston bombers, here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI. Very sad.\nThe female San Bernardino shooter, on her--on her statements, and everything that she said: she was here on a fianc\u00e9e visa, which most people have not even heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to support very openly jihad online. These are the people we're taking in.\nA neighbor saw suspicious behavior--bombs on the floor, and other things--but didn't warn authorities because they said they didn't want to be accused of racial profiling. Now, many are dead and many more are gravely wounded.\nThe shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9\/11 . He, too, was interviewed by the FBI. His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime, and expressed anti-American views very strongly , and by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face, all the way through her speech. [Boos] He obviously liked what she had to say. It's called: weakness, weakness. It's called stupidity, and we've had it. [applause]\nThe Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another. He even proclaimed that we \"love death more then you love life\". Not good. These warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society. [applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nThat is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam, which will include reformers voices in the Muslim community, who will hopefully work with us. We want to build bridges and erase divisions. The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization. This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners. And while I'm at it, we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials. [applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nWe will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence. Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations. [applause] Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions. [applause]\nFinally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support to terrorism. There will be consequences for those people. There will be very serious consequences. [applause] Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country. [applause] To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission. The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed, one-by-one, viciously if necessary--viciously if necessary. Immigration offices will also have their powers restored. Those have been taken away. Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they don't immediately, we will return them home.\nTo make America safe again, we must work together again. Our victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus. That is what we must have to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. [applause]\nBut just like we couldn't defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists, or explaining its horrible evils, we can't defeat radical Islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing. We have to explain that it exists, and explain the difficulties. We have to have a leader that can do that, and we do not have that now.\nBut this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life. We have an exceptional country, an exceptional way of life. But it's being tread on by sick, sick people. And expecting that as newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and do the same. Pride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those that come into our society and want to join our society. [applause]\nAssimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion. Our system of government and our American culture is the best in the world, and we'll produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it. [applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nThis approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country. Renewing the spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country, of which there are so many. We have a divider as president. We call him the Great Divider. It's the thing he best. [applause] It will do so by emphasizing what we have in common, not what pulls us apart.\nThis is my pledge to the American People: as your president, I will be your single greatest champion. I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. [applause] We will reject bigotry and hatred, and oppression, in all of its ugly forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American People. Only this way will we make America great again, and safe again--for everyone. Thank you very much, God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]\n","126":"\nThank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Unbelievable. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you. [applause]\nAmazing. Amazing. What great people.\nWe're going to bring back our jobs to Pennsylvania. We're going to bring back our jobs to the United States. [applause]\nGoing to bring back our jobs, folks. I've looked at the numbers and I see what's happening in Pennsylvania. I see what's happening all over our country.\nYou look at New York state, you look at New England, you look anywhere in the country where you want to go to, all over it's the same. Manufacturing way down, jobs way down. You go to other countries, they're taking our companies, they're taking our jobs.\nPeople are right now working harder than they've ever worked. Eighteen years ago they made more money in real wages, 18 years, think of it. Eighteen years ago many of the people in this incredibly big room, and thank you for being here, you know it's 93 degrees out. [applause]\nAnd they still have a lot of people trying to get in, I don't know if they can get them in. Should we let them in? Just let them in. [applause]\nBut 18 years ago, people were making more money in real wages than they make today. And today they're working two jobs, some people are working three jobs. So they're older, and they're working harder, and they're making less money, all right? A friend of mine, I've been telling this story over the last month because it's better than going to Wharton or better than going to Harvard and asking them to do a study, because you learn it in three minutes.\nBut let me just tell you. Right now, Mexico and other countries are building facilities, plants, the likes of which you've never seen. We're going to build the wall, don't worry, we're going to build the wall, we're going to build it, we're going to build it. [applause]\nBut a friend of mine, and actually a supporter, big supporter, great guy. He builds plants, that's what he does, he builds plants. He doesn't want to build apartments, he doesn't want to build office buildings, he wants to build plants. And he's just about the biggest there is. And I said how are things going? He said very well, how are you doing in the U.S.? Not good. How are you doing in Mexico?\nHe said Donald do you want to see, it's the eighth wonder of the world. They are building plants, the likes of which I've never seen. He's building some of the greatest plants, big\u2014you look at Ford moving vast operations to Mexico. The plants. You look at\u2014look at, take a look. By the way, millions of jobs, thousands of companies over the years, they've left us. And we have a few things. We have unemployment, we have empty plants, I saw up in New York state, I saw it in Pennsylvania, you were great to meet, you voted a big victory for Donald Trump, thank you. [applause]\nThat was a big victory. I mean I assumed I was going\u2014if I don't win Pennsylvania\u2014and by the way, I was talking to our great Congressman, and where is he? He's here some place, where is he? [applause]\nHe loves the people, and I have to say, of all of Pennsylvania he wants to see this state do well. Thank you. But just talking back to a few of my friends that live here, we have a few of the friends and we see what's happened with General Electric where they're cutting way back. Not going to happen. And you know why they're cutting back, it's one reason. Because we don't take care of our miners and we're not producing coal.\nAnd they don't need to make those big, big beautiful, you could call them locomotives I guess, right? Whatever the hell they are, they're big and they're powerful and they don't need them like they used to because we don't make our government work for us. They're not working for us. They're working for others, they're not working for us. So when General Electric goes out and you see the numbers, I see the numbers, and it's about coal, so I just left parts of Virginia and West Virginia, and the coal industry's decimated.\nThe miners are out of work, they're totally out of work. I mean there will be no such thing as coal in this country pretty soon. And we're talking clean coal, we're talking clean coal.\nSo I was with the miners, we have such tremendous support, West Virginia, the mining parts of Virginia. All over, Ohio, because Hillary Clinton made the statement not so long ago. A number of months she said, we're going to put the mines and miners out of business. All right? Going to put the mines and the miners \u2013 so [booing]\nSo, we're not going to let that happen. We're not going to let that happen and we're not going to let it happen in Pennsylvania because you know what? A lot of your miners have already lost their jobs, but you have a lot of other jobs that are very reliant on the mines. Like, as an example, General Electric. And what we're going to do, folks, is going to be so special. We're going to bring it back. We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to bring back our companies. [applause]\nWhen a company wants to leave our country to go to another country and think they're going to make their product, and because our politicians are weak, stupid, taken care of by lobbyists, special interests\u2014they're taken care of by lobbyists, they're taken care of by donors and special interests. That's what\u2014you know, a friend of mine\u2014very smart guy\u2014said\u2014I can't believe it. We're talking about a deal that took place about a month ago.\nHe said, I can't believe they could have gotten that through. I said, Why can't you believe it? Well, it's so bad for the country. I said, Yeah, but it's good for the politician because they're taken care of by their lobbyists and their donors and the special interests.\nSo even though you say we want, as an example, General Electric to produce more, if they don't want to or if for some reason one of the donors of crooked Hillary Clinton doesn't want that to happen, even though it's great for Erie, even though it's great you, even though it's great for the state of Pennsylvania, then it's not going to happen, folks. It's not going to happen.\nAnd by the way\u2014and I have to tell you this. So when they think they're going to take our companies are rip them out of\u2014as an example\u2014this area or this state or any other state and go to Mexico and build massive new plants and employ people other than you, and you're going to lose your jobs or you're going to now get two part- time jobs that don't add up to half of what you used to make. That stuff isn't happening anymore. So here's what happens. They're going to build that plant. Now, if I were here five years ago and if President Obama put me and maybe secretary of keeping business in the United States\u2014that's my title, secretary of keeping business in the United States. [applause]\nI mean, I like the sound of secretary of defense better. Oh, and by the way, we're going to build our military. We're going to be very strong. [applause]\nReally. And we're going to take care of our vets. We're going to take care of our vets, believe me. [applause]\nBut I like the sound\u2014I like the sound of secretary of Defense. I like the sound of secretary of the Treasury. I like the sound of secretary of State. But I'll tell you, would I be good at keeping jobs over here. Would I be... [applause]\nI'll tell you this. I just have to say the Bernie Sanders protesters were much, much stronger. They had much more passion, I have to say. [applause]\nAll right. You know what's interesting? If I could speak to them for like five minutes\u2014we want a strong military, we want to take care of our people, we want good education, we want good housing, we want good healthcare. What do we want? We're all in for the same thing. [applause]\nReally amazing. Really amazing. So I'll be your secretary of keeping companies in the United States, right? So, I would go to a company like Carrier Air Conditioner, which decided to leave Indianapolis, Indiana, and I would say here's the story.\nWe think it's wonderful that you're negotiating with Mexico. I'm sure you're going to have a wonderful plant, but here's what's going to happen. If you build that plant and you fire all of these people, 1400 people who were so great to me.\nIndiana, I won that in a landslide. Actually, the timing was good. I won it in a landslide because I know what to do. Hillary doesn't know what to do. Did you see her yesterday? She has no clue about what we're talking about. Folks, she has no clue. She has no clue. Crooked Hillary. She doesn't know anything about it and, by the way, if she did, she couldn't do it anyway because her donors don't want to do it. There's reasons.\nBut look, look. I would go to them and say just to keep them. Just to keep them. And I wouldn't even care that much. I'll tell you why. Ready? I'd say here's the story.\nIf you leave, in this case, Indianapolis, you're going to go to Mexico, you're going to make your air conditioning units. Every single unit that you make that crosses our now very, very strong border we're going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit. OK? Thirty five percent. Right?\nSo simple. Thirty five percent the cost of that unit. We hope you enjoy your new plant. Very hot weather out there, very hot. We hope you enjoy your new plant, but 35 percent is coming to us. Now, here's what's going to happen if they haven't moved yet. A lot of them have moved.\nWe've lost thousands and thousands of companies, we've lost millions of jobs - too late. I should have been there 10 years ago. Nobody would have left. Nobody would have left because you need the right messenger, you know, I'm your messenger in terms of this movement.\nBut you need the right person saying it. So, here's what's going to happen. Normally they'd call up whoever it is that was putting the little order down like the new president and they'd have one of their lobbyists call up and they'd say Hillary, I'm sorry, you can't do that, they gave you $2 million for your campaign. Can't do that, Hillary. OK, I won't do that.\nWith me, I'm putting my money up, folks. I'm putting my money up. Putting my money up. We're raising money for Reince and for the RNC, but that's for a lot of other reasons. We are putting - I'm putting a lot of money up. I financed my - I funded, not financed, I wish I financed, right? I funded but I funded my primaries and I spent less than anybody else in terms of the measures. So, here's a story - wouldn't that be nice?\nI spent less and won in a landslide. Other people spent much, much more. Three, four, five times more and they came in seventh. Who the hell do you want to have as your president, right? Right? Right? Oh, boy, and then they don't like me - couple of them, most of them have really supported us, but some of them just can't get over it. You know what I say to them? Get over it. We're just having fun. Get over it.\nYou signed a pledge, I hereby guarantee that I will endorse whoever wins - you know, the funny thing, all those pledges, you know they were signed for different - they were signed so that I would sign it. And I would have honored it, I will say. Even if I wasn't fond or didn't like - I would have honored it because a pledge is a very important thing. But here's the thing. So, we are going to take these companies that haven't left - now, I'm looking at your numbers folks, you're not doing too well.\nYou're not doing too well here. Pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since - you know, that's massive, since NAFTA. NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton and I believe it's the single worst trade document ever signed in the history of our country and probably in the history of our world.\nIt's one of the most one-sided documents that I've ever seen. And it allowed Mexico and places to do unbelievably well at our expense. And did you see where say, I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA, I'm going to\u2014TPP disaster. Ok, don't worry. Don't worry.\nAnd Hillary was in favor of TPP. She said it's the gold standard. Thank you for reminding me. I like this guy. It's the gold standard. TPP. Transpacific Partnership. It is going to be\u2014I don't think you can be worse than NAFTA honestly. But it's going to be as bad as NAFTA. So TPP, she said it is the gold standard. She's reading it from a teleprompter. It is the gold standard\u2014oh, boy. Our country is in trouble. Our country is in trouble. Our country is in trouble.\nSo she said it's the gold standard. But when she heard me make a speech, as I understand it. And she heard me talking very negatively about it. As an example, they don't talk devaluation, which is the single greatest tool that these countries are using to kill the United States, including China. They devalue their currency. Well, it doesn't happen. Number one thing is not mentioned.\nSo complicated, this agreement. Too many countries. By the way, I believe trade. I believe in trade deals. One country at a time. Boom. Boom. Boom. You got to see the lines. We'll have one line. And if they don't do well.\nIf they don't behave themselves, if they want to start devaluing their currency all over the place, very simple, we write them a notice like we do in business. We serve them with a 30 day notice. [applause]\nAnd by the way, you just saw, how great are our police, right? [applause]\nLaw and order. We need law and order. We need law and order and we will have law and order. Our police, our firemen - but our police do a fantastic job. They are not recognized for the great job they do. If they have 500,000 incidents all positively, beautifully handled, one bad thing happens, that one bad thing is on the news for two weeks and it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace.\nSo we should be very thankful for the job they do. So, Pennsylvania is losing a lot of its business. Right now, we're sitting here, we're talking - oh, here's another one. Go home to Mom. Go home to Mom. [applause]\nAnd your mother is voting for trump! She's voting for Trump. It's true. It's true.\nBy the way, just to interject - so I was told this whole area is Democratic, meaning Democrat. And I was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said I can't believe that you have 10,000 people, you have people outside trying to get in.\nThey said, the came up to me, this is - happens to be a Democrat who I happen to know is a good guy\u2014came up to me and said I've never seen anything like it. It always goes Democrat. Is that a correct statement? Said, you are going to win Erie in a and the surrounding area - you're going to win in a landslide. Gonna be a landslide. [applause]\nBecause people are tired of lies, they're tired of losing their jobs, they're tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places. They're tired of China coming in and dropping steel all over the place to put your companies out of business, so we have to go to China to get our steel, which is happening very quickly.\nAnd that's why the steel workers are with me, that's why the miners are with me, that's why the working people, electricians, the plumbers, the sheetrockers, the concrete guys and gals, they're all - they're with us.\nAnd I grew up, you know they say, you know you're really rich, how come you sort of relate to these people? Well, my father built houses and I used to work in these houses and I got to know the electricians, I got to know all these people, I got to know the plumbers, the steamfitters\u2014I got to know them all.\nAnd I liked them better than the rich people that I know. I know a lot of rich people. It's true. They're better. I like them better.\nSo, anyway\u2014and, we are going to put people back to work. We're not playing games. And it's going to go quickly. By the way, it's going to go quickly.\nBut look at this, OK. So, Erie, has lost one in three manufacturing jobs. You know that, all I\u2014you do\u2014I flew over, you're looking at the plants, plants that 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, some two years ago, were vibrant.\nBut no plant two years ago was too vibrant because it was down to half, down to a quarter, down to a tenth, and then ultimately they closed, but you see them. They are falling over. The rain, the sleet, the snow, the wind. These are great buildings that are falling apart. Don't feel bad, all over the country. Upstate New York is a disaster, which Hillary Clinton said that she was going to fix.\nOK, so the Washington Post is extraordinarily dishonest and that's fine. But they wrote a story, I couldn't believe I saw this story, they talked about Hillary Clinton. It was a headline, Hillary Clinton and when she ran for the United States Senator from New York, she said to the people in upstate New York, which was starting to really have problems because of her husband's bill NAFTA.\nAnd companies were leaving, tremendous unemployment, tremendous problems, making nothing and she said I will turn it around, I will create 200,000 jobs, we're going to do a great job. Guess what? She got elected, she did nothing. And the only ones that benefited were the consultants and the people that helped her out. It is a disaster. upstate New York is right now worse than anything you have in the state of Pennsylvania, she did nothing.\nAnd I watched her yesterday, which was hard to do, because she is boring, OK? [applause]\nI watched her yesterday talking about\u2014you know what's funny? I said I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA and they said what happens if you can't make a deal, I said we're going to terminate, we're getting out. And [applause]\nSo I've been saying that and I've been saying we're going to renegotiate different trade deals, and we're going to make great trade deals and all this and she's never said that. All of a sudden, two days ago, I will renegotiate trade deals. She's not going to do it, folks. She's going to renegotiate trade deals the same way she was going to put 200,000 jobs in upstate New York.\nIt turned out to be a total fantasy and I have to tell you, I respect the Washington Post for writing one bad story. Because you what they're doing? And Reince was alluding to it a little bit, the only way she gets elected is if they don't report on her. They don't show her. They have me on so much television. There's CNN, you talk about dishonesty, it's called the Clinton\u2014wait\u2014it's called the Clinton News Network, CNN. Now, think of it, Clinton is[applause]\nShe's hardly ever on. So yesterday, they have yesterday, a scandal with the emails, another one. I'm not talking about the 33,000 emails that she deleted or got rid of. Can you imagine what was on those emails? Can you imagine? I love that. Can you imagine what was on those emails, 33,000 emails were deleted. And she said well it had to do with the wedding and yoga.\nI give two to yoga, I give five to the wedding. I'll tell you, the lies, the deception. We're running like they run right now a third world country folks, OK? You saw what happened, it's running like a third world country, we're being talked about all over the world, nobody can believe it.\nIn fact, when they were going over the charges against Hillary Clinton, one after another after another after another, however, and yet other people, their lives have been destroyed for doing much less, all right?\nTheir lives have been destroyed. So now they have a big scandal in New York. It's in the New York papers, but very little. Pay right? Pay for play. And it's horrifying, it's horrifying. Our government is for sale. Our government is for sale by a crooked person. And what they're doing is they're trying to not talk about her. Take a look. You go to CNN as an example. Story after story about Trump. Story\u2014Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.\nAnd yesterday, it was announced that people are tired of negative\u2014the hit jobs and CNN's starting to do very poorly. That's good. I like that. I like that. And I have to say, Fox has been treating us fairly. Fox has been fair. But CNN has been catastrophic. It's so dishonest.\nBut somebody was explaining to me their theory. If they don't report on her, people aren't going to know how bad she is. Look at her news conference. She hasn't had a news conference in like 260 days. That last one wasn't a news conference. That was a few of her friends. They asked her a question. What did she say about the circuit, right? Let me tell you, if I ever said that, short- circuited, if I ever said I short-circuited, it would be headlines all over the world. They would call for the death penalty. [applause]\nCan you imagine if I said that I short-circuited? I mean, I stand up here for months in front of massive crowds, she gets 300 people going to her events. She gets 300 people and then she reads something from a teleprompter and then she leaves and she goes home and she goes to sleep. [applause]\nAnd then she wakes and she goes again. And I'm telling you\u2014and nobody does anything about it. Now me, I stand up here\u2014I'm not looking at notes. I'm not reading teleprompters. Not easy. Not easy. Not easy. [applause]\nBut\u2014but\u2014remember\u2014but\u2014and if I make one mistake [inaudible] say, he mention something wrong. He got a wrong date. It's like headlines all over. She can say she short-circuited up here. I don't want a president who short-circuits. Is that OK? I don't want it. I don't want a president who short-circuits. [applause]\nWe've got to deal with ISIS. We've got to deal with China. We've got to deal with lots of people. They're not short-circuiting. But I don't want somebody that short-circuits. So let me just tell you\u2014let me just tell you.\nOver the last little while\u2014you know, every time, it's always a big deal. When I said that Obama\u2014and of course, I'm being sarcastic. And they know that because after I said that, I said he's the MVP, he's going to collect his MVP award. OK.\nSo I said Obama is the founder of ISIS. The founder. [applause]\nAnd these dishonest media people\u2014they're the most dishonest people. They said oh, did he mean that? Didn't he mean that? And after that, I'd say a lot\u2014in fact, they like him so much because he's been so weak and so bad. I mean, he let this happen. They had eight states. They had eight countries. They're now in 28 countries. They're expanding.\nSo I said the founder of\u2014obviously, I'm being sarcastic. Then\u2014then\u2014but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you. [applause]\nAnd they all said, he should not say that. They should call him an enabler. Call him an enabler. He's an enabler. I said, that doesn't sound the same. He's an enabler. People are going to say what's\u2014these people are the worst. But listen, so I said the founder of ISIS. And in fact, very soon he's going over to pick up his most valuable player award. Did I say that? I say it all the time. TRUMP: So they knew I was being sarcastic. By now they're analyzing. Did I really mean that? How could I say that? These people are the lowest form of life. I'm telling you. The lowest. [applause]\nThey are the lowest form of humanity. Not all of them. They have about 25 percent that are pretty good, actually. But most of them.\nOK. So, here's the story. So Erie has lost a lot. Right? You know that, right? Hang in, don't leave. I promise we can fix it so fast. We will stop these countries from taking our jobs. We will stop these countries from taking our companies. Hold on.\nOur jobs will come back. Now, I came up with a great plan. I'm lowering corporate taxes so our companies stay, so I don't even have to make the call. The corporate inversions - you know, we have companies that have, they say, two and a half trillion dollars outside of our comp - they can't get their money back. We don't let them.\nEverybody agrees that we should do it. Republicans, Democrats, everybody agrees.\nWhat's the - look, why do we not want them to bring money back? You know why? Because we don't have a president that can sit the leaders of both parties around a table and in about five minutes let them say let's bring this money back in so we can work it in this country, right?\nThat's what it is. So we're going to bring that money back in, we're going to lower taxes, we're going to keep our companies - and if our companies want to leave, they're going to pay a nice big beautiful tax to get their product back in.\nOK? That's what's going to happen. So, the existing U.S. trade deficit with TPP participating nations has already cost Pennsylvania 68,000 jobs, folks. No more, folks.\nWe're not going to be stupid people any more, we're going to be the really, really smart people. It's going to be America first. America first. America first. First. [applause]\nSo, the destruction of manufacturing in Pennsylvania was caused by Hillary Clinton's and her husband's disastrous trade policies.\nI mean, you take a look at what she's done. At the bidding of her corporate funders, Hillary Clinton has backed every job-killing trade deal for decades. She has received so much money, she has approved virtually every tax increase put before her.\nYesterday - you see 1.3 trillion in tax increases. We're the highest taxed nation in the land, essentially. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Anywhere in the world.\nAnd of the industrialized nations, we're far and away the highest taxed nation. And she's proposing a massive tax increase. Folks, we can't do it. It's going to make our country non-competitive - it's already non-competitive.\nIt's going to make our country non-competitive and we're not going to do it. I'm proposing a massive tax decrease for the middle class, for business, and businesses are going to pour in - not since Ronald Reagan has anything like this been proposed.\nBusinesses instead of leaving because their taxes are so high, they're going to stay. I might not even have to make those calls. Now, if I do, I will, meaning my people will. I'll do some, I love doing it. I would love telling some guy you're not moving. Well, Mr. President, sir, we would like to move to Mexico. You're not moving and if you do you pay the 35 percent tax. You say Well, in that case, I'm not moving, I'm not moving. In that case, I'm not moving. So easy.\nSo, your coal industry, your steel industry, which has been ravaged, your General Electrics of the world, which have been ravaged, just ravaged, we're going to end it and I'll tell you why. Over the years, I've watched. For years, for 10 years, for 12 years, for 15 years, beyond Obama, and I've watched as politicians talked about stopping countries from leaving - companies from leaving our states. You need strength, is right.\nOur states. And I watched. Remember they give the low-interest loans? Here's a low-interest loan if you stay in Pennsylvania, here's a zero-interest loan, you don't have to pay, here's a this, here's tax abatement of any kind you want, we'll help your - it doesn't work, folks, that's not what they need. They have money.\nThey want to go out, they want to move to another country and because our politicians are so dumb, they want to sell their product to us and not have any retribution, not have any consequences.\nSo all of that's over and I think you understand it and Hillary can't do it. Number one, she can't do it because the mentality isn't there. She can't do it. No, the mentality.\nYou know, she said fairly recently, I don't like Donald Trump's tone. His tone isn't nice. And I said, here we have a country that's being taken advantage of by every country in the world. Our businesses are being taken. Our jobs being taken. Everything's being taken.\nHere we have a world where ISIS is chopping off the heads of Christians and many others, drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand, and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says, I don't like Donald Trump's tone. [applause]\nFolks, we better get smart, folks. Hey, look, let's see what happens. We better get smart. We better get smart. [applause]\nWe better get smart. We better get tough. And if we're not smart and we're not tough, we're not going to have a country left. And one of the things I have to talk to you about before I leave is our borders. Illegal immigrants are pouring into our country. In fact, I brought something for you people. I brought\u2014I brought\u2014I had to do this. I didn't want to depress you. OK, look. The Clinton legacy.\nNearly one in three manufacturing jobs in Erie, PA\u2014Erie, PA, sound familiar\u2014have been lost since Clinton allowed a certain deal with China to happen. Now, look at this\u2014look at this chart. This is 2001, not long ago. This is now. Congratulations, folks. I hope you're doing well. OK? I hope you're doing well. I don't want to hurt them. I hope you're doing well.\nBut you know what? You can't do well. When you have a government that is so stupid, that is so\u2014that is so incompetent, you can't do it. Here's another one, folks. This is what we're talking about. Syrian refugees\u2014we have no idea who they are, where they're coming from, no paperwork. You saw what happened in San Bernardino. You saw what happened\u2014frankly, take a look at all over the world. Take a look at what's happening.\nIf we don't get smart and we don't get smart fast\u2014Barack Obama is allowing Syrian refugees to come into our country by the thousands. Now, I have as big a heart as anybody in this room and I want to build safe zones and I want, by the way, the Gulf states to pay for it because they've got plenty of money and they're not doing much. OK? We'll supervise it. OPM, other people's money. We'll supervise it, right? We'll supervise it.\nBut they're going to pay for it because we're protecting these people. If it weren't for the United States, those countries wouldn't even exist. They'd be gone. The power we have is so enormous, but we have people that don't know what they're doing. We have an incompetent president. We have people that don't know what they're doing.\nSo look at this. Look at this. Syrian refugees admitted to the United States on a monthly basis. Look what's happening. Look what's happening. [booing]\nNow, in all fairness, we want to help people. Can't take a chance. San Bernardino, they walk in. They start shooting. Paris, the best, the toughest gun laws in the world, Paris, France. They walk in. They kill 130 people. They wound so gravely hundreds of people.\nNow, let me just tell you because well\u2014we're on the Second Amendment, right, Second Amendment. If we had in San Bernardino\u2014if we had in San Bernardino or in Orlando or someplace, somebody in that room like this guy right here, right, or that guy with the blue make America great again hat on or the one with the red make America\u2014or that woman with the beautiful blonde hair. I wish I had hair that looked like that. [applause]\nBut if we had somebody and they happened to have a gun, San Bernardino, they see him come in\u2014first of all, if they knew there was a gun where the bullets would be flying in the other direction, they probably wouldn't have got [inaudible] in, OK? But let's assume they did.\nThe carnage would not have been what the carnage was. We have to protect our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to kill our second amendment. [applause]\nShe wants to kill it. [applause]\nSo here's our chart. And I was thinking about doing a\u2014I bring\u2014every once in a\u2014like, one in ten I do it, you know a lot of these. I love the people. We have such a movement going on. Who likes the snake? Do you know the snake? Do you like it? Who likes the snake? Here we are with this. We know bad things are going to happen. We know as we allow more and more people to come in from these terror areas, bad things are going to happen.\nHas anybody heard the snake? Not that many? Should I do it again? So think of this, folks, think of this, think of it. This is what is going on in our country with our borders. And by the way, we're going to have a strong border, we're going to have a wall, it's going to be a powerful wall that Mexico's going to pay for the wall. [applause]\nAnd we have no choice, and we have no choice. But think of this. This is now a situation where this was written by Al Wilson many years ago and I read it and I said you know that really pertains to what's happening to the United States and it has to do with being fooled, it has to do with a lot of different things but when you're listening to this, think of our border, think of the people that we're letting in by the thousands and Hillary Clinton, you saw those numbers right? With the chart, it's through the roof.\nHillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more coming into our country. How stupid are we? So, are you ready, you ready, you like it, you sure? On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake, his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Oh well, she cried, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you.\nTake me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake, take me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake. She wrapped him up, all cozy, in a curvature of silk. Then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in, had been revived. Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.\nTake me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake. Now she clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried. But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you certainly would have died. Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.\nTake me in oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. I saved you, I saved you, I saved you, cried that woman. And you've bit me, heaven's why. You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die. Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in. [applause]\nGet ready folks, get ready. We're led by stupid people. We're led by leaders and you know honestly, I didn't need this. This I didn't need. I had a nice life, built a great company\u2014a great company, some of the great real estate assets of the world. I may never see them. You know if I win, I may never see them again, and I love them\u2014all over the world.\nBut you know what? This is so important. And I watched what was happening with the Iran deal, and I watched what was happening with jobs, and I watched what was happening with trade where China makes $500 billion in trade deficits with us.\nI look and I saw. Take a look at Mexico. You know, the politicians say, you'll never, ever be able to get Mexico to allow you to build a wall. I say trust me. Now, they don't say that anymore. Now they say, they won't put the money up to build a wall. So easy. Mexico\u2014our trade deficit is massive, massive. They make a fortune off the stupidity of the United Stated.\nMexico will 100 percent\u2014you hear\u2014100 percent pay for the wall, 100 percent. [applause]\nOK? One hundred percent. But the story of the snake is what's happening to our country. We're letting people in. Many of these people hate us. Many of these people don't have good thoughts. And you see what one person can do\u2014one sick wacko can do in Orlando. And then you see his father sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big smile on his face\u2014with a big, fat smile on his face, right?\nAnd he was wearing a red hat, and I said, I hope that's not one of my hats. It wasn't. I was concerned. I saw that hat. I said, I hope it doesn't say make America great again. Bad guy\u2014bad guy. Horrendous son\u2014horrendous son.\nSo here's the story, folks. We have to win\u2014we have to win Pennsylvania, so important. So [applause]\nHillary Clinton is run by people that do this very professionally. They're very good. They keep her out of the spotlight. She doesn't talk to reporters\u2014very rarely. She doesn't do press conferences. She doesn't expose whatever's going on up here. She doesn't\u2014which isn't good. She doesn't expose her mind to questions. And what they want to do is they want to try and fake it through.\nWe need strength. We need toughness. We need a strong temperament. We need a strong tone. At the same time\u2014at the same time, let me tell you\u2014at the same time, we need real, big, beautiful heart because we have to straighten out healthcare. Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced.\nIt's going to repay\u2014did you see\u2014did you see what's happening with Obamacare? Did you see where the numbers are going up 30, 40, and 50 percent? Wait until you see what happens on November 1st. Now, on November 1st, they're trying to delay it.\nBut you're going to get increases, the likes of which probably no country, nobody has ever seen. OK? Anybody in the history of healthcare\u2014in Texas, through going through Blue Cross Blue Shield, they just had almost a 50 percent increase in their premiums.\nAnd the deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by one of those General Electric locomotives and you live for like a long time prior to death, you'll never, ever be able to use your healthcare\u2014the healthcare. Because here's what's happened\u2014here's what's happened. The deductible is so high, you never get to use it.\nSo, you're spending money, your deductibles raises by 17, 18, 19 percent. But now, it's going to go really bad, really bad. It's going to die of its own volition, but we have to kill it first. It's killing our country, it's killing our jobs\u2014it's killing our jobs.\nSo, here's the story, folks\u2014folks. We have to win Pennsylvania. We have to beat this professional group of people that are running her for her own\u2014for their own purposes. We have to win Pennsylvania. We win Pennsylvania, we're going to win it. You know, we're up in Florida. We're doing well in Ohio. And I'm hearing we're doing well here. We'll find out.\nHere's the story... [applause]\nHere's the story. We have to win the state of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. My kids went to school here. We're going to win Pennsylvania.\nIf we win Pennsylvania, I'll tell you what. We are very much on our way. You know, the Republicans do have a tougher path, just so you\u2014not my fault. Not my fault. It's a tougher path.\nFor the presidency, it's just a tougher, winding road. But if win Pennsylvania, we win Florida where we're doing really well, I think we can win Ohio, it'll be over. It'll be over. It'll be over. [applause]\nSo, on November 8th, you have to get out and vote or do some balloting, and I don't care\u2014look, here's the story. If you're not feeling well, if you're so sick, if you go to your doctor and he goes, I'm sorry sir, but you've only got a few weeks left. And it's November 1st. And he gives you the ultimate word, not looking good. You haven't got long left. I don't care and nobody else in this room cares. You have to on November 8th get out of bed and get out and vote, right? Get out and vote. [applause]\nNow, in a lot of cases, you can do your early ballots too. All I'm telling you though\u2014look, folks. I'm just saying your jobs have been taken. Your military and all of the other things, we're going to save your Second Amendment, which is protection, we're going to get of Common Core, you're going to bring your education locally. [applause]\nAll things\u2014I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare. All these things. We're going to take care of our vets. But here's the story, folks. For you people in particular because you have been devastated.\nSupreme Court, he said. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Who did that? Who said that? Thank you.\nBy the way, and I have to just stop for a second. Look, Supreme Court Justice Scalia great. Was supposed to live for a long time. He died. So you have already an empty. This next president could have the most Supreme Court nominations of any president. Could take more justices than\u2014it could be up to five. Probably going to be three, could be four, could be five. OK?\nIf Hillary Clinton gets to put hard-leaning left judges on the Supreme Court, number one, your Second Amendment will be gone. Our country will never ever be the same. We will have problems like we've never had before and you won't have\u2014you will have a whole different deal going, which we don't want, believe me.\nSo, here's the story. If for no other reason, I am going to put\u2014and you know, I've picked through Federalist society\u2014we picked 11 Supreme Court justices. We're going to add probably four more, all vetted through Federalists, through Heritage, highly\u2014I actually got very good marks. We're going to pick these people or people very like that.\nSo, here's the story, here's the story. You ready? We don't win anymore, you people don't win, that's for sure. You just have to look at the statistics for jobs. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win so much that you're going to get sick and tired of winning.\nYou're going to say Mr. President\u2014you're going to send the congressman to see me in Washington. He's going to say, Mr. President, we have to do something. The people of Pennsylvania, and in particular our friends in Erie, they're sick and tired of winning. They can't stand winning so much. Mr. President, we just don't want to win that much. We really want to give other nations like it used to be, where it's good for them and bad for us, at least a little bit.\nAnd I'm going to say\u2014I'm going to say, Mr. Congressman, I don't think you know your people very well, they want to win. And we want to win. And you want to win. And we're going to win. We're going to win so much. We're going to win with our military, we're going to knock the hell out of ISIS. [applause]\nWe're going to win for our vets. We're going to take of our vets. We're going to win at the border, we're going to build a wall, we're going to have Mexico pay, believe me 100 percent. We're going to win with education. We're going to win for our Second Amendment. We're going to win on all of the things we discussed. We're going to win again and you're going to be proud of your country again.\nWe're not going to be the people that are laughed at all over the world for not knowing what we're doing, for allowing others to come in and just strip us of what we have. [applause]\nWe are going to win. We are going to be America first. [applause]\nWe are going to make America great again. And it's going to happen quickly. [applause]\nThank you everybody, thank you. [applause]\n","127":"\nThank you. Thank you very much. [applause] Thank you very much. So amazing. Rudy just left. He just said, \"I don't believe this. This is unbelievable.\" Nobody believes it.\nThe crowds we're getting -- I'm the messenger, but I'll tell you what, the message is the right message. We're tired of incompetence. We're tired of not taking care of our military. We're tired of not taking care of our vets, who are being taken care of very poorly.\nWe're tired of so many different things. And this is what happens. So, our mayor, my friend, Rudy Giuliani just walks, I'm telling you, he said, \"I don't believe this. This is incredible.\"\nAnd what he hasn't seen, and your governor, by the way, who's a great guy.\nAnd he's now seeing it, they're walking outside because there are thousands of people outside that can't get in. I said, \"Rudy, you think this is bad, go take a look outside.\"\nSo I just want to thank Pat and Rudy and I want to thank everybody for being here. And we are going to have a good time. We love North Carolina. We love North Carolina [applause]\nWe did really well in the primaries if you remember, and I hear we are doing really well now. We have to win. That November 8 day is so important.\nYou know, I bring things up like the judges right? Supreme Court Justices, we have to get - you know, you could have as many as four? I guess it's a scenario where this president could pick five Supreme Court Justices.\nAnd if you pick two that are left, left, left, it's going to be a disaster for our country. Your Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association endorsed and they endorsed me early, a long time ago. And they're great people, Wayne and Chris, they are great people. [applause]\nBut if you - if you do something with these - I'll tell you what, Justices right now, you lost a great one with Scalia. We want to replace with Justices very much like Justice Scalia and that's going to happen. It is so important.\nSo if for no other reason, I mean it's such an important - it's one of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that but for a lot of reasons. But that's so obviously, because for whatever reason, they say this could be the presidency. This next four years is where you will pick more Supreme Court Justices than anybody has every had the opportunity to do. Believe me, I'll make you very proud of those Justices everyday. [applause]\nSo we had an incident a few days ago with the $400 million - all cash, right -- $400 million in all cash, anybody know what that looks like? That's a lot of cash. That's a lot of case.\nAnd honestly, it's so sad. Think of it, going to Iran, a terrorist state. Now I happen to think they have plenty of money, we've given then $150 billion, so the $400 million is just, you know - I happen to think it goes into their accounts in Switzerland personally.\nNow, a lot of people say, \"no, no, it's used for terror,\" and they use it for terror because it's the number one terror funder - not even close. But I also think that when you have $400 million in cash, different denominations, do you see the size of this? I guess they did release the pictures after all. They released pictures.\nAnd interesting I'll tell you, I sort of think it goes into bank accounts, right? You know, I sort of think they take it, they probably use some for this, some for that. You can do a lot of things.\nAnd Obama said that he did it because we don't have a working account with Iran. Do you believe that? How long does it take to set up an account? Right? You don't have a working account, you set up an account, right?\nYou set up an account and it takes about - look, what's going on in this country - folks, folks, what's going on in this country is insane. And we have people running our country that don't know what they're doing, they're grossly incompetent, and it's time. We have to make change, real change. Not Obama change, we have to make change.\nWhether it's Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl who was a traitor, and they get five of the greatest killers that they've wanted for eight years. We get Bergdahl -- I call it the five for one trade. For the Iran deal, where we get nothing, we get nothing.\nThey get ultimately, they have the path, beautiful path, they'll get way, way earlier than that. They'll get nuclear weapons, so if you get Trump you're going to see a lot of changes to that deal. That'll happen fast. [applause]\nYou're going to see some big changes and what I really -- I mean, I saw where President Obama said that the $400 million in cash was not, had nothing to do with the release of the hostages, right? It really doesn't work, does it? Does it? I mean, remember Obamacare, \"you're going to keep your doctor, you're going to keep your plan, over and over again, you're going to keep your doctor.\" It was a lie.\nAnd in fact, if he didn't make the lie, he would have never gotten it approved because most Democrats, many of the Democrats didn't want to do it. It was only that, that got them to sign it and to approve it. And it was a lie.\nAnd the $400 million, and from what the rumor is and from what the reports are, the hostages couldn't leave the airport until this other plane arrived. They don't know why, but I think we all have a pretty good reason why. It was all a big lie, it was all a big lie.\nAnd it's so sad to see, and let me tell you, Hillary Clinton is going to be four more years of Obama, but maybe worse. Maybe worse. There'll be four more years. Four more years of ISIS, four more years of high taxes. You know yesterday I had a -- at a big event, really. It turned out to be a very big event in Detroit [applause]\nGood event, very good. And we got wonderful reviews and a lot of good comments. But the thing I'm doing, I'm cutting taxes big league. Especially for the middle class and especially for businesses. Because businesses are dying and that means small businesses, businesses period. [applause]\nBusinesses are leaving our country like they've never left before. They're going all over. They're going to Mexico, that I can tell you. Mexico is like the eighth wonder of the world. You know I've been telling a story, a friend of mine, good friend of mine, good guy. He builds plants, he builds plants for cars, for computers, you know where they make them. Massive plants. And I said to him, how are you doing?\nAnd he's worked in North Carolina, by the way. I said to him, how are you doing? He said phenomenal. He's like, \"I think the biggest in the world at this -\" that's what he does. Great guy. I said how's it all going? He said, 'you've got to see Mexico, Donald. It's the eighth wonder of the world. What we're building there is like, never has been built. We've never seen anything like it\".\nAnd I said, how are we doing in the United States? I'm more interested in that, OK? It's OK I guess. Right? You know, America first, folks. America first. America. [applause]\nRight, America first. [applause]\nAmerica first. We get a little tired of these deals where they actually put, and you know why, because of lobbyists and special interests and people representing and people wanting it to happen. It's just not that they want other countries to benefit over us. There are reasons for it and you know, when I raise money, and I'm putting up a lot of money for my own campaign, I'm funding me.\nAnd I'm raising for the Republican party. And we're getting a lot of money from the small donors.\nRemember two months ago? Well, I hadn't started; I wanted to make sure I get the nomination before I start, right?\nLet me get the nomination, please. And then I took a lot of heat from the press, the world's most dishonest people, by the way. [applause] Terrible. [applause] Terrible. [applause]\nThose cameras will not move and show how many people are in this auditorium. Those cameras -- those cameras are not going on the move unless we have a protester, is there a protester up there in the quota? Any protesters? [laughter]\nIf we had a protester that's the only time they move because they're showing something that in their mind is a bad thing, so then they move. But I like that, I've always liked my protesters because the cameras show these massive crowds and people say wow, was that a big crowd.\nYou know, I go home to my wife, I say how's it going? She says darling, your speech was very good, were there many people there? I say yeah, about 7,000. That's a small group.\nIts only confined -- I mean you had to see outside. I felt so badly -- I came up -- I came up -- thank you and I love you too. Who said that? Who said that, huh? [applause]\nThank you, thank you. But I came up with Rudy from New York and we're driving up and we're going block after block after block the line. And I said are those people going to be able to get in?\nThey said the place is already full. And Rudy just said man; I've never seen anything like that. Maybe a couple of days before an election, but this is what's happening. Because of the fact we have a movement going, folks.\nBecause people are so tired of them. [applause]\nThey're so tired of them. [applause]\nSo -- and by the way -- and by the way, voter ID, watch with that. Watch with voter ID, why aren't we having voter ID? In other words, I wanna vote, here's my identification, I wanna vote, as opposed to somebody coming up and voting 15 times for Hillary. [booing]\nWell -- and I will not tell you to vote 15 times. I will not tell you to do that, OK? [applause]\nYou won't vote 15 times. But people will, they'll vote many times and how that could've happened , it's unbelievable. And the governor just told me that they're going before the United States Supreme Court Justice Roberts and maybe they can get a stay. Let's see what happens, OK? [applause]\nLet's see what happens. That's a very important thing. But I wrote a few things down and to me, so important -- yes, darling thank you. [laughter]\nUnstable Hillary lacks the judgment, now; Bernie Sanders said she lacks judgment, right? And nobody said anything about it, no problem. He said you lack judgment. And -- during one of the debates, nobody said, it was fine.\nWhen I say it they say that's terrible the way you talk. [laughter]\nShe does, she lacks judgment, she lacks temperament and I'm the one that used unfit many, many months ago. And now they've turned it around, use it on me, unfit? I'm unfit? That's -- that's a first. But she lacks the temperament and the moral character to lead this country, its very simple.\nShe really does. She's a dangerous person who doesn't tell the truth which has been proven very loudly.\nI've never seen a -- I don't think we've ever had greater proof of that, of anybody. [applause]\nAnd she has disregarded the lives of Americans -- you see what's happening -- with what she has done with her server? And you know why she did that.\nSo, I just look at this, and I said that if she gets elected, she will cause the destruction of this country from within. Remember that. Remember that. [applause]\nShe will -- she will allow people into our country that will do damage, they will do damage, folks. You look at what's going on in the world -- look at France; take a good look at France. I have friends that go to France. They used to love France.\nThey say, no thank you. They don't expect to be going back anytime for a long time.\nI have one friend, I said, how was your trip this year to France? He said, France isn't France anymore. We're not going. And so many people are saying that.\nLook at what's going on with Germany. Look at what's happening with Germany. Look at the crime; look at the problems. We have enough problems in our country right now. We don't need additional problems, folks. We don't need additional problems. [applause]\nAnd for all we know, this could be the great Trojan Horse. This could be. We don't know who these people are.\nNow, they're coming in through Obama. And I looked at a chart yesterday, and it's like for years, it's sort of like this, a little uptick. And the last number or period of time, it's like, \"Wah, wah, wah, wah.\" There -- I have never seen anything like it.\nThey're letting them in, and again, you can't vet them. You don't know where they come from. We don't know -- look at the damage that two people in San Bernardino, probably radicalized the guy -- the woman coming in. Look at the damage in Orlando. Look at the damage that was done in Orlando by one wack job, one sick wack job. And you know what he was screaming? He's screaming what they all scream.\nAnd we have to get smart, folks. We don't need the problems -- and we've already got those problems, just so you understand. Because they're coming into the country, they're being put where nobody even knows where they are.\nIt's like, if I were the enemy, I would say, I can't believe they're that stupid. They're taking my people and they're putting them all over the place, because you have great military right here.\nAnd our military...[applause]\nOur military cannot be beaten. But you know what could happen? When we don't know where they are, where they're coming, you've them all over the place.\nAnd folks, it's some. You don't need many; you don't need many. One person in Orlando. Two people -- look at in France, 130. Now, they have the strictest gun laws anywhere in the world, France, Paris. One hundred and thirty people killed, 130.\nAnd I've said 100 times, if this man or if this woman, or if that woman or man had a gun in Paris or in San Bernardino and the bullets were flying in the other direction, would have been a whole different story, folks.\nWould have been a whole different. [applause]\nFor those -- for those foolish people that say Second Amendment, would have been a whole different -- and I'd go a step further. If these people, bad people, bad, sick, sick, sick people.\nIf these people knew there were guns in the good guys hands, right, they probably wouldn't have gone in in the first place, all right? All right? Gun free -- what do you think of these gun- free zones?\nDo you know what a gun-free zone is? That's like -- they study where the gun-free zones -- if they would have known you had guns, if they would have known that they were going to be shot at from the other side, it would have been a whole different story. Maybe it wouldn't have even happened in the first place.\nSo they better not come here. They better not. They better not. [applause]\nSo recently a book came out a couple of weeks ago. A Secret Service agent made a statement because she said the other day she short-circuited. Hey, could you imagine if I said that \"I short circuited\"? [laughter]\nThey would be calling for my execution, -- electric chair. They'd bring back the electric chair. It would be a whole different ball game if I said it, believe me. But the Secret Service agent said, \"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office,\" right?\n\"From the bottom of my soul,\" he said, \"I know this to be true. Her leadership style, which is volcanic and impulsive, and she makes bad decisions. OK? Hey, you know, it's one thing to make bad decisions. It's another thing to be wacky and make bad decisions. [laughter and applause]\nShe is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else and she hasn't changed a bit. This is -- that was the good thing. I couldn't say the bad things. It was too much. Nobody would even -- nobody would even believe it. You've got to see this book. Nobody would believe because it's so terrible, so terrible.\nAnd she comes across like this woman -- nice, easy -- but she's not. And -- and she's -- listen -- she's not a leader, not a leader. And she is a liar. [applause]\nHey, hey -- 33,000 e-mails are gone. OK? 33,000 e-mails are gone. They're gone. How do you get rid of 33,000 e-mails? Who sends 33,000 e-mails? I mean, 33 -- do you know how many that is? I think that's like 24 hours a day reading them or sending them, but it wouldn't matter. For years, 33,000 e-mails are missing.\nAnd she's so guilty. She's so guilty. [applause]\nI think it's a tremendous blot in our country. I really mean that. I think what happened over the last two weeks with respect to her, especially in light of the fact that General Petraeus and many others have suffered unbelievable consequences. I think it's a tremendous blot on our country, a tremendous blot. Just remember that.\nBut I just looked at this -- the economic failures of Obama and Clinton, et cetera. Obama-Clinton economic policies have produced 1.2 percent economic growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Now, this is, like, unbelievable -- 1.2.\nDo you know China goes to 7 percent or 8 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. Now, what they do is they cut their currency.\nThey devalue their currency, and big league, and then all of our businesses continue to be drained out of the United States. Our money, our jobs. They make our product, they sell our product to us. No tax, no nothing, you devalue -- see devaluing is sort of cheating.\nYou know, it's sort of like cheating. Now I have great relationships with China. I've done great business with China, I've done really well with China. I have these tenants, I sell condos, I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco with a group, a great group, thank you ma'am. [applause]\nGot to win -- got to win North Carolina. Thank you. [applause]\nThank you. But they -- it's cheating, it's really cheating. And when I look at these trade deals -- it's so sad -- where we lose $800 billion -- billion with B -- dollars a year on trade with China alone, it's $400 billion and $500 billion and $505 billion. This is year in and year out, it's actually amazing that our country keeps going. But what has happened is, we have people in the audience, in 18 years, they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago, in real wages, 18.\nAnd in many cases, they're working two and three jobs, OK? But they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago. And those stats come right out, real wages. They're working harder, they're getting older.\nSo in theory it's supposed to be the other way, you know you work and you're young, you don't care. Get a little older, it's like, oh by the way, how about me? I think I'm working harder too, if you want to know. [applause]\nI never worked this hard in my life. But I like it, I like it, I love it actually because I've met so many incredible people. You know I really got -- thank you -- I really got a tremendous understanding of this country. Because I'm going to places that I've heard about, I've known about, I'm stopping everywhere. And I see the carnage that NAFTA has caused, I see the carnage. It's been horrible. I see upstate New York, I see North Carolina, but I see every state. You look at New England. New England got really whacked. New England got hit.\nYou look at Ohio, what happened there, and still happening. By the way, this isn't like it's going to happen or it's all over, it's getting worse. You look at Ohio, you look at Michigan, what's going on with the car plants being built in Mexico, is unbelievable.\nAnd more and more, you know they're moving. We were just talking about the autoworkers yesterday. Where they've lost over 100,000 autoworkers in Michigan, the state of Michigan, which is our car capital and it's really not the car capital anymore. Mexico will become the new car capital of the world in a very short period of time. No, think of it.\nAnd that's only because we allow it to happen. And I like Mexico. And I respect the leaders of Mexico because they're much smarter, they're much street smarter, but they're much smarter and more cunning than our leaders. But you have to see what's going on. And one of the reasons I won Indiana was Bobby Knight, because he's the best, he's the greatest. [applause]\nBut one of the reasons is that Carrier Air Conditioning let 1,400 people go and they're building a plant in Mexico. And we're not going to let it happen . . .\nIt's a suicidal pact for our country. And you know I've watched for years.\nI was never a politician until 14 months ago. So I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician. [applause]\nCan't believe it. [applause]\nBut -- but I've been watching for years and I've watched as -- as the government tries to keep businesses from leaving our country and going to other countries. And I've seen low interest loans, I've seen zero interest loans, I've seen all sorts of subsidies.\nI get it. That stuff's not gonna work, that's not gonna work. What's gonna work is -- as an example, Carrier moves to Mexico and you wish him a lot of luck, good luck, have a nice plant. I hope my friend bills it, right?\nAnd then you know what happens? When they make their air conditioners -- and then think they're gonna sell that air conditioner, people living in Indianapolis -- where they come from -- for a similar price.\nAnd they think they're gonna sell it there and have no repercussions? With me, they have repercussions, OK? [applause]\nWith me, they have repercussions. [applause]\nWith me, we inform them that if you move, you're gonna pay a 35 percent tax on every single air conditioner that pour across our now very secure borders. [applause]\nAnd two things are gonna happen, one of two things -- one of two things are gonna happen. Number one, if you get them in time, they're not moving. Throws it all off-balance, since they're all off-kilter. Number one they're not -- now, nobody -- people would say well, why doesn't anybody use this? Why doesn't anybody mention it?\nI'll tell you why. Because they're controlled by their lobbyists, they're politicians. And Carrier goes out or whoever it might be this -- I'm just using Carrier as an example. Its hundreds and thousands. Its thousands of company.\nAnd millions of jobs we're talking about. I was looking at numbers -- I'm not gonna repeat the numbers because they'll say I was wrong, it can't be that high, I couldn't believe it was that high. But it's thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobs.\nAnd you'd say why aren't -- like, why doesn't somebody else say what Trump is saying? So I'm controlled by myself because I'm putting up my money, OK? I'm putting up my money. [applause]\nBut...[applause]\nAlthough we raised, did you see $82 million last month, $82 million last month? [applause]\nAnd a lot of it -- a lot of the money was the small donations which Republicans never get. A lot of them -- I think it averaged $61 a hit, $61 can you imagine that? The total that we raised and in fact, in May I told you I was taking heat because they said Donald Trump didn't raise any money.\nAnd they told you why, right? I didn't raise it because I didn't know -- I gotta make sure I got the nomination. If I didn't get the nomination, I would've gone to Turnberry and played golf, OK? [laughter]\nIn Scotland. But you know what? I got the nomination so now I had a start. And we raised $51 million in June, right? A lot of it in small donations and we raised $82 million in July.\nPeople are going, even the haters back there, the people that truly hate Trump -- they said, that's amazing. So we're doing all right. And people look, they want -- they wanna hear this message. Because this is a message this is an important message.\nBut when you say -- and when you hear what I just said -- you charge a tariff or a tax. And guess what? And people said why hasn't the -- why haven't the politicians, they're smart, why haven't they done it?\nBecause they're controlled by people that work for many of these companies and they're not gonna do it. Whether it's donors or whether its special interests or lobbyists they control because they want it to happen.\nAnd honestly, I think it's a total disgrace.\nI think it's a total disgrace for the millions of jobs, and for the thousands and thousands of companies that have left our country. If I were here to speak to every one of those companies for five minutes -- bye, bye.\nThey were so quiet. You know, I like the Hillary protesters. You know why? They're so nice and quiet. The Bernie protesters were brutal; they were tough. Right? The Hillary protesters had no spirit. Did you see that?\nShe starts screaming and the guy walks up, \"I'll go.\" [laughter]\nThe Bernie ones were -- they had a lot more spirit. I think we're going to get a lot of Bernie voters, if you want to know the truth. Because they do understand that trade is killing us. Trade. [applause]\nSo, a few things, a few other facts I wrote, which I think are amazing. One is the 1.2 percent lowest in, you know, forget it. That's not a recovery. It's probably much -- don't forget, when they announced 1.2 percent, that means it's lower. And 1.2 is starting to set records.\nThe national debt -- so, we're up to almost $20 trillion -- $20 trillion! The national debt under Obama has doubled. Think of it, doubled. Might be, I think by the time he gets out, it's going to more than double, but again, we have to very accurate\nBecause I'll say -- they'll say, well, it hasn't quite doubled. Believe me, by the time he gets out it will have more than doubled.\nThe national debt has doubled. And you know the bad part about that? You think if the national debt has doubled, our infrastructure would be great, our country would be in great shape\nWe'd have beautiful roads, beautiful highways. You see where like 50 percent of the bridges are in danger in this country. And the roadways are a mess.\nI have a friend, he's in the trucking business. He said, you know, for years, he had no problem. Now he buys these big, beautiful trucks, and the wheels get wiped out because of the potholes on the highways and things that he never had. So, you think with all of that doubling of the national debt, you'd really think that we'd be in good shape from the infrastructure standpoint, right? We're not. We're in very bad shape.\nU.S. trade deficit, $800 -- almost $800 billion. Nearly 24 million Americans in their prime earning years are out of the labor force, right?\nIn the last seven years, another 14 million people have left the work force. Think of it. These are the real numbers, not the 5 percent nonsense.\nYou know, you look for a job, you can't find your job, you go home, you share, you go to your parents, you go to your friends, you do whatever. You gave up, and now you're considered -- statistically, you're considered employed.\nThose people are not employed; these are great people. And there are plenty of them in here.\nI mean, we have great people. We have the most loyal people. We have the smartest people. You know, so many of my people, they're so smart.\nThey like to say, well, Trump, I don't know if he's got this right -- let me tell you, we have the smartest people. We have the people that are the smartest, and the strongest, and the best and the hardest working. [applause]\nWe have the smartest people. We'll put I.Q.s among -- some of us, we couldn't say all of us, right -- against any I.Q.s that we -- we have to deal with, . . .\nIn the last seven years, 14 million. One in five American households do not have a single member in the workforce. Pretty bad.\nHomeownership -- this is one that is amazing to me -- today, homeownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\nSo you own homes, I mean it always used to be the dream to own a home, right? The American home.\nLowest that its been in so many years, 51 years. Nearly 12 million people and more Americans are dependent on food stamps and 2 million more Latino Americans live in poverty under Obama and Clinton -- under Obama; because Clinton's just gonna carry on.\nYou know, I don't know if you saw. I gave a massive tax decrease yesterday at regulations, we're gonna get rid of so many of them. But Clinton is gonna double your taxes; she's gonna double up your taxes.\nAnd she's trying to say well, I don't know like Trump's way -- she's gonna double up your taxes. You're gonna have massive tax increases is Clinton gets in. Enjoy -- enjoy it folks, if that happens.\nFifty eight percent of African American youth are not employed. How sad is that? American households are earning $4,000 less -- listen to this one, today -- than they were 16 years ago. Many workers are earning less than 1970 in real dollars.\nSo 1970 -- that's a long time ago, right? They're earning in real dollars less money. So under my plan, we're gonna create millions of new and really good paying jobs. You know, it's interesting because even the pro-Obama people say about the jobs that they're bad jobs.\nI've heard it from many of the people. They're trying to defend him. But they say they're bad jobs, they're not good jobs. The good jobs -- the good jobs have left. But we'll create millions of new good paying jobs but good jobs.\nThat's so important, that's so important. [applause]\nEveryone's taxes will go down. Hillary Clinton has supported tax increases on the middle class for her entire career. She's voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. That's all? I thought it was more than that, 235 times. I hope there's not a decimal point in there or so, 23.5 times.\nBut I don't think there is -- voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. Now, she's planning another job killing -- $1.3 trillion tax increase, that's what her tax increase is gonna be, folks. Like you're not paying enough, right?\nHer plan will tax many small business -- businesses who are already in deep trouble out of business. Then we have -- we will make -- and this is so important, this was an Ivanka Trump, OK? My daughter, so great. [applause]\nSo great. [applause]\nWe're gonna make childcare expenses tax deductible for working families. [applause]\nAnd just many, many other things. I mean, we're gonna make some unbelievable changes and it's -- it's so easy. Again, you know regulations -- I'm traveling all over and I'm meeting with business owners -- and beyond business owners, even people that work at the businesses, they're being laid off because of it.\nRegulations; if I told you -- and I'm so surprised, this is probably the biggest surprise -- if you have a small business and I said, you can have one or the other, a major tax cut like we're gonna -- you know, we're bringing it down to 15 percent from more than -- much more than double that.\nBut if I told you that you could have a massive tax decrease or really substantially -- but in a real way -- cut regulations -- a hundred percent of the people I talk to would take the regulation, if you could only have one or the other. It's amazing, its amazing\nAnd that surprised me. Surprised you too? [applause]\nSurprised him, too. [applause]\nA hundred percent. I mean, everybody -- businesses can't form anymore, the tax -- the regulatory burden is so incredible that you can't form businesses -- very hard -- and businesses that are in existence are being put out of existence for regulations that don't do anything. We want safety regulations, we want environmental regulations. We're not, you know, people that don't want these things. We have to have that.\nWe want clear air, we want clean water. We want clear water. But -- but...[applause]\nTo do that -- and there are certain things that you want to do, but to do that, you don't have to destroy our country and destroy our businesses. [applause]\nSo you know, I just wrote this down today. Hillary wants to raise taxes. It's a comparison. I want to lower them. Hillary wants to expand regulations, which she does big league. Can you believe that? I will reduce them very, very substantially. Could be as much as 70, 75 percent. [applause]\nHillary wants to shut down energy production. I want to expand it. [applause]\nLower electric -- lower electric bills, folks. Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick... [booing]\nIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know. But -- but I'll tell you what. That will be a horrible day. If -- if Hillary gets to put her judges -- right now, we're tied. You see what's going on.\nyou see what's going on? We tied because Scalia - this was not suppose to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years at least and this is what happens. That was a horrible thing.\nSo now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Now, speaking to the NRA folks - who are great - when you - when you -- and I'll tell you, they endorsed me. [applause]\nThey endorsed me very early. My son's a member. I'm a member.\nIf you - we can add I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the Justices - they almost go - in a certain way, hand in hand. Now the Justices are going to do things that are so important and we have such great Justices, you saw my list of 11 that have been vetted and respected. [applause]\nAnd have gotten great. And they to a little equate - but if you don't do the right thing, either you're not going to have a Second Amendment or you're not going to have much of it left. And you're not going to be able to protect yourself, which you need\nYou know, when the bad guys burst into your house, they're not looking about into Second Amendments, and, do I have the right to do this? OK, the bad guys aren't going to be giving up their weapons\nBut the good people will say, \"oh, well, that's the law.\" No, no, not going to happen, we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. [applause]\nHillary Clinton wants to have totally open borders where people flow into our country. [booing]\nWhere they flow into our country, and they take your jobs, and they do lots of things. And I want people to come into our country but they have to do it through a process, they have to do it legally, right? [applause]\nSo you have drugs pouring in. You have everything coming in.\nYou know, in New Hampshire, a great state, they have a tremendous heroin problem. I said to them, we will stop the drugs from pouring in to our country from the Southern border. They're going to stop. [applause]\nAnd by the way, we will build a wall. That's legal. [applause]\nWalls do work. Walls do work. [applause]\nNow here's one and you know -- I mean she doesn't look that way, but she is -- Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. That's what she does and look at the mess. So we've spent -- you know for two years, for three years, I've been saying we spent $2 trillion, right, in Iraq, more now, I guess. Somebody actually said to me the other day that they were talking about four or five trillion in the Middle East.\nAnd I'm going to get the accurate number. They don't know the accurate number, the truth is they have no idea. They have no idea what we're doing. We're sending equipment over, the enemies take it in. We sent over 2,300 Humvees that are totally armor plated. They got stolen by the enemy, 2,300. I thought they meant like two or 23.\nOr 230 was too much, 2,300 Humvees and they got stolen. They got taken by the enemy. You know, shot guns fired in the air, the ones we gave to the so-called allies, these great allies that we always pick, who end up being worse than the guys who we're trying to get out. [applause]\nSo, terrible. Hillary and President Obama refused to use the term radical Islamic terrorism. Big problem. Big problem. Hillary wants to release violent criminals and criminal offenders from prison, that's wonderful, enjoy yourselves. I want to work with our police. Our police are so incredible, they're not getting the respect they deserve. [applause]\nNot getting the respect they deserve. [applause]\nAnd we're going to, in our country, restore law and order. We have to, we have to restore law and order. [applause]\nAnd the police are going to be careful and they're going to be studied and they're going to be -- but we have to restore law and order. What happened in Dallas, where all of those people were shot down. Absolutely, absolutely for no reason. Viciously shot down, and so many others. I was with one of the police groups the other day. They're endorsing me.\nOf like, eight other states in the last short while where the same, smaller number, but the same thing was happening where police are being killed. We have to respect and cherish our police. [applause]\nSchool choice we want, common core we don't want. We've got to get rid of common core, bring educational...[applause]\nAnd folks, and we have to re-negotiate with NAFTA. And by the way, going back to the wall, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. That I can tell you. [applause]\nListen, you know these politicians, they don't know me. They don't understand me. And I am, I'm in a group of 50 people, these are real geniuses. These are 50 people that have been running our country forever and they said we can't support Donald Trump. The reason they can't, you know why, because I'm not going to hire these people, I don't want these people.\nTake a look. Take a look at what these people -- these are sort of like the people that have been involved with Washington, making decisions militarily on defense, on other things -- take a look what has happened in our country. Our military is depleted, our vets aren't taken care of.\nWe can't beat ISIS. Can you imagine General George Patton, who is right now spinning in his grave, the great General Douglas MacArthur -- can you imagine -- and I say, because we have so many military people, and this is such a military state and I love it. [applause]\nI love. But can you imagine them seeing that we can't beat these 25 or 30,000 people, we can't beat them? We're fighting a political correct war.\nIt's a political correct war. I mean, you know what's going on. You know what's going on. These are people that chop off heads. These are people that, in steel cages, drop steel cages into the waters and drowned large numbers of people.\nThese are people that buried people in the sand. We've got to knock them out.\nI was against the war in Iraq. We shouldn't have been to the war in Iraq. It destabilized the Middle East and I said that was going to happen. But we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.\nThe way we got out was insane. And Obama gave a date, and he -- and that's how ISIS happened, folks. Hence, the birth of ISIS. [applause]\nCongratulations, Hillary Clinton. Congratulate -- I mean, she -- she should get -- if I'm ISIS, I call her up and I give her the most valuable player award. OK? [applause]\nAnd I guarantee you with Libya, which was her baby, and all of the other mistakes she has made. Obama takes now, because obviously, for him, that's the better alternative, all right? But he has been an incompetent president. He has done a horrible job. [applause] And I guarantee you that if he had it to it again -- and he would only say this to his wife -- but if he had it to do again, he would not have chosen Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state, because she made so many horrible mistakes and cost so many lives.\nAnd I mean lives on both sides. I'm not just saying -- I mean lives on both sides. She's inept; she's inept.\nAnd to think that she is even allowed to run for the presidency of the United States, when she deleted and got rid of 33,000 e-mails is an embarrassment to our country, and it always will be, OK? It always will be. [applause]\nSo -- so, I want to thank all of you for being here. Look, I'm going to be around, and we're going to be coming to North Carolina a lot. Got to win it, very important [applause]\nBut -- the people are great. My daughter-in-law comes from North Carolina. I'm here all the time. [applause]\nBut -- but people -- the people are great. The military is great. We are going to make America great again. [applause]\nWe're going to start winning. We're going to put America first. We're going to make America safe again.\nBut never, ever forget, we are going to make America great again.\nThank you. Thank you, everybody. I'll be back soon. Thank you. God bless you.\n","128":"\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It's wonderful to be in Detroit.\nWe now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It's a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.\nThe City of Detroit Is Where Our Story Begins\nDetroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.\nWhen we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream.\nBut for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.\nWhen we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.\nToday, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average. 40 percent of the city's residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work.\nDetroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime\u2014these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.\nIn short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.\nShe supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community\u2026and the crime policies that have made you less safe\u2026and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets...and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries\u2026 and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.\nShe is the candidate of the past.\nOurs is the campaign of the future.\nThis is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.\nToday, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.\nOur opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.\nIf you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.\nNothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.\nThe one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.\nThat's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.\nMy campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.\nHere is what an America First economic plan looks like.\nFirst, let's talk tax reform.\nTaxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.\nHillary Clinton\u2014who has spent her career voting for tax increases\u2014plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase. Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.\nRecently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again\u2014to use a now famous term\u2014when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.\nI am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.\nThe rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.\nAs part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.\nTax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.\nOur current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.\nMy plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process. We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent. For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.\nWhile we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.\nThese reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.\nWe will Make America Grow Again.\nIn the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family. It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.\nThe State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton's failed leadership. The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton's broken promises. She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator. But what happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: \"upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent\u2026the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation\u2026 Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run\u2026data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton's first term.\"\nCompare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, \"How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,\" the paper writes that I\u2014and this is a direct quote\u2014\"waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out\u2026almost by force of will \u2014 [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\"\nThis is what I want to do for our country\u2014I want to jumpstart America.\nNow let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.\nTheir policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.\nThere are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.\nThe Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.\nHome ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\nNearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office. Another nearly 7 million Americans were added to the ranks of those in poverty.\nWe have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.\n58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.\n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. These are the real unemployment numbers\u2014the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.\nMeanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.\nThe average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.\nThe United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.\nIn other words, we punish companies for making products in America\u2014but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas.\nThis is backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.\nUnder my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business. I am going to cut regulations massively.\nOur lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country\u2014and into cities like Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.\nNo one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.\nMy plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.\nWe are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas. Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.\nFinally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death\u2014it's just plain wrong. We will repeal it.\nNext comes regulatory reform\nAs with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America.\nMotor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.\nIt is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year\u2014that's money taken straight out of cities like yours.\nThe federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more.\nIn 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations\u2014each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy.\nIt is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.\nUpon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.\nI will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.\nNext, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated.\nWe are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. When I am president, we will.\nOne of the most important reforms of all is trade reform\nAs Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. We've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We've seen it in Iran. We've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.\nBut we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit.\nHillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.\nShe supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nLet's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.\nPresident Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion\u2014resulting in some 70,000 jobs.\nLike Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion\u2014more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.\nThe next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed. Her donors will make sure of it.\nA vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP\u2014and it's also a vote for NAFTA.\nOur annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.\nThis is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.\nDetroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.\nHillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015.\nBy far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.\nMichigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members.\nJust imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.\nBecause my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away.\nAt the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.\nChina is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers.\nJust enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States.\nAdd to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.\nTrade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.\nAlso critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform\nThe Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.\nAs a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will \"put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.\"\nWe will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.\nClinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.\nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\nA Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.\nAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:\nIncrease GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;\nIncrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;\nIncrease totaleconomic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.\nThe reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning\nWhen we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.\nWe can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\nAs part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.\nLikewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.\nWe will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order.\nIn the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.\nWe will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide\u2014saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.\nWe also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.\nDetroit\u2014the Motor City\u2014will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.\nOur party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.\nThe other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday\u2014who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.\nThere will be no change under Hillary Clinton\u2014only four more years of Obama.\nBut we are going to look boldly into the future.\nWe will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this nation.\nIt will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy\u2014mined from American sources\u2014that powers this country.\nIt will be American workers who are hired to do the job.\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.\nOur country will reach amazing new heights.\nAll we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.\nWe can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.\nWe can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.\nOnly by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.\nWe need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.\nBefore everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done.\nAmerica is ready to prove the doubters wrong.\nThey want you to think small. I am asking you to think big.\nWe are ready to dream great things for our country once again.\nWe are ready to show the world that America is Back\u2014Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before.\nThank you, and God Bless You.\n","129":"\nSo how good is he? How good is he? [applause]\nSpecial. Special. He is a special man and special person. And he has become my friend. Oh, there is a lot of people here. Whoa. [applause]\nHello, everybody. Your football team is going to have a great year. [applause]\nI watch. I watch. You've got the quarterback, you've got the whole deal. I think it's going to be a very good year. [applause]\nOK? And if you get into that Super Bowl, I will be going, all right?\nSo, you know, I wrote something down before, and I think it is important, because -- I love you too. [applause]\nBecause we need unity, we have to win this election. This is truly one of the most important elections, certainly in my lifetime. Because we are about to go -- we lose it, we are in the wrong direction, and maybe it's gone. Supreme Court justices, always remember that. But so many different levels, and when you see what happened with crooked Hillary today, it was a disaster. [applause]\nA disaster. She had a disaster. She lies folks, she lies badly. [applause]\nSo, I want to -- I just wrote this out. I wanted to say to the group, you know, I had a great time when I was in Wisconsin, and I did not quite eke it out. I thought I was going to, but after that, it worked out well. You built me up, you taught me about politics.\nAnd when I left here, I said, I think I've learned a lot. [applause]\nSo, I love it. I love the people. I have many friends in Wisconsin. And they're -- they're incredible people. You're incredible people, I have to tell you that. [applause]\nAnd we're going to have a lot of fun. We are going to have a lot of fun but I had to write this. This campaign is not about me or any one candidate. It is about America. [applause]\nIt is time for a change. We need a change. A real change, not an Obama change. We don't need an Obama change. We have had enough. It is time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders, and replace it with a government that serves the people. [applause]\nHave to do it. And know both sides. I've been on the other side. Believe me. I actually like this side better; this is a movement. This is a movement like they may be have never seen in this country, according to even the political pundits that truly hate me, OK? This is a -- they -- oh, this is a movement that some say, most say is one of the great phenomenon's that they've ever seen in politics.\nSome say it's the single greatest phenomenon. [applause]\nThough the media doesn't want to talk about it, we have done something -- we. All of us, together. I'm a messenger; I'm only a messenger. We have done something truly historic together, standing before you as nominee for president and I'm not a politician, proudly. [applause]\nI'm not part of the system. I ran against the system, and I'm probably better off running against the system. [applause]\nI ran against the donors. I'm my own donor, essentially. I have a lot of money under this deal. This is a very expensive crisis, I want to tell you. [laughter]\nI funded -- as you know, I funded the primaries. And I'm in for under $60 million, and I'm largely funding my campaign as we go forward. In addition to that -- in addition to that, we have raised tremendous amounts of money, and much of it from small donors,$61; $61. As a Republican, that doesn't happen. It happens because of what you are seeing in front of you today.\nAnd if you remember, just prior to June, they did a story, \"Donald Trump has not really done too well with fund raising.\" Well, that is because I did not even know if I was getting the nomination. I'm not going to raise funds -- I would've had enough if I didn't make it. I would have said, \"Bye, bye, politics.\"\nBut I wanted to make sure -- so I got it. And then I started raising money for the Republican Party. and we raised a lot of money. We started really on June 14th, Flag Day, my birthday. My birthday. [applause]\nAnd in June, we raised approximately -- think of this -- $51 million. Can you imagine? [applause]\nAnd those people couldn't believe it; they were really surprised. Big headlines, you know. Because they don't give me too many good headlines. I could do the greatest things. I do things that I think a fantastic.\nI say, good, there is no way they cover this badly. And they cover it badly. I gently tell a woman that I love her baby, and let the baby cry. It is OK. As the baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti continued to cry -- I remember, I told her to stay, don't worry, ma'am.\nBut after about 3 or 4 minutes, and I'm trying to speak and it was in Jacksonville, we had this massive, massive crowd, filled up the stadium. And the baby's screaming. So, I said, ma'am, I would like to reverse my order. Perhaps you could nicely take -- take the baby out. Your baby is great\nI did it so nicely. She was happy. Even the baby was happy. He stopped crying. [applause]\nAnd maybe you could take the baby out, would that be possible? The whole place was cracking up. And the next day in the newspaper, it said, \"Trump throws baby out of arena.\"\nTerrible. Now, they are very dishonest. That was a tough one, when I -- and I just had a reporter come up to me, backstage, a reporter come up -- \"Mr. Trump, sir, but why did you throw that baby out of the area?\" I said, \"I was having fun. I was so nice, I was so nice. Everybody likes me. The baby liked me, the mother liked me. We had a good time. I try to keep the baby in, but the baby was such -- had such a powerful voice [applause]\nIn fact, I want to find out who that baby is, because I want to sponsor the baby. And that baby will sing someday in Philharmonic Hall. I'm telling you. New York City. OK? The great Philharmonic. [applause]\nSo, I'm not part of the system. I ran against the system. I ran against the donors, because I'm largely my own donor. I'm running against myself. That's sort of -- never thought of it that way. And against the status quo, and the status quo, we have to get rid of, because it is not working, folks, because the country is a mess. [applause]\nAnd that is why put up a lot of money. But while the Democrats nominated the candidate of special interests, and really a candidate of total corruption, I mean, you take a look at what she is doing, the Republicans made history by choosing a nominee from outside of this very, very corrupt the system. It is a corrupt system.\nIt's a corrupt system. You want something done, they can do it for you. And that is not necessarily, and usually it isn't good for the country.\nThat is why we're going to be able to deliver real change, and real safety and real opportunity to all Americans. We have to unite. Remember that.\nEverything I've accomplished, I have done by putting together a really fantastic team, including Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, who has done an incredible... [applause]\nDone an incredible job. My wonderful staff of people that really love what we are doing, and they are working so hard. My family, friends, and it's expanding all the time.\nBut I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make. We have to make them, right? [applause]\nI understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagan's big tent within the party, big, big tent, remember? Ronald Reagan, great man, great guy. Remember he included Reagan Democrats and Independents and Republicans, a lot of people. We're going to have the same thing. There a lot of Democrats perhaps in this room, are there a lot of Democrats? Raise your hands. I mean, I don't think we need too many to be honest with you, but -- so I embraced the wisdom that my 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy, Ronald Reagan. [applause]\nStated by Ronald Reagan, pretty good.\nWe will be the big tent party. We are going to have a lot of cross help. We are going to have a lot of Bernie Sanders people coming in because of trade, because Bernie Sanders knew we were being ripped off by trade. Trade is a disaster with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with Vietnam, with so many countries, with every country, every country.\nWe don't win at any level with anything, and as a unified party, we will lead our country to unity as well, very important. We need the unity, we have to win the election. [applause]\nNo we have to win it --- have to win it. Otherwise, our big movement was not as big as we thought and that's not good. That's why November 8th, you've got to get everybody you know -- and you know, all this voter ID nowadays, a lot of places aren't going to have voter ID. Now what does that mean? What does that mean? You just keep walking in and voting? So you have to be very careful, very vigilant -- you have to be careful\nBut we will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory, and very importantly, toward real change. [applause]\nSo in our shared mission to make America great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. [applause]\nPaul Ryan, he's good. He's a good man. He's a good man and he's a good guy. And we may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree and we're going get it done and we're going to do a lot of wonderful things. [applause]\nHe's a good man. And while I'm at it, I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain for his service to our country, in uniform and in public office, and I fully support and endorse his re-election. Very important. [applause]\nWe'll work together. I also fully support and endorse Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. [applause]\nA state I truly love, primarily because that was my first victory, but I love New Hampshire. No, I love New Hampshire, one of the most beautiful places. She's a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of New Hampshire so very well for a long, long time. Senator Kelly Ayotte. [applause]\nWorking hand-in-hand, we will grow our majority in the House and in the Senate. We need that, we've got to get things done. Arm in arm, we will rescue the nation from the Obama-Clinton disaster, which is exactly what it is, that has bled our country dry and spread terrorism unabated across the world, that's what's happening. You saw it just now, Maps came out yesterday, they said ISIS far bigger, it's all over the place. It's all over the place. We're going to get rid of it, folks. [applause]\nOur military is depleted. We're going to build up our military, we are going to get others with us. Believe me, we're going to get plenty of others with us. And speaking of others, wouldn't it actually be wonderful if we could get along with Russia? Wouldn't that be nice? [applause]\nThey talk so big and so brave and so tough, they're the tough ones. You know, Hillary's real tough, give me a break. Wouldn't that be great? We get along with Russia, we go out together with others and we knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great? [applause]\nTogether we will lead our country back to prosperity, security and peace. OK? When you look at the world and what's happened -- so we have the queen of corruption, she's the queen of corruption. She is a disaster. I said before, if crooked Hillary Clinton becomes president, terrorism will destroy the inner workings of our country. Believe me, they are loving it.\nShe wants to have 550 percent more people coming in from Syria and that region into our nation. And we don't know who they are, we don't know where they come from really, we don't know if they're ISIS, some will be. And look at the damage that's done in San Bernardino with a couple -- probably he became radicalized by her -- a couple, and these were friends of theirs. These were people that gave a party in celebration of the birth of their child and they were gunned down, 14 people killed, many, many injured.\nTake a look at Orlando -- take a look at Orlando, how disgusting that was. Take a look at the World Trade Center and so many other places. Go to the probably toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, go to Paris and take a look at that, 130 people gunned down. You know, if people had guns, on the other side where the bullets are flying in the other direction, like you sir, you sir, you and you, ma'am. [applause]\nFirst of all, if they knew guns were in the room, they probably wouldn't have gone there. There were no guns. They were just sitting ducks, 130 people. In San Bernardino you had 14 people.\nBut in Paris, just like this, boom -- get over here, boom -- get over here, boom -- 130 people with many still in the hospital, many so gravely wounded. It's horrible. And if they had bullets flying in the other direction, maybe they wouldn't have shown up, and if they did, I'll tell you what, you wouldn't have had that kind of carnage. You would have had people lying on the other side of the floor instead. [applause]\nSo Hillary Clinton wants to do major damage, as you know, to our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to put judges -- she wants to put justices of the Supreme Court -- she's going to make them nice and liberal, wait until -- wait until you see what that does to your rights. Wait until you see what that does to your Second Amendment. You will not recognize it, you will not recognize it. National Rifle Association, NRA, endorsed me. [applause]\nThey're great people, Wayne -- they're great people, Chris, they love this country. They endorsed me very early and it's really a -- it's really an honor. I'll tell you what, they are phenomenal people when you get to know them. They love the country -- you know, they love the country. They take a lot of heat, but they love the country, I'll tell you that right now.\nAnd I heard Mike, Governor Pence, talking about 1.2 growth -- 1.2 percent growth, the lowest in memory since the 1940's. When you think about it, it's the lowest. So a lot of differences between all of us, but I thought I would mention -- because I've known Hillary Clinton over the years -- I know her -- and she makes statements. She makes statements and they are statements coming out of her playbook.\nWell, let's see, \"we can't get them for this -- can't get them for this.\" I've always heard that I have the best temperament, people tell me I have the best temperament, I have a temperament to win. We got to win. We got to win[applause]\nShe said not so long ago, \"I don't like Donald Trump's tone\". Now, she is reading it off teleprompters only. \"I don't like Donald trump's tone.\" And I said, you know, \"we need a tough tone today. We have people -- we need a kind tone, but we need a tough tone.\"\nWe have people being beheaded all over the Middle East and other places. We have crime that is rampant. We have people in the Middle East being drowned in steel cages. This is like medieval times, and she is worried about my tone.\nSo they chop off heads and they drown people, and they bury people in sand. And then they ask me, \"Mr. Trump, sir,\" -- at one of the debates in which I won, I'm very happy about that -- \"Mr. Trump, sir, how do you feel about waterboarding?\" I'm seeing chopped off heads, drowned people, burying in sand -- I said, \"I'm absolutely OK with it, let me tell you.\" [applause]\nCan you imagine what the enemy must say -- can you imagine the enemy -- ISIS in this case -- can you imagine what they must say as they spent the day chopping off the heads of Christians -- \"come back, get together and start talking -- and they say waterboarding is not allowed in the United States -- by the United States, waterboarding is not allowed.\"\nFolks, we better get smart and tough and we are playing games with Hillary, we are playing games. It is just games, she is not the right person and everybody knows it. Her single greatest achievement is being caught in a crime and getting away with it. [applause]\nThis is true, 33,000 e-mails. [applause]\nSo I wrote this before on the way over to another rally at also a very nice place that's very full and very nice in Iowa. And we love Iowa don't we, yes? Right? [applause]\nI thought it was accurate, unstable -- and she is, she is unstable. Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment that Bernie Sanders had. You just have to pay attention, as soon as he said it, I started writing notes. [applause]\n\"She has bad judgment. She lacks the judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country. Plus, she is a weak person.\" We don't need a weak person. He just said, \"plus, she is a criminal.\"\nShe is a dangerous liar who has disregarded the lives of Americans, and who has put all of us at great risk while supporting economic policies that have destroyed our economy. We have a long way to go.\nShe is unhinged, she's truly unhinged, and she is unbalanced, totally unbalanced. And you can see, in the words of a secret service agent who just wrote a book, I bought the book, I wanted to see what he had to say; \"she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.\"\n\"From my bottom of my soul\" he said, \"I know this to be true.\" He was there. \"Her leadership style, volcanic impulsive as it is, disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasn't changed a bit. She's unqualified to become president.\" And she really is, and Bernie said that too. [applause]\nThank you. What great people. Wow.\nNo, but it is true, no games, it is true. In one way she is a monster, OK? Look at what happened, look at her history. In another way, she is a weak person, she is actually not strong enough to be president. So she's got both, but she is not strong enough to be president.\nShe will be a be a disaster. She will be so bad for our country, and I'm not just talking about Justices of the Supreme Court. She will be so bad for our country and we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen.\nYou know, Mike Pence told me a story, and maybe I should not say it, but I found it interesting, but of the reasons -- I guess the primary reason that he's in politics is because he watched the crookedness of the Clintons when they were in the White House. And he said \"he ran, he ran again and he ran again, and he won.\" You have to hand it to him, this is the guy that does not give up. He does not quit. He never ever quits. [applause]\nBut he watched the Clintons -- and I'm sure they will be thrilled to hear that -- but that actually got him into politics, which is interesting.\nSo then we make these horrible deals; Iran Deal, horrible deal, we got $150 billion -- and how about $400 million -- think of it, $400 million in cash, different currencies, different denominations. Now, lot of people say that money went toward terror\nI'm nicer than that, see, I don't have that horrible thought process that some people have in this room have. I say, some of it went to terror, but a lot of it went into their bank accounts, believe me, that's the way it is. It went into their pockets, can you imagine these guys sitting there with $400 million in cash? You think they're giving that money to terror, they are giving that money to them and I guess terror got some of it, but most of it they kept.\nI mean, the concept of paying $400 million in cash is mind- boggling. I mean, you wouldn't think -- who can authorize such a thing? Where did they get it? What did they do, go to a bank teller and say, \"give me $400 million in cash? I want to in euros, I want it in Swiss francs, wrap it up, we will come back in 10 minutes.\"\nI mean, it is just inconceivable. So we are witnessing a horror show in this country and throughout the world. You look at what is going on throughout the world with these same people, these people funding terror -- these people are funding terrorism. For us to have given $400 million to basically free our hostages.\nNow, Obama, just like he lied about Obamacare which was a tremendous lie, that was a tremendous lie, remember? \"You can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor.\" Really? How many people have been able to keep the doctor or their plan?\nKeep your plan, keep your doctor -- not working that way, folks. It is a disaster. By the way, it is going to be repealed and replaced 100 percent. [applause]\nAnd -- and honestly, I hope I win, because we will do a great job. We are going to make America great again. We're going to make America great again. [applause]\nBut I actually think that regardless of who wins, Obamacare is going to fold in any event. It is so expensive. People can't afford it and the country can't afford it. Other than that, it is just wonderful. So, in Texas, they just had almost a 60 percent increase. Now the increases are starting to come out. The big increase is going to be announced on November 1st. The election is November 8th. Folks, they want to delay it, because it is election-changing. It is a mess.\nIt is election changing, and they want to change it. And we can't let that happen.\nBecause the numbers -- and I can see some of the numbers already -- the numbers are going to be astronomical. They are going to be astronomical. They're going to be so big, so horrible, and the health care, you know, the plan is terrible. It's terrible. And we're going to take care of everybody, but we're going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country.\nThis plan is a total rip. It does not work, so it's going to fall, because economically, it is a disaster for the country, too.\nBut what about people where they said they had a 30, 40, 50, 60 percent increase? And it's going to be worse than that, I predict on November 1st.\nSo, we'd better get smart and we'd better start thinking properly.\nNow, I want to talk about what is going on at the borders, because money... [applause]\nOh, we're going to build it.\nSo, listen, so we have people coming to our country that should not be coming to our country . We have thousands and thousands of people from certain terrorist states, from certain parts of the world that we are allowing to come into our country.\nMost of the politicians, almost all of them don't even know where they are, where they are being put, they know nothing about these people. This could be the great Trojan Horse of all time. And Hillary wants thousands more to come in over and above Obama. Right?\nSo, tall -- and the wall is getting taller every day. [applause]\nIf you think of this, I just wrote this, the Obama-Clinton foreign-policy has handed huge portions of Iraq, Libya and Syria to ISIS. Huge portions. It has undermined stability in Egypt, and you know what they have to do over there. And empowered Iran as never before. Iran, three years ago was -- was dying. In fact, when they were marching in the streets, if Obama would have just encouraged them a little more, it would have been taken over by the people.\nBut Obama played ball with the thugs that are running it right now. Think of this, think of this. Look, look. We're making a deal, and the deal is not made, and they are dancing in the streets of Iran saying how stupid the Americans are to be making this deal.\nThe leaders, and in particular the leader of Iran, is calling us stupid, and the deal means nothing.\nAnd yesterday, I think he just said that the United States is essentially nothing.\nThis is our -- this is our great, great partner.\nBut when you have somebody -- if I was making this deal, and if the other side was bragging about it, the deal wasn't made, I'm not making that deal. I'm not making it. I'm walking.\nBut we kept it going, and we should have never ever started negotiating that deal until we had our hostages back. OK? [applause]\nWe should have walked. We should have doubled up the sanctions and walked. And they would have -- and I say it. Before the plane reached New York City or Washington, you could just turn it around, because they'll call you, they'll say, let's go. Take your hostages.\nBut when you think about it, you probably read today and yesterday, one of the hostages was waiting for a very long period of time. Now, Obama said that it had nothing to do with the hostages. That he would not do that for kidnappers.\nHe would not do that for kidnapping. OK? No, no, think of that. You have got to think about it. He wouldn't do it -- now, it was the same day, right, same day. We have to be exactly accurate, because they'll catch us, right? Same day.\nThe money came in, and one of the hostages, a good guy, I saw him interview on television. Good guy, hard time. Btu didn't he say he waited forever, he waited. And somebody said, nope, we are waiting for either something or a plane to come in.\nAnd here Obama stands up yesterday, and for seven minutes is telling us one thing had nothing to do with the other. Just a lie. You know, at least be truthful. [applause]\nAnd we're talking about the same day, $400 million, and we could have had something that would have been a much better deal. And you know what, I'm all in favor of deals when it gets to nuclear. But we could have made it -- we should have walked. And we should have walked with $150, too; we have said, sorry, we don't have the money, can't pay. We don't have the money. We owe almost $20 trillion\nI'm sorry, fellas, we love you, we think you're the greatest guys on Earth. But we can't give you the money. We don't have it. And they will get angry and they will be upset, and two days later, you'll be back negotiating.\nYou just saved yourself $150 billion, right? Hundred and -- $150 billion. [applause]\nSo, we have terrorists pouring into our country, we have people coming in. I don't know if you saw this, in Maine -- and Maine knows, because Maine is -- I was up there yesterday -- a great place. A great governor, great governor. Paul is doing a great job.\nAnd I think the most important issue facing civilization right now is radical Islamic terrorism. And we have a president that refuses to use the term, and we have crooked Hillary who does not want to use it. Now, she's being forced to use it by me.\nDid you notice she gave a speech, she said, I will use it. She called it, I think, radical Islam. But she said, I will use it. I will. Just like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She called it the gold standard. It is a horror show.\nIt's almost as bad or maybe it's going to worse than NAFTA, signed by her husband, which cleaned out many of the states in our country, cleaned them out from manufacturing. Moved to Mexico and other places. NAFTA, a total disaster.\nNAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton. He never suffered the ravages, because he signed it, then he got out and other people did suffer with it.\nBut we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, and if they don't want to make a great deal for us so we get our jobs back, at least a lot of them, if we can't make a great deal -- and she can't do that, by the way, if she wanted to.\nNumber one, her donors would not let her. Her special interests would never let her. Her lobbyists would never let her.\nNumber three, she could not do it anyway. Even if she wanted to.\nBut we're going to renegotiate. And did you hear her the other day? After years of saying how wonderful it is, even though you look at New England, and you look at New York state and you look at Pennsylvania and Ohio, if you look at a lot of other places, one of the reasons I won Indiana so big -- well, one of the reasons was the great Bobby Knight, OK?\nBobby Knight in Indiana. [applause]\nThat's gold standard right? As she said about TPP. But one of the reasons I won was because Carrier Air Conditioning was moving to Mexico from Indiana, and they let go of 1,400 people.\nAnd I've been talking about this, and I know how to stop it, and you've heard me before, so easy to stop. There have to be consequences when Mexico takes our companies. And not only Mexico; there have to be consequences when China devalues its currency so that our companies can no longer compete with China, even though we make better product.\nI have friends who are manufacturers. We make better product. They can't get their product into China And when a few times arise where they can, they have to pay an incredible tax, beyond what anybody would even think costs. But yet, we open our doors and just throw away your stuff, and we lose our jobs and it is very, very said.\nBut look, as many know, a major destination -- Maine, has become a major destination for Somali refugees. We admit hundreds of thousands of refugees into the United States from many of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world. And you are getting them here too folks, you just don't know it because you just don't know.\nAnybody in this room -- anybody in this room from a terror territory? All right, a practice -- and this is a practice which will continue under Hillary Clinton except it will expand five, six, seven fold. I don't get it. I mean, I know they will vote Democrat, OK, that's what I know, but they will not be voting for a long time.\nI just -- I don't get it, how can anybody even think this way? Now, the Washington Times reported, \"of the Somali refugees -- the program in Minnesota -- that the effort to resettle large groups of Somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state safety net\" -- tremendous problems for safety -- \"and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for the Islamic terror groups\nAren't we smart? We are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs. Here are some of the examples -- I will give you a few examples, and this came out of the Senate subcommittee just recently. \"The Boston bombers\" -- remember those horrible, disgusting people? \"The Boston bombers arrived through the political asylum process.\nThe younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on September 11, 2012. The older brother had a pending application for citizenship.\" And look what happened, we took them in. Look what happened, aren't we smart?\nThe Moroccan national who came to the United States on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university in a federal courthouse. Great. A Uzbek refugee living in Idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror recruits how to build massive and very dangerous bombs. We let him in.\nAn immigrant from Syria who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers, execution style if possible -- more than that, if at all possible.\nA college student who immigrated from Somalia who later applied and received U.S. citizenship, attempted to blow up a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Oregon.\nAn immigrant from Afghanistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship, and a legal permanent resident from the Philippines were convicted for plotting to join Al Qaida and the Taliban in order to kill as many Americans as possible -- as many as possible.\nAn Iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to ISIS, his travels to Syria, and how many Americans he wanted to kill.\nTwo immigrants from Pakistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for plotting to detonate a bomb -- and a very big bomb, in the middle of New York City.\nAn immigrant from Yemen who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for trying to join ISIS. He was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms to try to shoot as many American military personnel as possible.\nAll right folks. So, I just say, what are we doing? What are we doing? And Hillary Clinton wants more and more to pour in. You can almost say, you know, politics aside, whether you are a Democrat, whether you are a liberal, a Republican, a conservative; what are they doing? I don't care who you are, what the hell are they doing? [applause]\nSo we are going to have strong borders, our southern border is going to be very powerful. We are going to stop the drugs from pouring into Wisconsin and every place else. [applause]\nThe heroin epidemic is beyond belief. In New Hampshire, a great place, that is where I realized the extent of what is going on. I met with the people of New Hampshire and they tell me, \"the biggest problem they have is heroin.\" I said, \"it can't be with the beautiful lakes and streams, it so beautiful.\" Right, and their biggest problems heroin. I said, \"you have to be kidding, that can't be right, \" and it was. Their youth is being poisoned. And then you go to Massachusetts, and you go to North Carolina, and South Carolina, and you come here, you come here -- I just left Iowa, you go to Iowa and you see the tremendous problems they have with heroin and drugs that pour in from the southern border. And look, here's the story, we are going to have strong borders. We are going to have a wall, it will be a big and powerful wall -- a big powerful wall. [applause]\nYou know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall a number of years ago? She wanted a wall. And the primary research, as we understand it, looking back, not that long ago, she wanted a wall. You know, walls do work folks, all you have to do is ask Israel. All you have to do is ask some of the nations that are in Europe right now that are building walls.\nYou know, it's sort of interesting, Obama talks about, \"there will be no wall.\" But in the White House, which he just said, which is true, they want to build essentially a wall, they want to build a fence a lot bigger, and a lot higher, and a lot stronger.\nYou know, it is interesting. I say, \"don't build that fence right, don't build that fence,\" because they say, \"walls don't work\" -- fences don't work, don't build that fence.\"\nWhen Hillary doesn't want to let you have your guns, she is surrounded by people like this that have more firepower on them than any human beings on earth, and I think she doesn't want to have guns. I think that all of her bodyguards and all of her Secret Service should immediately give up their weapons. [applause]\nOK, I mean it. They should immediately give up their weapons. They should immediately give up those weapons and if somebody comes at you with a gun, you just try to talk them out of it, I guess. You got to do some quick talking.\nYou got to do some quick talking, Hillary. I don't think even Hillary with her phony lies and disgusting habits, I don't think Hillary could get away with that one. [applause]\nSo we are going to have a little contrast. And I did this very quickly but it is so simple, Hillary wants to raise taxes, Trump is going to lower taxes very substantially, the biggest tax decrease of all on business and on person.\nHillary wants to significantly expand regulations.[booing] Trump is going to get rid of many, many, many regulations. [applause]\nWhich, by the way, are stopping your businesses both small and big from succeeding, from expanding and more than anything, from starting. You can't start a business today the regulations are so onerous and horrible.\nHillary wants to shut down energy production. [booing] Trump wants to expand it significantly. And we'll start paying off our debt. [applause]\nHillary wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment, take away your right. [booing] Donald Trump will protect it more so than any president that has ever served. [applause]\nCrooked Hillary wants far left activities judges forced over there by Bernie and by Pocahontas. [laughter]\nWho will destroy our Constitution. I want judges who will support and defend our Constitution. [applause]\nAs close, by the way, to Justice Scalia who was great as we could get, OK? [applause]\nHillary wants to open our borders, just open them up because her special interests and donors want it that way. There are reasons, I understand that. I want to totally secure our borders. But I want people to come in. But they come in through a process and they come in legally. [applause]\nHillary wants to invade foreign countries. You ever see the one where she says \"Donald Trump with the nuclear\" -- I'm -- I didn't want the war in Iraq. And I'm on record. I didn't want the war in Iraq. I didn't want all of -- what they've done. And I said, if you read Esquire Magazine from a long time ago, you'll see everything I said was exactly right. It's going to de-stabilize the Middle East.\nI said the meanest, toughest group of people, the people that hate the United States and its people the most, they're going to take it over. That's exactly what's happening. They're taking over the oil, they're taking over the land, they're taking over everything. I didn't want it, but I'm always being accused like the war hog they think I'm a tough guy, the war hog. Right?\nThey think she wants to be tough with Russia. So she said well, Donald Trump likes Putin. I don't know Putin, folks. I don't know. I hope I like him, I hope he likes me because I'd love to get along with Russia. OK? [applause]\nLove to. But I don't know. But she goes Donald Trump, Donald Trump -- think about it -- wants to befriend Putin and other things, she said right? And I'm saying to myself what's wrong with that? That's good.\nBut she's going to be the tough one, see? She's going to be the tough one. She's going to play with nuclear weapons, you know? They have all the nukes, nice nukes. She's going to be the tough one.\nI'll tell you what, you put her in the office of the president -- you know, she hates Putin and Putin hates her, right? That's what I hear. No, no -- Putin probably doesn't respect her more than anything else. But Putin hates her. But she's going to be tough. We're going to be tough with Russia -- oh, we're going to be tough, right? Let me tell you, we're in a different world today, folks. We're in a different world.\nBut she makes it sound like I'm this tough guy that will have a temperament. You know, she uses the word -- you know who gave her the word? Her people that write the speeches, we'll say Trump with a temperament.\nThey said Trump in a speech with tweets. I've got -- I've got between Facebook and Twitter like almost 21, 22 million people. It's an asset, it's an asset. I tweet well. But -- but she said -- she made the statement during her speech, you know, I heard it barely because I was falling asleep, you couldn't watch it. [laughter]\nAll right. So remember that one. Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. Look at Libya. Look at that. We did a great job there. You know, a spot hit on Gaddafi maybe, but I mean even that, what the hell do we get out of this? It's a disaster. Then you have Benghazi, then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS taking over the oil, large portions of the oil. And it's some of the finest oil in the world. And you have ISIS grabbing it.\nWe don't know what we're doing. We have people that don't know what we're doing. We have people that militarily -- in fact, they said well, who is your military consultants? And I give them names. But they're not working now, you know they're not working now. And I said of course they're not working now, look what working now people have gotten us. Havoc, who the hell wants the people who are working now? I mean... [applause]\nYou know, a lot of it's common sense and a lot of it's instinct and she has very bad judgment, she's got no instinct whatsoever. And when I was asked on one of the big networks about NATO, they said what do you think of NATO? Now, you know it's not like it was my primary subject in all fairness. I've only been doing this for 12 months. Now, it's actually almost 14 months, hard to believe, right?\nBut NATO -- so I said I know enough. And sometimes knowing a little is better than knowing too much. You understand, you can't see the forest through the trees, right? So I said NATO in my opinion is obsolete because it's not covering terrorism. Obsolete for that reason and also you have many countries that aren't paying their fair share, they're not paying what they're supposed to be paying. [applause]\nAnd we're protecting those guys and we're supposed to get into World War III for all these countries that aren't paying their fair share. And even the commander of NATO -- and I so respect what he did. He came out the other day and he said Donald Trump is right, we have cut you see that's right did you see the letter -- the big story? Donald Trump is right. I'm sure Obama was thrilled when he saw that. [laughter]\nDonald Trump is right; you have countries that aren't paying. And he said how he goes in and he talks to them. He says look, you've got to pay your bills. I have budgets -- which is true. And I have to go back to Congress and I have to say what's happening.\nThey don't pay their bills though because people don't ask properly. And they probably say to the president or whoever may handle the country. \"Sir, we owe the United States millions of dollars. We're ready to pay.\" Oh, have they asked for the money? No. They'll pay, OK\nBut I will say the commander of NATO said I was right. And then you have these people back here -- stupid people -- right here. They said Donald Trump -- now they're the worst. They're the worst. They said Donald Trump -- Donald Trump doesn't like NATO. He is going to abandon NATO. That's not what I said. I said they've got to pay. They've got to pay.\nNow, you have to walk. You may have to walk. But they've got to pay. We're going to get in World War III for all these countries that are laughing at the stupidity of the United States, right? No, they've got to pay. And they probably will, in all fairness.\nBut Hillary said about Japan -- because Japan, we're defending Japan you know that, right? Now, in all fairness before I came alone put yourself back three years ago. Did anybody know that we defend Japan? Raise your hand who knew. All right, there's about 12 percent.\nNot bad. I think some of you are lying, OK? I think some of you are related to Hillary Rodham Clinton. I think some of you are lying. But we defend Japan and a man comes up, general or something, a few months ago, I remember so vividly. And he said at a news conference because they were embarrassed because I kept saying they've got to pay their way. And if they don't -- if they don't, you always have to be prepared to walk you have to do that.\nYou know, we don't want to do that, I understand the reason. It'd be nice to have them but you know this isn't again 40 years ago. We owe $20 trillion. We're defending all these -- we defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend Saudi Arabia. You think they have the money to pay -- how about we have military bases that we rent -- we pay rent to Saudi Arabia to protect them? No. No, think of it. Think of it, think of the stupidity. Think of the stupidity. So this general comes up, has a news conference a few months ago. And he said, \"Mr. Trump doesn't understand that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend them.\"\nSo a reporter goes up who I think is there and said to me, \"Mr. Trump, we'd like your comment. They say that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend.\" And I said why aren't they paying 100 percent? The reporter said, OK.\" Not a bad question. Now, here's the problem with the Hillary -- Hillary rotten Clinton. Here's the problem. [applause]\nHere is -- that's why she changed her last -- that's why she doesn't want to use the name anymore, because everybody was saying that. I don't know. I've been saying it.\nBut look, here is -- here is why it doesn't work for Hillary. She saw that I said that we have to get reimbursed for our costs, at least, right?\nJapan, economic behemoth. Germany -- see how well they're doing -- economic behemoth. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.\nThey were making $1 billion a day with their high oil prices, now they're making a fortune, the same thing. Economic behemoth. Why are defending them, and why aren't we being fully reimbursed? Now, if we do that, your budget already is starting to look real good, OK. You know, you have budgets, so we losing our assurance; we have an $800 billion trade deficit, folks.\nWe trade with companies. We have a deficit with other countries, think of it -- $800 billion a year. Trade deficit. Do we make the deals? no.\nWith China, $505 billion trade deficit. And they cheat us because they devalue their currency all the time. Whenever it gets a little bit tough, devalue, devalue, and our companies can't compete with that. Right?\nSo, here's the thing. So, Hillary says about Japan, how dare he not not stay with our allies, how dare he not do that?\nI will never abandon our allies, ever, ever, ever. Now, how do you negotiate when you're telling somebody will never going to leave? We may have to leave.\nLook, Japan has problems because you have the maniac in North Korea making missiles. But I mean, you know, so we'll get it.\nNow, South Korea, it is an economic behemoth. You can't buy television that is not made in South Korea, except Sony, which is made in Japan, which has sort of lost its way. Whether it is LG or Samsung. I order thousands of television sets; you can't buy them in the United States. I'd love to. Show me one company. One of the pundits said, they do make them. There's a company.\nAnd he showed me, it's a little company. What they do is, all the parts come in for -- from all over the world; they put them together, and they give you a television that doesn't work and nobody ever heard of it. [applause]\nAnd then I put it into a luxury hotel, and everybody complains, right?\nSo, you can't say to people when you're negotiating -- because we're talking about tremendous billions and billions of dollars. You can't say to people -- you can't say to people when you're negotiating, we'll never leave you.\nThink of this, we're going to never leave you; we love you, we'll never leave you. Could you pay more? No, we're not going to pay anymore. You're not going to leave us. Why should we pay more?\nSo, there's a chance we'll have to leave. And there's a chance that, you know, Japan will have to take over this monster and figure it out. We're very far away. It's very expensive.\nYou know, we have a treaty with Japan. And if the United States is attacked, they don't have to do anything. But if Japan is attacked, we have to go in there will our full force and might, and who the hell knows what's going to happen, right\nWorld War III, who knows what's going to happen. But if we're attacked, they don't have to do anything. You tell me, who makes these deals?\nIt's like Sergeant Bergdahl, right? So, we trade a dirty, rotten traitor where five or maybe even six people were killed when he deserted, and we knew that they were killed and we knew that he was a traitor. We trade for five of the greatest killers, the greatest killers in the Middle East, the five people that they wanted the most. That is our deal.\nSo, we get a traitor and they get five people that are right now, most of them, already back on the battlefields trying to kill everybody, including us.\nNo more, folks. That is called the five for one president. That's -- that is the same guy that made the deal for $400 million. The other guys couldn't leave the airport, the hostages. And then all of a sudden, they were able to leave.\nAnd then you watched him yesterday saying that, can you believe it? This had nothing to do with that. OK? Just a coincidence. No, no, just a coincidence -- no. You know, she is unfit to serve as president for a lot of reasons. He is unfit also. He has done so bad. He has been so incompetent. We have doubled our debt during his -- think of it. Over the years of our country -- over the years of our country, he gets in, and in eight years by the time his term is up, we will have doubled our national debt.\nThink of it. So, we have to win this election. This is a very important election. I do not need to do this, folks, believe me. I could be elsewhere right now, I love being with you.\nBut I could be elsewhere. I could be -- I might be in Wisconsin, just a different location. OK? But I felt I had to do it. I want to give back. I will get back give back, I'm going to give back. I'm going to give back. [applause]\nI want to give back. Because our country does not win anymore.\nOur country does not win anymore. And it is not going to win with crooked Hillary Clinton. Not going to win. It's not going to win. She does not know how to win. Our country is not going to win with her.\nWe're going to be worse than we are with Obama. I mean, if you want four more years of what is going on, ISIS, all over the place, ISIS expanding.\nAnd by the way, our policeman are great, great people. [applause]\nAnd we are not going to allow our policeman to be shot down anymore. Anymore. No more. No more.\nSo, November 8th, you have a big election. I promise you this, if I win, we're going to start winning again. We are going to win on trade, we're going to win with our military, we're going to take out ISIS, we are going to win for our veterans who have been totally mistreated.\nOur veterans are great. We have a great plan for the veterans. We're are going to win for our veterans, first time, maybe ever.\nWe are going to win on trade deals. We are going to make the finest, we are going to bring our jobs back. We're not going to make it easy for these companies to leave and fire everybody. It going to be very, very expensive when they do it.\nBelieve me, it's going to be very, very expensive. They're going to say, you know what? Maybe we'll stay Wisconsin, OK? Maybe we will stay. [applause]\nNo, it's going to be very, very hard. We're going to have strong borders, we're going to have the wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall 100 percent, 100 percent. [applause]\nWe are going to get rid of Obamacare. We're going to get rid of Common Core, we're going to bring our education -- local. We're going to have local education.\nWe're going to appoint great Supreme Court justices. [applause]\nAnd folks, we're going to start winning again. We're going to win at every level. We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning, I'm telling you.\nYou're going to be begging me, Mr. President -- you will send your great quarterback, right? He will come to the White House. Everybody respects him. He'll come to the White House, and he'll say, Mr. President, the people of Wisconsin, they can't stand winning so much. [applause]\nCould you tone it down just a little bit? I will say, I just can't do that. We are going to win more, and more and more, we're going to win at every level.\nBut we are going to win. We are going to make America great again. We're going to make America safe again.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.\n","130":"\nThank you all very, very much! Thank you for that amazing welcome!\nThank you all for the great convention that we've had.\nAnd Chelsea, thank you. I am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become. Thank you for bringing Mark into our family and Charlotte and Aidan into the world.\nAnd Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago ... it is still going strong.\nYou know, that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy and hard times that tested us. And I've even gotten a few words in along the way.\nOn Tuesday night I was so happy to see that my \"explainer in chief\" is still on the job.\nI'm also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime.\nTo all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight and to those of you who joined this campaign this week, thank you. What a remarkable week it's been!\nWe heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton, and the man of hope, Barack Obama. America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership. And I'm better because of his friendship.\nWe heard from our terrific vice president, the one and only Joe Biden.\nHe spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people as only he can do.\nAnd first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching. And the president we elect is going to be their president, too.\nAnd for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him from city council and mayor to governor and now senator. And he will make our whole country proud as our vice president.\nAnd I want to thank Bernie Sanders.\nBernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.\nYou've put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong.\nAnd to all of your supporters here and around the country, I want you to know I've heard you. Your cause is our cause.\nOur country needs your ideas, energy and passion. That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America. We wrote it together, now let's go out and make it happen together!\nMy friends, we've come to Philadelphia, the birthplace of our nation, because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today. We all know the story, but we usually focus on how it turned out and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.\nWhen representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king and some wanted to stick it to the king.\nThe Revolution hung in the balance, and somehow they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose. And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation. That's what made it possible to stand up to a king. That took courage, they had courage. Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.\nNow America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our Founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we will all work together so we can all rise together.\nOur country's motto is E Pluribus Unum, out of many we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?\nWell, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other. He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He's taken the Republican Party a long way, from morning in America to midnight in America.\nHe wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, you know, a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!\nNow, we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge just as we always have. We will not build a wall; instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy.\nWe will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism.\nYet, we know there is a lot to do. Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash. There's too much inequality, too little social mobility, too much paralysis in Washington.\nToo many threats at home and abroad. But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges.\nWe have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world.\nWe have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had.\nWe have the most powerful military, the most innovative entrepreneurs, the most enduring values, freedom and equality, justice and opportunity, we should be so proud that those words are associated with us.\nI have to tell you, as your secretary of state I went to 112 countries. When people hear those words, they hear America!\nSo don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not. Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don't believe anyone who says I alone can fix it.\nYes, those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us. Really? I alone can fix it? Isn't he forgetting troops on the front lines, police officers and firefighters who run toward danger, doctors and nurses who care for us, teachers who change lives, entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem, mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe? He's forgetting every last one of us.\nAmericans don't say \"I alone can fix it.\" We say \"we'll fix it together!\"\nAnd remember, remember, our Founders fought a Revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power.\n240 years later, we still put our faith in each other. Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.\nThat's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.\nTwenty years ago I wrote a book called \"It Takes a Village.\" And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck do you mean by that? This is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.\nAmerica needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart. That's why \"stronger together\" is not just a lesson from our history, it's not just a slogan for our campaign, it's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build, a country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nWhere you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what ZIP code you live in. A country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach, where families are strong, communities are safe and, yes, where love trumps hate.\nThat's the country we're fighting for. That's the future we're working toward. And so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America's promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States!\nNow, sometimes\u2014sometimes\u2014the people at this podium are new to the national stage. As you know, I'm not one of those people. I've been your first lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York, then I represented all of you as secretary of state.\nBut my job titles only tell you what I've done. They don't tell you why. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the service part has always come easier to me than the public part.\nI get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.\nSo let me tell you. The family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind, builders in the way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had, whatever God gave them and whatever life in America provided and built better lives and better futures for their kids.\nMy grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years.\nBecause he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right. My dad, Hugh, made it to college, he played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor. When the war was over, he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching him stand for hours over silkscreens. He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had, and he did.\nMy mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14 working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others. Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought extra food to share the entire year.\nThe lessons she passed on to me years later stuck with me. No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.\nSo I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to- door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school. I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school. It just didn't seem possible in those days. And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child.\nIt became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action.\nSo we gathered facts, we built a coalition and our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. It's a big idea, isn't it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.\nBut how? How do you make an idea like that real? You do it step by step, year by year, sometimes even door by door. My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage.\nBecause we changed our law to make sure she got an education. So it's true. I sweat the details of policy, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs.\nBecause it's not just a detail if it's your kid, if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to you president, too.\nAfter the four days of this convention, you've seen some of the people who have inspired me, people who let me into their lives and became a part of mine, people like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night.\nI first met Ryan as a 7-year old. He was wearing a full-body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds because I leaned over to lift him up. Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country.\nLauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9\/11. It was the thought of her and Debbie St. John who you saw in the movie and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney and all the victims and survivors that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9\/11 families and our first responders who got sick from their time at ground zero.\nI was thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.\nAnd in this campaign, I've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.\nAnd you heard from Republicans and independents who are supporting our campaign. Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don't. For all Americans together!\nTonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union. The first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president!\nStanding here as my mother's daughter and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come. I'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. I'm happy for boys and men. Because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone.\nAfter all, when there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit!\nSo let's keep going. Let's keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have!\nBut even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years ahead.\nLet's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.\nNow, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.\nOur economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private sector jobs, 20 million more Americans with health insurance, and an auto industry that just had its best year ever.\nNow, that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo, not by a long shot. We're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.\nI've gone around the country talking to working families and I've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them. Some of you are frustrated, even furious. And you know what? You're right. It's not yet working the way it should. Americans are willing to work and work hard, but right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect for them, period.\nDemocrats, we are the party of working people.\nBut we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through, and we're going to do something to help. So tonight I want to tell you how we will empower Americans to live better lives.\nMy primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States.\nFrom my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind, from our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian country to coal country, from communities ravaged by addiction, to regions hollowed out by plant closures.\nAnd here's what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.\nThat's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them.\nAnd if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United!\nI believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are, but too many aren't. It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.\nAnd I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again.\nAnd I believe in science!\nI believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying, clean-energy jobs.\nI believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out.\nComprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together. And it's the right thing to do.\nSo whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.\nIf you believe that companies should share profits, not pad executive bonuses, join us!\nIf you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us!\nIf you believe that every man, woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care, join us!\nIf you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and home-grown manufacturers, then join us!\nIf you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, then join us!\nAnd yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us!\nThat's how we're going to make sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nNow, you didn't hear any of this, did you, from Donald Trump at his convention? He spoke for 70-odd minutes\u2014and I do mean odd\u2014and he offered zero solutions. But we already know he doesn't believe these things. No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans. You might have noticed I love talking about mine.\nIn my first 100 days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.\nBernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for all.\nWe will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.\nIt's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts and students and families can't refinance their debts.\nAnd something we don't say often enough, sure, college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.\nWe will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.\nWe will give small businesses, like my dad's, a boost, make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. In America, if you can dream it you should be able to build it.\nAnd we will help you balance family and work. And you know what? If fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card, then deal me in!\nNow, here's the other thing.\nNow, we're not only going to make all of these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them. And here's how: Wall Street, corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.\nThis is not because we resent success. But when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is. And we are going to follow the money.\nAnd if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back and we'll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home.\nNow, I imagine that some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good, but how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington?\nWell, look at my record. I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that's exactly what I'll do as president.\nBut then I also imagine people are thinking out there, but Trump, he's a businessman, he must know something about the economy.\nWell, let's take a closer look, shall we? In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.\nNow, remember what the president said last night: Don't boo; vote!\nBut think of this. People who did the work and needed the money, not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them. He just stiffed them. And you know that sales pitch he's making to be president, put your faith in him and you'll win big? That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away and left working people holding the bag.\nHe also talks a big game about putting America first. Well, please explain what part of \"America first\" leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado, Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan, Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio, Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin?\nDonald Trump says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again.\nNow, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security.\nYou know, anyone\u2014anyone\u2014reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face, from Baghdad to Kabul to Nice and Paris and Brussels, from San Bernardino to Orlando. We're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.\nSo it's no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance, looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home.\nKeeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority. I'm proud that we've put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.\nNow we have to enforce it. And we must keep supporting Israel's security.\nI'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement. Now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.\nAnd I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.\nI've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.\nIt won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake we will prevail.\nNow, Donald Trump, Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do.\" No, Donald, you don't.\nHe thinks he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are a disaster.\nWell, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure. We entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death. A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country...including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.\nSo just ask yourself, do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? Donald Trump can't even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation, when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, when he's challenged in a debate, when he sees a protester at a rally. Imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.\nA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons!\nI can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men, the ones moved by fear and pride.\nAmerica's strength doesn't come from lashing out. It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power. And that's the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be.\nAnd if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a president who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.\nI'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.\nWe will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.\nYou know, for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But I ask you, how can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard, you saw family members of people killed by gun violence, on this stage. You heard, you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.\nI refuse to believe we can't find common ground here. We have to heal the divides in our country, not just on guns, but on race, immigration and more.\nAnd that starts with listening, listening to each other, trying as best we can to walk in each other's shoes. So let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism and are made to feel like their lives are disposable!\nLet's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers kissing their kids and spouses good-bye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\nAnd we will defend all our rights, civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities.\nAnd we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from. You know, for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments, excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.\nThey thought he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says. Like when he called women pigs, or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage, or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability or insults prisoners of war, like John McCain, a hero and a patriot who deserves our respect.\nNow, at first, at first, I admit, I couldn't he meant it either. It was just too hard to fathom that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things, could be like that. But here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump, this is it.\nAnd in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: America is great because America is good!\nSo enough with the bigotry and the bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change, he's offering empty promises. And what are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, to get your kids the opportunities they deserve.\nThe choice is clear, my friends. Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger. None of us ever have or can do it alone. I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together. But I'm here to tell you tonight progress is possible. I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.\nAnd I know it from my own life. More than a few times I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game.\nLike so much else in my life, I got this from my mother, too. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door, go back out there, she said. And she was right.\nYou have to stand up to bullies. You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\nWe lost our mother a few years ago, but I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right no matter what. That's what we need to do together as a nation.\nAnd though we may not live to see the glory, as the song from the musical \"Hamilton\" goes, let us gladly join the fight, let our legacy be about planting seeds in a garden you never get to see. That's why we're here, not just in this hall, but on this earth. The Founders showed us that and so have many others since. They were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.\nThat is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight.\nYes, the world is watching what we do. Yes, America's destiny is ours to choose. So let's be stronger together, my fellow Americans!\nLet's look to the future with courage and confidence. Let's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. And when we do, America will be greater than ever!\nThank you, and may God bless you and the United States of America!\n","131":"\nDonald Trump. So, it's been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference. And you, as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports, should ask yourselves why. And I'll tell you why. Because despite the nice platitudes, she's been a mess.\nYou look at what's happened with ISIS, which isn't even mentioned. You look at what's happening with law and order, they don't even mention our police. They mention everybody but our police. They don't have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags, one that we saw.\nSo you know, I put myself through your news conferences often, not that its fun. 235 days, no news conference for Hillary Clinton. You oughta check it out because there's a lot going on.\nHer great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she totally rigged it. Bernie Sanders never had a chance.\nAnd total disloyalty, it's like you're fired, get out, fast. The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation, both very serious. What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible, absolutely horrible.\nIf I would've used language like they used about religion, about race, about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I would've had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race.\nWith her, everything's just fine. So just ask yourself why she doesn't have news conferences. And honestly, the reason is because there's no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad.\nWhen they talk about change, I noticed they have change. She's been there for 30 years. Thirty years. There's no change. It's going to be the same, it's going to be an extension of Obama. In my opinion, worse.\nShe lied about TPP. She was for TPP, she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because it's a horror show, it's going to kill all our jobs, it's going to be almost as bad as NAFTA, maybe worse which her husband signed, by the way, which destroyed this country, destroyed manufacturing in the United States.\nAnd I'll do something about it, that'll be so renegotiated. And by the way, yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements. First time, yesterday. Well, because of me.\nShe also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation. And she heard it and she said wow, she can't win that subject in a debate.\nSo all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP, her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now he's going against it. And Bernie Sanders was right, he was against it.\nThey will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins, which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesn't. They will vote it in\u2014just mark my words, hopefully we don't have to worry about it\u2014but she will vote.\nShe'll change a comma, she'll change a paragraph of the 6,000 page document that nobody's even read on our side. Just so you understand, the other countries know every word, every paragraph, every sentence, every single comma and period.\nWe don't even read it, our country. Because we're led by stupid people. so she saw me talking about TPP, she realized that she couldn't defend it, her special interests are pushing her hard because she's bought and sold by the special interests.\nThey're pushing her very hard and so she said she's against it. The day she gets in\u2014which hopefully will never happen\u2014she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP. And that will be another disaster for job in our country, OK?\nSo why don't we start off any questions? Yes, sir?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia. In fact, I saw her campaign manager I don't know his title, Mook. I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hacking.\nBy the way, they hacked\u2014they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.\nBut I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked. Now, first of all was what was said on those that's so bad but he said I watched it. I think he was live. But he said we think it was Russia that hacked.\nAnd then he said\u2014and this is in person sitting and watching television as I've been doing\u2014and then he said could be Trump, yeah, yeah. Trump, Trump, oh yeah, Trump. He reminded me of John Lovitz for \"Saturday Night Live\" in the liar where he'd go yes, yes, I went to Harvard, Harvard, yes, yes. This is the guy, you have to see it. Yes, it could be Trump, yes, yes. So it is so farfetched. It's so ridiculous. Honestly I wish I had that power. I'd love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our country.\nAnd that's why\u2014if it is Russia, nobody even knows this, it's probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed. But it shows how weak we are, it shows how disrespected we are. Total\u2014assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country. Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader. So I know nothing about it. It's one of the most farfetched I've ever heard. Yes, Jon?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but there's nothing that I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I'm all for it and let's go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast.\nYou saw what happened with the priest, it's only going to get worse. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are, where they come from, where their documentation is, it's only going to get worse and it's going to start getting bad in our country. We're letting people come in by the tens of thousands. You see what happened to the French priest. A friend of mine, he said he was going to France, like three, four months ago. I saw him yesterday. I said how'd you like France. He said I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to France. Because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. They won't like me for saying that but you see what happened in Nice, you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man. France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and they'll never do it with Hillary Clinton.\nAnd by the way, in terms of change, she's been there for 30 years. She's been doing this for 30 years. What she's going to go all of sudden things are going to change? She's bought and sold 100 percent by special interests and lobbyists. Yes, Tom?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. None, none.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Because it's under order. And I'll release them when the audits completed. Nobody would release when it's under\u2014I've had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. I'm under audit, when the audits complete I'll release them. But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I don't know, I don't know. It depends on the audit. It depends on the audit, not a big deal. By the way, just so you understand, I've released my papers, 104 pages of documents. I built an unbelievable company, tremendous cash, tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world. You've seen it. You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but that's OK. Far, far great than anybody ever thought. I have a great company. I built an unbelievable company but if you look there you'll see there's nothing in Russia.\nAnd as far as the tax returns, as soon as the audits complete, like any lawyer would tell you, Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago, she's a lawyer. She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when they're under audit. It's a routine audit. I've gone through audits, which I think is very unfair, for 15 years. I have friends that are very rich and never get audited. I'm audited every year. Maybe that's because of politics, who knows.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I'm not going to tell Putin what to do. Why should I tell Putin what to do? He already did something today where he said don't blame them, essentially, for your incompetence. Let me tell you, it's not even about Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking. It was about the things that were said in those e-mails. They were terrible things, talking about Jewish, talking about race, talking about atheist, trying to pin labels on people\u2014what was said was a disgrace, and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and believe me, as sure as you're sitting there, Hillary Clinton knew about it. She knew everything.\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary Clinton. Couldn't breathe. And you saw that. It also showed that it was a fixed race, but I've been saying that long before I saw the e-mails. It was a rigged race. It was totally rigged. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary Clinton, and the sad part is, Bernie Sanders has, to use an old word that I use on occasion, he's lost his energy. He wants to go home and go to sleep. But he's got a lot of people that walked out last night. Now, hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night. I didn't even hear about it. Nobody showed it. I didn't see it on television. You people don't talk about it.\nThe Republican Convention was incredible. I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades. Like, some people are saying nine points. In fact, a poll just came out ten minutes ago, \"Los Angeles Times\", Trump 47, Clinton 40. And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary Clinton.\nQuestion. [inaudible] Putin say stay out? Why not say that?\nDonald Trump. Why do I have to get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia\u2014which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is\u2014but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see\u2014I will tell you this\u2014Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir...\nQuestion. [inaudible] this audience and make our campaign\u2014what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum wage in this country [inaudible]?\nOK. Sure. Two big questions. The minimum wage has to go up. People are\u2014at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states\u2014federal\u2014I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage\u2014but it has to go up.\nNow, Bernie Sanders lied. Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7. I said, where did he come up with that one? That one is just like Joe Biden lied today. He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb\u2014he was on television\u2014he said, Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the Middle East. Now, that was Ted Cruz that said that. That was not Donald Trump. I mean, he's not a very bright guy, but that was Ted Cruz that said it. And he said it with such surety\u2014Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb\u2014I never said I wanted to carpet bomb. That was Ted Cruz. You remember Ted Cruz said it? You will confirm that, I think. Go ahead.\nSo I would like to raise it to at least $10, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to\u2014literally, they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country, because I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico, which is booming, booming. I have a friend who builds plants and he's a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day\u2014great guy. He builds massive plants, for automobiles, for computers, for anything. That's what he does. I think he's the biggest, but certainly one of the biggest.\nAnd I said, how's it going? He said, unbelievable. Oh good, that's good news. The country's doing well. No, the country's not doing well, but Mexico is unbelievable. The plants I'm building in Mexico, I've never seen anything\u2014it's the eighth wonder of the world. And he's not happy. He's an American guy. He'd rather build them here. But he said it's unbelievable. That's what's happened to our country. Because we have leadership that doesn't know what they're doing.\nQuestion. [inaudible] special extreme vetting?\nDonald Trump. Yes we're going to be listing; yeah we're going to be giving a list of those territories. And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting. And we're going to have extreme vetting anyway. Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions. And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether it's the World Trade Center or whether it's a lot of other things, and you look all over the world and you see what's happening.\nYou look at Orlando, how bad was that? And that was horrible. That was going after the gay community it looks like. We can't let this happen. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let people come in.\nNow Hillary Clinton likes to up it. Her running mate Tim Kaine, who by the way did a terrible job in New Jersey. First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and he's not very popular in New Jersey. And he still isn't. What?\nI mean Virginia. The first thing he did, the first thing that Tim Kaine did, he asked for a $4 billion tax increase. And he's not very popular. So let me just tell you, and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day. And I thought he'd be popular. He's not popular because he asked for tax increases. Big tax increases in Virginia. Big. And also the unemployment went up, I think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenure.\nBut what he wanted to do is very strongly and he's on record, he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary Clinton wants. And it's unacceptable. OK. Yes? [inaudible]\nQuestion. Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the charges...\nDonald Trump. I saw that.\nQuestion. Against police involved in the Freddie Gray case.\nDonald Trump. Right.\nQuestion. Your reaction [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers, I do. I think she ought to prosecute herself OK? That's my reaction. I think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it. And the news conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the facts.\nAnd I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal. I give a lot of respect, a lot of credit that they stuck it out. And you had victory after victory after victory. And she had no chance, don't forget she prosecuted the best case, what she thought was her best cases first. She should prosecute herself. She should be held accountable.\nQuestion. [inaudible] to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case. Freddie Gray is now a cause celebre.\nDonald Trump. Well, that was a bad case to prove it. That was a bad case. I mean if you're going to do that, it's OK because you have to, you know, there are times when police officers behave very badly. But you have to get the right time. This was not one of those times. And I think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did. Yes ma'am?\nQuestion. So as you've gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about him...\nDonald Trump. Yeah.\nQuestion. And [inaudible]...\nDonald Trump. I have a great relationship with Governor Pence. We spent the last three days together. He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press. The press was saying, and it was interesting, I spoke to him at 11:05, him and his wife, and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if I'd be lucky enough for him to accept. And he accepted. And that was it. For me that was it.\nBut right around that time you had the attack in Nice. And I was going to have a news conference either the following morning or the next day. And of course I had to delay the news conference because there was attack, a horrible attack, horrible. In France. And I delayed the news conference and everyone said, oh he's having second thoughts. I never had a second thought in my life. It was such a lie. I mean so many lies in the press. But it was such a lie. And he has been so great. Honestly he's been even better than I thought OK? Better.\nQuestion. Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of date?\nDonald Trump. I think everything's is out of date. We have a whole new world. When I said that NATO, to Wolf Blitzer, is obsolete, I got attacked. Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right. You know what? We have a lot of things that are out date because they're 20 and 30 and 40 years old.\nNATO, you know this isn't a country from 40 years ago. Today we have a different threat. We have a terror threat. And we have an ISIS threat. And by the way, ISIS isn't even mentioned. It's not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention. And everyone's talking about it. The reason they can't mention it is because they grew it.\nGo ahead.\nQuestion. What would you renegotiate: the enhanced interrogation aspect of it? The...\nDonald Trump. I would\u2014Katy, I would renegotiate so much of everything. I'm going to renegotiate our trade deals where we're losing with everybody, Katy. I'm going to renegotiate our military deals where we're protecting countries and they're not living up to the bargain. They're not living up to the bargain. And everyone agrees with me, except for the media.\nAnd the media never says that. I like NATO, just so you understand. I like NATO. I like the concept of NATO. It is somewhat outdated because it doesn't cover terror the way it should. I've been saying this for six months now. A couple of months ago, front page, Wall Street Journal, \"We are going to cover terror,\" they announced somebody.\nI think NATO's great. But it's got to be modernized. And\u2014and countries that we're protecting have to pay what they're supposed to be paying.\nQuestion. On the Geneva Convention [inaudible].\nDonald Trump. Yes?\nQuestion. Do you think that they should allow for that, given the [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation, yes.\nAnd by the way, it works.\nQuestion. [inaudible] will you defend the Baltic states if they're invaded by Russia? According to...\nDonald Trump. I'll tell you what. Let me say it once again. Let me say it once again. OK? Many countries, including the NATO countries, some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe. And they can afford to pay this. It's not like they can't afford it.\nThey just see us as a soft touch. You know, in business we say somebody's a soft touch. I don't know if I've been called a soft touch, but maybe I have sometimes. But in business, they call them a soft touch. They haven't paid us. OK? I want them to pay.\nExcuse me. I'm not saying anything. I don't talk. I'm not like Obama where he tells you everything he's going to do\u2014we're going to go and do this; we're going to go and do that. I don't talk. But they're going to pay.\nNo, no\u2014yeah, it sends a signal. You know what signal it says? It says we're going to pay.\nYou know, somebody said, \"but we have treaties.\" I said that's right. And in the treaties, they're supposed to pay. They're going to pay. And they will pay. They will pay.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Yes?\nQuestion. [inaudible] how are you planning to [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. We're going to have a whole policy on that over the next three weeks. I'm going to be doing a big thing on that.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Well, I've been doing very well with the Hispanic community. I mean, really well. I mean, the\u2014the poll numbers are going up very high. I think we had one recently 35 or 36. But I'm going to have a whole\u2014we're going to have a news conference on that over the next three weeks.\nSo, and I want to just tell you because these polls cover it, so L.A. Times, 47-40; CNN, way up. They're all way up. Biggest\u2014they say the biggest bounce in memory. Because today I heard a dishonest guy on television say, \"Well, Trump didn't get much of a bounce.\" So, you know, I have to at least say.\nJeremy, go ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible] do you believe that Vladimir Putin would rather deal with President Trump or President Clinton?\nDonald Trump. I don't think he respects Clinton. I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton. I think he does respect me. And I hope I get along great with him. It's possible that we won't, Jeremy. I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship.\nRight now, we don't have a good relationship. Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things. OK? He mentioned the \"N\" word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the \"N\" word. You know what the \"N\" word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked.\nHe has a total lack of respect for President Obama. Number one, he doesn't like him. And number two, he doesn't respect him. I think he's going to respect your president if I'm elected. And I hope he likes me.\nYes? Yes, sir?\nQuestion. [inaudible] relations?\nDonald Trump. Yes, sir.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. But let me finish with Jeremy. Go ahead.\nQuestion. Would a President Trump be better for U.S.-Russia relations than [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations. You can't be worse. Hey look, when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that I've always found fascinating, one thing that I've always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China. Well, they're united now, in a true sense. They've never been closer.\nThey're selling oil to China. We forced them into this position.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. No, wait a minute.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. No, I'm not going to be an adversary. No, not at all. I have tenants from China. I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent. I mean, I have great relationships with China. I'm not blaming China for getting away with murder. I'm blaming our leadership is incompetent. We don't know what we're doing.\nI don't blame\u2014I respect China. Hey, if China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars\u2014if they can get away with that, my hat's off to them.\nI have no problem with China. I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen. And I believe that Hillary Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack Obama. I think it will get worse.\nIt's going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people, you see that. But I believe that Hillary Clinton will be worse, than Obama.\nYes?\nQuestion. [off-mike] you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordable.\nDonald Trump. That's right.\nQuestion. Working on a plan...\nDonald Trump. That's right, I'm going to be doing something over the next four weeks, very much so.\nQuestion. Are you prepared to give us any sort of...\nDonald Trump. No, I'm prepared to say we're gonna have a great plan. One of the things I think because I've traveled all over the country and I'm going\u2014you know where I'm going, I guess you all know, I don't have to say.\nBut I'm going to Toledo and I'm going to different places today and I've met so many people. This is such a great country, these are such great people. one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard, that go to colleges, good colleges, they're good students, they do a great job.\nNumber one, they get out, they have no jobs. Because our jobs are going to Mexico, they're going to China, they're going to Japan, they're going all over the place. They're not coming here. Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesn't build them here, much.\nAnd the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their\u2014up to their neck. They can't breathe, they're scared, they're so scared they have leveraged their entire life. They have loans.\nAnd I have to tell you, the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it. Because the students get government money, passes through but the number gets higher and higher.\nBecause college costs are out of control, because the colleges say what difference does it make? If you take a look at the salaries being paid, you take a look at what's going on with the colleges.\nBecause all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it. So the colleges are costing so much money. We are going to help the students. Maybe that doesn't fit beautifully within the Republican framework.\nBut I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it. We have to help our students. Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where it's making them sick.\nOur students are under tremendous pressure, we have to help our students. And I'm going to have a plan over the next four weeks.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion. [off-mike] talking about possibly...\nDonald Trump. Everything's on the table, you'll see. Everything\u2014it's a very important\u2014it's a very important subject.\nYes, ma'am?\nQuestion. Mr. Trump, [off-mike].\nDonald Trump. I think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border, if they don't want people pouring into our country. Likewise, they have confidence with me on ISIS, not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because I will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our people.\nI think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like there's nothing to it. And then they make their product, they sell it back to the United States, no tax, no nothing, we get nothing except unemployment.\nAnd I think people see that. I can tell you I mean I'm like a pollster myself when I'm in front of these massive audiences, one of the things that gets constantly\u2014you people know because you're there\u2014the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\nBecause Obamacare is a disaster. In Texas, going through BlueCross\/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase. On November 1st, you're going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare, having to do with increases. President Obama is trying to get it moved to December. Because it is election-defying. It is going to be a massive number, the biggest number ever in our country's history for health care. It's going to be announced on November 1st.\nI just asked the press, don't let him do that. Obamacare is a disaster, people are dying with it. It's a disaster and everybody knows and it's going to fold, anyway.\nIn '17 unfortunately\u2014if I'm president\u2014I mean I've got to take over this mess. It's going to fold, anyway. But repeal and replace Obamacare, people like it.\nThey like the fact that I'm going to protect the Second Amendment, they like the fact that I'm going to rebuild our military which is very depleted. Those are the things that are resonating.\nAnd they don't feel Hillary Clinton can do it.\nJohn, go ahead, John.\nQuestion. [off-mike] Russia has no business in you\u2014that you don't have any...\nDonald Trump. No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John. How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia.\nAnd even\u2014for anything. What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Florida.\nPalm Beach is a very expensive place. There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I told it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago. I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Of course I can. I told you, other than normal stuff\u2014I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian. I have nothing to do with Russia. I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Of course not. I own the Trump organization. Zero, zero. Go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I am.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I did.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. I did. Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United States. But she would be so wrong. And even women say that. Women don't like her. She would be so wrong. Look, Hillary Clinton is a disaster. She's been a disaster. And even the story told by her husband last night, he left out the most interesting chapter. I won't get into that.\nThe chapter that I really waited for, because it was pretty boring, the chapter that I waited for, I never heard. And he left it out. Look, Hillary Clinton's a disaster. I'd love to see a woman become president and it'll happen, absolutely. But I think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary Clinton. Yes ma'am?\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes, I do.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful, they have to be very, very well trained. I speak about it all the time, in fact I mentioned the most recent death, excuse me, I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota. I speak about it all the time. It's a real problem because if the police do 100,000 great jobs and they have one, either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job, you see that incident on television for weeks. It's a real problem.\nYou don't see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100,000, out of more than that, it's on television night after night after night. The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time. Yes, ma'am, go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Oh, go ahead, go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. No, but they seem to be, if it's Russians. I have no idea. It's probably not Russia. Nobody knows if it's Russia. You know the sad thing is? That with the technology and the genius we have in this country, not in government unfortunately, but with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails. We don't even know who it is.\nI heard this morning, one report said they don't think it's Russia, they think it might be China. Another report said it might be just a hacker, some guy with a 200 I.Q. that can't get up in the morning, OK? Nobody knows. Honestly they have no idea if it's Russia. Might be Russia. But if it's any foreign country, it shows how little respect they have for the United States. Yes, ma'am.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Well, and the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people, they've got something bad going on up there. That's something really bad going on. And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism, a term that our president refuses to use, I can't he's still not using it. He's still not using it. And she doesn't want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it. She said she will use it but so far she didn't.\nShe'll probably use it tonight. Like the American flags, as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage, it was a disgrace. You had a room with a massive stage without flags. I think this\u2014I think that the people in the community know what's going on. Whether it's in a mosque or whether it's in the community and they have to report these people. When you look at San Bernardino, people knew\u2014many people knew what was going on. They had bombs lying all over the floor. They had bombs on the floor. I mean, this isn't\u2014you walk into somebody's house, there are bombs lying on the floor\u2014I think there's a problem there. You got to report it.\nAnd by the way, David Hinckley should not have been freed, OK? David Hinckley was just released\u2014John Hinckley\u2014I think that John Hinckley\u2014excuse me, John Hinckley, should not have been freed. I just heard about it.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion. Do you have any pause about asking a foreign government\u2014Russia, China, anybody\u2014to interfere, to hack into the system of anybody's in this country...\nDonald Trump. That's up to the President. Let the President talk to them. Look, here's the problem. Here's the problem, Katy. Katy, here's the problem, very simple. He has no respect...\nQuestion. [inaudible] 30,000 e-mails...\nDonald Trump. Well, they probably have them. I'd like to have them released.\nQuestion. Does that not give you pause?\nDonald Trump. No, it gives me no pause. If they have them, they have them. We might as well\u2014hey, you know what gives me more pause? That a person in our government, crooked Hillary Clinton\u2014here's what gives me pause. Be quiet. I know you want to save her. That a person in our government, Katy, would delete or get rid of 33,000 e- mails. That gives me a big problem. After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 e-mails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion. A question about Mike Pence, because \"The New York Times\" reported that [inaudible] conversation with John Kasich's campaign, [inaudible] says, you can be the most powerful [inaudible]...\nDonald Trump. That's the most ridiculous conversation. He never had the\u2014Don Jr. told me\u2014let me just tell you. Let me save you a lot of boredom.\nQuestion. [inaudible] Mike Pence's role as vice president if you are elected?\nDonald Trump. Mike Pence will play a big role, but I just want to tell you about John Kasich. I never spoke to him about being vice president. We don't have good chemistry together. I have never spoken to him about being vice president. I would never pick him to be vice president. There was never a conversation, and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little bit shaky. He never spoke\u2014Don Jr. would never\u2014and that was so long ago, I didn't even know I was going to get the nomination at that point. Just so you understand, I would not have picked John Kasich, wouldn't be the right guy. I mean, for that to have gotten out, that was so ridiculous. And then, I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy. So what's left for the president? I think you know me better than that. That was put out by him. He's a nice man, John Kasich, he's fine. He's fine. I would never have chosen him.\nNow, I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people. There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice president, but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike Pence is doing a great job.\nLet me just explain\u2014I never asked John Kasich to be vice president, nor would I. And by the way, I'm leading in Ohio by three points.\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. It probably has. It probably has. Our government is so weak on this stuff. It probably has. Possible. I mean, I have a lot of checks and balance. I have a good system, I guess. I'm not an e- mail person, myself. I don't believe in it, because I think it can be hacked, for one thing. But when I send an e-mail, I mean, if I send one, I send one almost never. I'm just not a believer in e-mail. A lot of people have taught me that, including Hillary. But honestly, it could be, maybe it's hacked. Who knows?\nQuestion. [inaudible] broken the rules in traditional American politics many times. [inaudible] while the other person...\nDonald Trump. Yes, but my message wasn't dark. My message was optimistic, because we're going to fix the problems. Go ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. OK.\nQuestion. You've broken that tradition, you've run a very aggressive campaign this week. What was the basis for wanting to do it this way as opposed to staying quiet...\nDonald Trump. No basis. No basis.\nLook, John, I didn't have to do this. When I did this, believe me\u2014you see this incredible resort. It's one of the great in the world. When I did this, I could be here enjoying myself. I don't have to be with you guys. I didn't need this. I have places that are the best in the world, OK. I could be doing other things. I'm doing this because we're going to make America great again. I'm doing this because when I looked at the Iran deal, which was incompetent\u2014when I looked at what's going on with jobs being torn out of our country and going to Mexico and China, what's happening with China. And with all of this, with ISIS, with our military being so badly depleted where we have old fighter jets. We have to take parts from museums and from graveyards.\nWhen I look at all this I say I sort of have to do it. You know this country's been great to me. I'm giving back. That's all.\nNow as far as running a campaign, I guess it's probably not typical. But they said that against, you know when I ran there was 17 people, a total of 17. Governors, Senators, Ben Carson who's a fantastic guy, capable people. Wait a minute. Everybody said, oh he can never win because look what he's doing. He's giving a talk to 5,000 people in New Hampshire instead of going to everybody's house and having dinner.\nAnd then I won New Hampshire. And then I won you know 38 or 39 states. And won by the way, not by a little bit. Won with the highest vote in the history of the Republican Party. So just...\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. OK but John but the point is this, so it's a different kind of a campaign. But it's what I think is good. I think it's good. I think it's working here too.\nQuestion. But this aggressive counterprogramming the Democratic Convention is different than what we've seen in previous campaigns. And I'm wondering why you felt the need to make sure that everything that was said was responded to immediately with personal appearances, with campaign appearances while they were [inaudible]...\nDonald Trump. Well, when Joe Biden says that I want to firebomb the enemy, which was on television this morning, or carpet bomb. He used the term carpet bomb. When he makes the statement that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb, I never said that. That was Ted Cruz that said that OK? That was Ted Cruz, wasn't me.\nWhen Sanders, and I think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade. But when Bernie Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum wage, lower, it's a lie. So I have a choice. All my people say don't respond to it, it doesn't matter. I say to me it does matter. It matters.\nWhen people tell lies, politicians who tell lies very well, that's what they do, that's why they're politicians. But when politicians tell lies, and I'm lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone. In other words I can say that Biden lied when he said that. Or I can say that I didn't say that, Bernie Sanders. And you guys know that I didn't. In fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said it.\nSo it's nice to be able to, President Obama said a year-and-a- half ago, Donald Trump will never be president. Today on \"The Today Show\" he said, this is democracy. A little bit different. Little bit different. [laughter]\nDavid, go ahead Dave.\nQuestion. Last night at the Democratic Convention [inaudible] women and gay advocates made strong cases that you and the Republican Party are kind of on the wrong side of history regarding abortion rights and gay marriage. Can you clarify your position on those?\nDonald Trump. You'll have to see it in the polls David. You know what my positions are. You'll have to see it at the polls.\nQuestion. I don't know what...\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Yeah go ahead.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. David my positions are down. You ask the question every single time. I give you an answer. My positions are down. Take a look. Go ahead.\nQuestion. Didn't you hold a Miss Universe Pageant\u2014?\nDonald Trump. Yes I did.\nQuestion. Did Don Jr. say back in 2008 that there was Russian money pouring into the top organizations...\nDonald Trump. We wanted to, yeah, I don't know what he said. But we wanted...\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Excuse me, listen. We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia. It was a tremendous success. Very, very successful. And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia. And they wanted us to do it. But it never worked out.\nFrankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Yes ma'am go ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible] President Obama has said that you would never win the presidency. Last night he said that anything is possible.\nDonald Trump. He did say that.\nQuestion. What is your reaction to that?\nDonald Trump. Well, I just said sort of said that. He just said that. He said it this morning, anything's possible. I think I'm going to win. I think people are sick and tired of incompetence. They're sick and tired of having politicians leading them down the tubes. Whether it's taxes, whether it's debt, whether it's any one of 15 different things. And that's why. I mean I think I'll win the election. I think you'll see that in the polls.\nAll right a few more questions. Go ahead John.\nQuestion. Back in December...\nDonald Trump. I hope your arm's OK.\nQuestion. It's all right. Back in December sir you had said that you were probably going to be going to Israel to go and meet the leadership. Now that you are the Republican nominee, it is a tradition once you secure the Party's nomination, to do a trip...\nDonald Trump. Well, it's a tradition but I don't do things that are traditional. But I have great support from Israel. I will back Israel 100 percent. I would like to go there. But I have great relationships as you know, to the people in Israel.\nAnd by the way, Obama in my opinion is the single worst thing politically speaking that's ever happened to Israel. He has been a disaster for Israel.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. I don't know. I don't know. I haven't set my schedule yet. It could happen.\nQuestion. [inaudible] you are the nominee. Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders trying to build up a relationship should you win in November, that you don't have to hit the ground running [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. No, I think we\u2014it's possible we have. But I'm not\u2014I'm only interested in winning. Once I win, I'll get along great with foreign leaders, but they won't be taking advantage. I mean, the problem we have with foreign leaders, whether it's China, Russia, or anybody, they don't respect our leadership. And certainly in the case of China, they take tremendous economic advantage of us\u2014tremendous, to a point that is hard to believe.\nI'll get along great with the leadership. And we'll do well.\nYes, ma'am, in the back?\nQuestion. Mr. Trump, [inaudible]\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. No, no. Excuse me. In the back?\nQuestion. I would like to know if you became president, would you recognize [inaudible] Crimea as Russian territory? And also if the U.S. would lift sanctions that are [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking.\nGo ahead.\nQuestion. Mr. Trump, [inaudible] questions. First, a quick one on the minimum wage. You said we need to raise it to $10. [inaudible] be clear here. Are you talking about the federal minimum wage?\nDonald Trump. Federal.\nQuestion. OK. Second question about [inaudible].\nDonald Trump. Right.\nQuestion. You said [inaudible]. Would religion be a part of the [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. I'm not making it a part. But at some point, maybe people will change their minds, but as of right now, I'm not making it a part.\nOK.\n[crosstalk]\nDonald Trump. Yes, ma'am? Go ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. Who said that?\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. Who?\nQuestion. [inaudible]\nDonald Trump. I think President Obama has been the most ignorant president in our history. His views of the world, as he says, don't jive. And the world is a mess. You look at what's happening with the migration, with Syria, with Libya, with Iraq, with everything he's touched. He has been a disaster as a president. He will go down as one of the worst presidents in the history of our country. It is a mess.\nAnd I believe that Hillary Clinton will be even worse.\nGo ahead.\nQuestion. [inaudible] polls you [inaudible]. You just said [inaudible].\nDonald Trump. Oh, [inaudible] just said that? Many polls show that you are winning? I can't believe it. Are you Katy Turek of NBC? It's a disguise.\nGo ahead.\n[laughter]\nQuestion. Many polls show you [inaudible]. He said he feels that you are [inaudible] not prepared to be president. Can you [inaudible] lay out for us and for him what you do on a daily basis? How does your [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. OK. Well, [inaudible].\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion. [inaudible] about what's going on [inaudible] and domestic affairs.\nDonald Trump. Sure. Well, you've been asking me a lot of questions for a lot of times. I've turned out to be right. I turned out to be right on NATO. After I said that on NATO, NATO changed their whole program because of me.\nExcuse me, Katy, Hillary Clinton said yesterday she's going to start renegotiating trade deals. She never said that in her life. She said it yesterday only because of me. I'm the one that's prepared. President Obama when he became president, he didn't know anything. This guy didn't know a thing. And honestly, today he knows less. Today, he knows less.\nHe's done a terrible job. I think I'm very prepared.\nNow, with that being said, I've been a businessman all my life, but I've been watching it. I've been seeing it. I've been feeling. And as you know, I've been very much involved in politics from the other side. I understand politics or I guess I wouldn't be here. I mean, I beat a lot of very talented people.\nQuestion. [inaudible] advisers, though?\nDonald Trump. I do. I have great foreign advisers. And you have a list. And I gave you a list. And the other day, as an example, General Quinn and General Flynn, and we have so many\u2014we have so many. As an example, I had a meeting three or four days ago, and I'm going to do a report on it, with seven or eight very, very talented advisers.\nNow, with all of that being said, a lot of people want the people that are doing it now; people that have certain names. Look at the mess they've gotten us into. They said, \"Have you spoken to so and so?\" Well, I said, but he was in favor of the war in Iraq many years ago, which I was not in favor of. \"Have you spoken to this one or that one?\" I said, they were all\u2014look at the job they've done.\nSo a lot of the people that you think are good because you know their name or because you see them on television, I don't think are good. Because look at the end result. The end result is our country is a mess. The Middle East has never been worse. Had we done nothing with the Middle East; had our presidents, with an \"S,\" gone to the beach and relaxed, we'd be in better shape than we are right now.\nAll right, Tom. A couple more. Go ahead, Tom.\nQuestion. [inaudible] security briefings. You're about to get one.\nDonald Trump. Yeah.\nQuestion. Do you expect your opinion on [inaudible] or your opinion on [inaudible].\nDonald Trump. Well, we'll have to see. I mean, that's my opinion. That's my opinion. We'll have to see. I have a real problem when Hillary Clinton, who gives open access to a phony server, is allowed to get these briefings. How does Hillary Clinton get a national security briefing when she's been probably hacked, when so much of her information, the director of the FBI said it was essentially negligent. It was negligent.\nNow why are they giving her briefings, why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our country and our security, why are they giving Hillary Clinton briefings? Because it's going to get revealed. I mean her number one person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who's a sleazeball and a pervert. And I'm not saying that, I mean that's recorded history, right?\nI don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets, OK? So how can Hillary Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldn't have had it and that they're missing 33,000 e-mails and that's just the beginning. So I don't think that I know at some point, they're going to be calling, they're going to want to brief me, but I'm not a talker about this stuff.\nI don't think that it's safe to have Hillary Clinton, in light of what just happened, and in light of what we just found out, I don't think it's safe to have Hillary Clinton be briefed on national security because the word will get out.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. No. He's not going to run for mayor. Oh, Don? He's not going to run for mayor. Don has no attention of running for mayor. But he did a great job the other night with his speech. Because he made a good speech, everyone says he should run for mayor. You know why? Because we have a Democratic mayor who's horrible, he's doing a horrible job, de Blasio. But Don is not going to run for\u2014he has no interest in running for mayor.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes. Question. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Unbelievable what he said. I think it's disgraceful. Hillary Clinton, because of me, said that TPP is not going to happen. But we all know it is going to happen if she won. Terry McAuliffe said with a wink that if Hillary gets in, she's lying and it will happen. And there is nobody closer, I know this for a fact, there is nobody, including her own husband, closer to Hillary Clinton than Terry McAuliffe, OK? Go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Oh I don't know what he said, Jon, I really\u2014Anthony Weiner's\u2014look, look, look\u2014Anthony Weiner is a proven loser. I mean the poor guy, he's locked up in a room. They lock him up in a room, they don't let him out. I don't know what Anthony\u2014my son doesn't want to run for mayor. He has no intention of running for mayor.\nAnd besides that, as a Republican, you have a very tiny sliver in Manhattan, as you know, and in that area. It's almost impossible for a Republican to win. So, and my son likes to win, but my son has no intention of running for mayor so let's just put that to bed. Go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes, in [inaudible] very sad. Not [inaudible].\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Yes, I'm looking at it. I actually want to find out what causes it. It's a problem in many areas, OK? Yes, go ahead.\nQuestion. [off-mike]\nDonald Trump. Well, they shouted\u2014you know what was interesting. Yesterday I made a speech in front of the great veterans as you saw, and it was very well received, she was there the day before. And when I started talking about Hillary Clinton, the veterans who saw her 24 hours before, started screaming, \"Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up.\" They also screamed that, as you know, during the speech I made. The big speech.\nDonald Trump. And I said, \"Don't do that.\" Now, I didn't do that for any reason. I really\u2014I didn't like it. And they stopped. Not one reporter said that I said that. They all said\u2014they started screaming \"Lock her up! Lock her up.\" I said, \"Don't do that.\" Nobody reported that I said that, because it's dishonest reporting.\nYou do agree I said that, right?\nQuestion. You did say that.\nDonald Trump. OK. Well, why didn't somebody report that?\nQuestion. That's what I want to ask you about, you said you...\nDonald Trump. No, I think it's\u2014I think it's a shame that they said it, but a lot of people would say that should happen.\nOK, one more question, yes\u2014yes, ma'am, go ahead.\nQuestion. Yes, three weeks is a long time to wait for that [inaudible] immigration.\nThis is Doral, it was built by...\nDonald Trump. Well, Doral is great. And Doral\u2014I think I have over 1,000 Hispanics working at Doral, and they're doing a great job.\nYes, ma'am, in the yellow, go ahead. Yellow.\nQuestion. I have another question.\nDonald Trump. Excuse me. Yellow.\nQuestion. Hillary Clinton's running mate...\nDonald Trump. Who?\nQuestion. Hillary Clinton's running mate speaks Spanish. Do you think this [inaudible] an advantage on...\nDonald Trump. No, I don't think it has any impact. He's been very bad\u2014her running mate has been very, very bad on employment. And all you have to do is go to Virginia and speak to the people of Virginia, he has been so bad.\nI figured when she chose him, he was very popular in Virginia. They don't like him. They don't like him. It has been very close races, and his polling is very bad.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I think it's time for Hillary Clinton to do a news conference, because it's almost a year now and it would be interesting to see how she does.\nThank you all very much.\nQuestion. [inaudible] running for the president [inaudible]?\nDonald Trump. Might as well tell him to have a good time. He has done one bad job.\nOK, thank you, everybody.\n","132":"\nFriends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\nOur Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\nAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.\nI have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u2013 and I mean very soon \u2013 come to an end.\nBeginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.\nThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.\nIt is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\nI will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\nSo if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.\nBut here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\nThese are the facts:\nDecades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.\nHomicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.\nIn the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\nThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\nOne such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\nI've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?\nAgain, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\nHousehold incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone. We're going to fix that.\nThe budget is no better.\nPresident Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\nNow let us consider the state of affairs abroad.\nNot only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.\nThis was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing \u2013 it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria \u2013 and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.\nIn Libya, our consulate \u2013 the symbol of American prestige around the globe \u2013 was brought down in flames. America is far less safe \u2013 and the world is far less stable \u2013 than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.\nLet's defeat her in November, OK.\nI am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment \u2013 something pointed out by Bernie Sanders \u2013 are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.\nIn 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control.\nAfter four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.\nBut Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now \u2013 poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u2013 will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\nThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect, the respect we deserve.\nThe American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home \u2013 which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.\nA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it's for their benefit.\nBig business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.\nThat is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change...never ever. My message is that things have to change \u2013 and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.\nI have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.\nI am your voice!\nI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.\n[disruption in the audience]\nHow great are our police? And how great is Cleveland?\nI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\nWhen innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws \u2013 or still worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash \u2013 I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way.\nAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence \u2013 I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.\nWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was \"extremely careless\" and \"negligent,\" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes.\nIn fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it \u2013 especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.\nI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders \u2013 he never had a chance.\nBut his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs, and strip us of our wealth as a country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.\nWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.\nAmerica was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.\nOn Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me, believe me.\nI will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.\nThe irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.\nThis Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember: it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them at every level.\nWhen I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.\nEvery action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child.\nTo make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we are going to defeat them fast.\nOnce again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.\nThe damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over \u2013 at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations.\nOnly weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community \u2013 no good and we're going to stop it.\nAs your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology \u2013 beleive me.\nAnd as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.\nTo protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.\nWe must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.\nThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.\nRecently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.\nLastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.\nMy opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this. Think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.\nI only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.\nDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve. We have to solve it.\nThese families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain, believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine, and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh, it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so so horribly?\nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.\nWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.\nBy ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.\nTonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied \u2013 and every politician who has denied them \u2013 to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say.\nOn January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.\nBut my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nMy plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.\nYet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class.\nI have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many. It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\nI have made billions of dollars in business making deals \u2013 now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the richest people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nRemember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or, frankly, any other country.\nNever, ever again.\nI am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America \u2013 and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.\nMy opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization \u2013 another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.\nShe supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. I will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America fist, again! America first! Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.\nNo longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long \u2013 and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.\nThis includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America \u2013 and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want.\nWe are going to start building and making things again.\nNext comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year \u2013 Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone.\nAmerica is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it will happen, and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.\nMy opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business \u2013 that will never happen with Donald Trump as President. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.\nThis new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans \u2013 We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\nMy opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing, and that's what she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster!\nThank you. Thank you.\nWe are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.\nWe will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.\nWe will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying.\nMy opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread \u2013 one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.\nWe are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\nThe replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\nAt this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what, the support they have given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. So true. They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.\nI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else \u2013 all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back \u2013 bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\nIn this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job? My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.\nIt's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.\nThen there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.\nTo my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.\nBut now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country \u2013 to go to work for all of you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.\nAmerica is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\nRemember: All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people that wouldn't stand -- I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Love it, love it, love it. No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.\nHistory is watching us now.\nIt's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.\nMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: \"I'm With Her\". I choose to recite a different pledge.\nMy pledge reads: \"I'M WITH YOU \u2013 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\"\nI am your voice.\nSo to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nTo all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nGod bless you, and good night! I love you!\n","133":"\nThank you, everybody. Great honor. Great honor, thank you. This is a wonderful day. Aww. [Chants of Trump, Trump, Trump] Wow.\u00a0 On a Saturday morning yet. Isn't that nice? Thank you, all. And we're going to have an incredible convention. It's really going well. We're going to have an incredible convention. And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly.\nSo I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system -- we are in a rigged, rigged system -- and to make America safe again and to make America great again.\nI want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France. We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look. And now it's happening more and more. And it's never going to stop.\nWe need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need in our country law and order. And if I'm elected president, that will happen. [applause]\nI want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation.\nAnd as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people. We wish them well. It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well. A lot of -- a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out.\nNow, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years. The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control. After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path. He didn't know what he was doing.\nIraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end. Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems.\nWe also need to bring back in this country -- because we see what happened -- our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs. They've been taken away, like we're babies. Taken away. And we're going to bring them back.\nI found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous -- really prosperous society for all Americans. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana. And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute.\nBut I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person. [applause]\nGovernor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration. It's horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it's out of control.\nMike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She's a corrupt person. What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She's crooked Hillary. [applause]\nAnd I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails -- but it wasn't a loss, she discarded -- that in itself is a major crime. Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.\nThirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK? Didn't give them to the FBI? Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK? Wipes her server clean, that's OK? These are crimes. These are crimes. And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't.\nBut I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around. She's going to pay it at the polls. I believe that. [applause]\nOn top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time. She's totally owned by Wall Street. We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism. And it's not that she believes in it. The people that give her all of this money believe in it. And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe. Believe me. That's it. [applause]\nWhat a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence. [applause]\nMike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam. Radical Islamic terrorism. You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window. You heard what he was screaming out the window. You saw it in San Bernardino. You saw it at the World Trade Center. You saw it in Orlando. How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris. You see it all over.\nAnd Hillary is a weak person. We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party. We're going to change things around. There's going to be respect again for law and order. [applause]\nHillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS. You know, she's talking -- I see the ads she puts on. If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests. Got a lot of money.\nBut I see the ads on foreign policy. She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience. Of course not. I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson. I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq. Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson. I was a civilian. Take the oil. Many, many calls I've made.\nYou take a look. I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen. I was the one that predicted it. And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong. President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win. I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do. And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from.\nAnd I said that Brexit's going to happen. I said that they are going to break away. And everybody laughed at me. And the odds were 20 percent. And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen. And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right. I appreciate that. Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK.\nSo Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy. So important. Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. Because I'm an outsider. I want to be an outsider. I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides. I won in landslides. This wasn't close. This wasn't close. [applause]\nNo, this wasn't close. This was -- in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three. There were 17. We got -- I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger -- I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes. That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president.\nThink of it. That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love. That's more than Richard Nixon. It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness. Pretty good. It's more than the Bushes.\nBut I mean by a lot. I don't mean by a little. But that's with 17 people. People don't over-say that. That means our message is unbelievable. And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing.\nBut they displayed it. It was on display, where we had this group of people, who -- many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK? Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump. Oh, we're going to win. They got crushed. And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen.\nThey're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers. We're going to put 'em back to work. [applause]\nSo they're very tired of it. But I want to thank all of those people that \u2013 delegates-- that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something. Did we show them something. And unfortunately, the vote was very late. But essentially, we had 112-12. This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight. We're not going to have a fight. People agree with what we've -- they want the wall. They want the borders. They want these things to happen.\nAnd what we're doing... [applause]\nAnd what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it. We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination. The evangelicals have been unbelievable. I dominated with the evangelicals. A lot of people were surprised. They say he's not perfect. But you know what? They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart. [applause]\nAnd I said -- and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do. You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group. And he was a powerful president. He knew how to get things done. He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him. But he was a powerful president.\nAnd we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status. We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment. And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.\nI saw this. I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid?\nAnd they didn't know how to answer the question. And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out. One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues. We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political.\nAnd I looked out the window. I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street. I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't. That means they're more powerful than you are. We have to do something about it. How did it start? How did it start? [applause]\nAnd they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson. And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader. And he did this, and he got it done. And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away. And we're going to change that. OK? All right. [applause]\nBack to Mike Pence. So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big. Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall. That's where Trump was going down -- they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places. But Indiana was going to be the firewall.\nSo I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before. NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country. Manufacturing down in some states 55, 60 percent. It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places.\nI have a friend who's a great builder. What he builds is plants. That's all he does, is build plants. He doesn't build buildings. He doesn't -- he builds plants. It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear.\nI said, how's business? I was with him the other day. How's business? He goes unbelievable. I said, really, wow, I'm surprised. Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country. He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe. I said, what do you mean? He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen.\nI said, what about this country? Not much. Not much. That's the expression. He said exactly that. Not much. I said, but Mexico? He said, you've never seen anything like it. It's incredible.\nFolks, that's going to stop. We're going to go reverse it. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country. We can't be the stupid people anymore. OK? [applause]\nAnd he was better than a pollster. He's better than a consultant. I would say, how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars. Doesn't cost me millions. Me, I give them $10,000, OK? [laughter]\nIt costs other people millions. It costs other campaigns millions to get a report. Every time they get a report, it's millions. But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report. And he said it. He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it. Just fact. How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico. In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it.\nAnd if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan. We want them to build them in Michigan. They're going to build them in Michigan. And you know that I know how to do that. So easy. So easy.\nBut they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution. There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here. There are consequences. And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country. It's very simple. And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike. [laughter]\nIndiana's unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing. [applause]\nIncredible family. Highly respected. Expected to go for another four years. He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana. Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen. When he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states. I've gone to all of them. And every time, I have statisticians. I say give me the stats on a state.\nAnd it's always bad, down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here's somebody where it's gone up. Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013. That's like very unusual.\nGovernor Pence balanced the budget. Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing. We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion. He balanced the budget. They don't know what that means. Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.\nIt's also rated triple-A, their bonds are rated triple-A. Very few states have that. Triple-A. The best. That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, triple-A.\nIndiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it's not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana.\nAnd besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor.\nIndiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind. [applause]\nIf you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said the, really -- they're doing much better, the V.A. is much better. They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for. People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on -- they can't even see a doctor. It's a scandal.\nTake a look at what's happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what's happening with -- you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It's a scandal. It's corrupt. It's incompetent. It's a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact. [applause]\nSo it's now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best. Got 'em jobs. Got 'em jobs.\nIndianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That's a great thing. They're going to stay there. That's a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy.\nUnder Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the state's history. So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education. Isn't that a great thing? [applause]\nIndiana has just about the largest school choice program in America. School choice is where it's at, folks. You want to get your schools better, you gotta get rid of Common Core fast.\nGovernor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history. Think of that. We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets. And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country. CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure.\nSo with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up. That had so much -- look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump. I build infrastructure. Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure?\nYou know, it's very interesting. We're building -- we're building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing -- probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services. And I really like what's happened. We're going to have an opening very soon. Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it.\nBut I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year \u2013 but we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially. And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do. [applause]\nAnd when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before. They've never heard them.\nSo when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work -- also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke -- who's now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country.\nThe turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there. And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide. And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember. He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted -- who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy -- but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump. I said, who did he endorse?\nSo even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non-endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK? I will tell you. [applause]\nSo with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]\n","134":"\nThank you.\nI'd like to thank Chairman Jeff Miller for his leadership on behalf of those who have served this country in military uniform, and for working with our campaign on developing real solutions for our great Veterans.\nBefore going further today, however, I would first like to address the contributions of another group who serve this country in uniform: the men and women in blue.\nOur Police Officers rush into danger every day to protect our communities, and they often do it thanklessly and under relentless criticism.\nThey save thousands of lives every year, perform countless public services every day, and yet their names will likely never appear in a single headline or media report.\nBut I want our nation's police to know, that we thank you, and we support you, and we will always stand with you.\nThe attack on our Dallas police is an attack on our country.\nOur whole nation is in mourning, and will be for a very long time.\nYet, we've also seen increasing threats against our police and a substantial rise in the number of officers killed in the line of duty.\nAmerica's police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos \u2013 and the destruction of our country as we know it.\nWe must remember, the police are needed the most where crime is the highest. Politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable Americans.\nIt is time for the hostility against our police, and against all members of law enforcement, to end \u2013 and to end right now.\nWe went through an ugly chapter in our history, during Vietnam, when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas. For too many police today, that is their daily reality.\nAt the same time, the tragic deaths in Louisiana and Minnesota make clear the work that must be done to ensure every American feels that their safety is protected. We were all disturbed by the images we saw.\nWe must discuss, as well, the ongoing catastrophe of crime in our inner cities. According to the Chicago Tribune, there has already been more than 2,000 shooting victims in Chicago this year alone. This epidemic of violence destroys lives, destroys communities, and destroys opportunity for young Americans.\nViolent crime has increased in cities across America. The New York Times described \"a startling rise in murders,\" in our major cities.\nBrutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into Virginia and Maryland.\nToo many Americans are trapped in fear, violence and poverty.\nOur inner cities have been left behind, and I am going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home, safe school and safe community.\nWe must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country.\nI am the law and order candidate.\nHillary Clinton, on the other hand, is weak, ineffective, pandering, and, as proven by her recent email scandal, which was an embarrassment not only to her, but to the nation as a whole, she is either a liar or grossly incompetent.\nPersonally, I think she is both.\nNot only am I the law and order candidate, but I am also the candidate of compassion. But you can't have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of the United States. Every kid in America should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood.\nEveryone will be protected equally and treated justly, without prejudice.\nWe will be tough, we will be smart, we will be fair \u2013 and we will protect all Americans.\nWithout safety, we have nothing!\nIt is the job of the next President to Make America Safe Again \u2014 For Everyone.\nThat promise of protection must include taking care of every last Veteran, which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the attack in Dallas.\nThe men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of America.\nNow is the time to follow their example of unity, public service and selfless devotion to our country.\nWe made a promise to these heroes. You defend America, and America will defend you.\nBut that promise has been broken by our politicians, like so many other promises our country has made \u2013 not only to its veterans, but to its citizens as a whole.\nPresident Obama has allowed our Veterans Affairs health care system to deny help and support to those who deserve it most.\nHillary Clinton recently said of the VA scandal that \"it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be.\"\nShe actually thinks that the Veterans Health Administration is well run \u2013 that's because she has been part of the rigged system.\nPerhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives \u2013 instead of spending time with real people in real pain.\nThe disconnect in America is deep.\nThere are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else.\nThe VA scandals that have occurred on this Administration's watch are widespread and inexcusable.\nAn internal memo from a senior VA official describes \"lawlessness and chaos,\" at the Veterans Health Administration, including the payments of $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules.\nThe memo also says they \"waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws\" and warns that \"these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to America's Veterans.\"\nEven the White House's own Deputy Chief of Staff described \"significant and chronic systemic failures,\" in Veterans Affairs, including \"a corrosive culture that has led to personnel problems across the Department,\" with \"poor management,\" and \"a history of retaliation toward employees raising issues.\" He said there is a \"lack of accountability across all grade levels.\"\nHere are just a few examples:\n--Forty veterans died waiting for care in Phoenix.\n--Forty different VA facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times.\n--A VA employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff, as was a convicted sex offender.\n--The VA spent $8 million on solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be torn down.\n--The St. Cloud, Minn. VA built a $2.3 million wind turbine in April 2011 that hasn't supplied power since 2012.\nCan you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full investigation in January of 2017?\nMost of those responsible have still not been held to account.\nFixing this corruption will be one of my highest priorities \u2013 and it will happen. It will be fixed.\nThat begins with a simple promise: every Veteran will get timely access to top-quality care\nVeterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center.\nWe must extend this right to all Veterans\u2013 not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days, or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is the current policy.\nThis promise includes guaranteed access to the best available healthcare services for our female Veterans.\nWe must also do more to help our Veterans find jobs\nEvery year, large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas, and across the border, to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our Veterans.\nVeterans should come first in the country they fought to protect, and under a Trump Administration they will -- America First, Veterans First.\nVeterans' health care must also include the best mental health care.\nA shocking 20 Veterans are committing suicide each day, especially our older Veterans.\nThis is a national tragedy.\nThe evidence shows that if Veterans are in the system, receiving care, they are much less likely to take their own lives than Veterans outside the system.\nThat is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the VA \u2013 while ensuring that Veterans can access private mental health care as well.\nAmerica must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large. This includes expanding the number of facilities, integrating primary care and mental care professionals, reforming confinement rules, and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones the care they need \u2013 especially in emergencies.\nOne of the most important reforms we can make is accountability\nRight now, when VA employees fail our Veterans, you can't discipline them.\nThat's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform.\nIn fact, employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions.\nIn 2014, the VA awarded $142 million in bonuses to its employees, including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the Denver VA hospital that was more than $1 billion over budget.\nTwo other VA executives even abused their authority to obtain $400,000 in relocation benefits.\nIt doesn't have to be this way.\nAs Veteran Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said: \"The VA is not sacred. The Veteran is.\"\nHere is my 10 step plan to ensure quality, timely care for every Veteran in America:\nOne:\nI will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the VA.\nThe Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our Veterans \u2013 not bureaucrats, not politicians, but Veterans. Amazingly, President Obama's VA Secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at Disneyland.\nTwo:\nI am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail our Veterans or breach the public trust.\nThree:\nI am going to ask Congress to pass legislation that ensures the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health, safety or well-being of any Veteran.\nFour:\nI am going to appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for bold legislative reform.\nFive:\nI am going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the VA have their jobs protected, and are put in line for promotions.\nSix:\nI will create a private White House Hotline \u2013 that is answered by a real person 24 hours a day \u2013 to ensure that no valid complaint about VA wrongdoing falls through the cracks.\nI will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me, and I will pick up the phone and fix it myself, if need be.\nThat's a promise.\nSeven:\nWe are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money, and start giving bonuses to people for improving service, saving lives and cutting waste.\nIf an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates better outcomes for our Veterans, then a small, responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to taxpayers.\nEight:\nWe are going to reform our visa programs to ensure American Veterans are in the front, not back, of the line.\nNine:\nWe are going to increase the number of mental health care professionals, and increase outreach to Veterans outside of the system.\nTen:\nWe are going to ensure every Veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the VA, or to seek private medical care paid for by our government.\nNever again will we allow a Veteran to suffer or die waiting for the care they so richly deserve.\nWe need to clean out the corruption in Government, and Hillary Clinton will never be able to do it\nShe is incompetent, and has proven that time and time again.\nCrooked Hillary Clinton is the Secretary of the Status Quo \u2013 and wherever Hillary Clinton goes, corruption and scandal follow.\nOur country needs change, and she will never give us change.\nThe fact is, she helped create our rigged system.\nHillary Clinton's America is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment.\nThe rigged system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of America at risk.\nHillary Clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and to bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials.\nIn other words, she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading her emails as long as the voting American public could not.\nHer conduct was willful, intentional, and unlawful \u2013 and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware of her guilt.\nThis was not just extreme carelessness with classified material \u2013 which is still totally disqualifying. This is calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct \u2013 followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to Congress, the media and the American people.\nIn fact, when the FBI interviewed her for only 3 hours during the 4th of July weekend, her interview was not recorded, and she was, amazingly, not even put under oath.\nShe carried out her dangerous email scheme at the same time as her bad judgement and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing ISIS across the world.\nAfterwards, as a further demonstration of guilt, Hillary Clinton erased more than thirty thousand emails as part of the cover-up.\nThe fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment.\nWhen thinking about her e-mail destruction, let's not forget: many foreign and corporate entities, and other special interests, with business before Hillary Clinton's State Department were making massive financial contributions. These contributions were made to both the Clinton Foundation and to the Clintons directly.\nIf elected, Hillary Clinton would become the first President of the United States who wouldn't be able to pass a background check.\nJust look at what the FBI Director said about her \u2013 her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.\nClearly, Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.\nThe decades of decay, division and decline will come to an end.\nThe years of American Greatness will return.\nWe are going to become, for the first time in a long time, one united country.\nWe are going to make American Great Again \u2013 And Safe Again \u2013 For All Americans.\nWe will dream big and bold and daring things once more.\nLet me conclude by paying tribute to every single American hero who has served this country, and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.\nOur debt to them is eternal and everlasting.\nWe are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for us.\nWe will be a safe, strong, and proud country once again.\nThank you.\n","135":"\nToday I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.\nPeople have asked me why I am running for President.\nI have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.\nWe come to work together and turn visions into reality.\nWe think big, and then we make it happen.\nI love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.\nSo when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.\nWhen I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton \u2013 only by me.\nThe fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!\nEverywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.\nWe will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.\nThe insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.\nThat's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.\nBecause it's not just the political system that's rigged. It's the whole economy.\nIt's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.\nIt's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.\nIt's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.\nIt's rigged against you, the American people.\nHillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar \u2013\njust look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.\nBrian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.\nYesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.\nI am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.\nWe are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.\nThis election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.\nHere is my promise to the American voter:\nIf I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.\nThe other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests \u2013 and taking money from special interests.\nHillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.\nShe ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund \u2013 doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.\nThen, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests \u2013 in less than 2 years \u2013 secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.\nTogether, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.\nThey totally own her, and that will never change.\nThe choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.\nThose are the stakes.\nHillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.\nShe believes she is entitled to the office.\nHer campaign slogan is \"I'm with her.\"\nYou know what my response to that is? I'm with you: the American people.\nShe thinks it's all about her.\nI know it's all about you \u2013 I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.\nOur country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.\nWe got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism \u2013 focusing on what's good for America's middle class \u2013 to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.\nWe reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.\nThis is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.\nThis is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.\nWe need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.\nThat's what we mean by America First.\nOur country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.\nOur Founders understood this.\nOne of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for \"the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]\" in America.\nOur first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:\n\"The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\"\nI have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nHillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.\nWe've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.\nOur trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.\nThen she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property \u2013 a crime which is continuing to this day.\nHillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.\nIn return, Hillary Clinton got rich!\nThe book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.\nShe gets rich making you poor.\nHere is a quote from the book: \"At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton\u2026at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.\"\nThese funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.\nShe sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.\nHillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas \u2013 and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.\nNow, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book \u2013 deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)\nBut this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career \u2013 and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.\nI want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.\nWe don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.\nIt's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.\nThe Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars \u2013 and unleashed ISIS across the world.\nNo Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.\nHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.\nAmong the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.\nAmbassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.\nHillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.\nShe started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.\nTo cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.\nHere is what one of the victim's mothers had to say:\n\"I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president.\"\nIn 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.\nLibya was cooperating.\nIraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\nSyria was under control.\nIran was being choked by sanctions.\nEgypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.\nISIS wasn't even on the map.\nFast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed\nto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.\nHer invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.\nThanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.\nHillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen \u2013 while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.\nShe helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.\nThen, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.\nISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.\nISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality \u2013 and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.\nIn short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.\nIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.\nThough I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.\nBut Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.\nShe lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.\nIn the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:\n\"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office\u2026from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true\u2026Her leadership style \u2013 volcanic, impulsive\u2026disdainful of the rules set for everyone else \u2013 hasn't changed a bit.\"\nPerhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.\nUnder her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth \u2013 with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.\nAlready, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.\nThe father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.\nI only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.\nHillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.\nMaybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.\nHillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.\nHere is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:\nA foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.\nHillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.\nHillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access \u2013 even though he had no national security credentials.\nHillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State \u2013 plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance.\nHillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.\nHillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.\nTo cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.\nHer server was easily hacked by foreign governments \u2013 perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China \u2013 putting all of America in danger.\nThen there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.\nWhile we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.\nSo they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.\nThis fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.\nWe can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.\nNational security is also immigration security \u2013 and Hillary wants neither.\nHillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.\nShe has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.\nThe first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.\nLet me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.\nShe lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.\nSadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.\nHere is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter:\n\"Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way \u2013 an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.\"\nHillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.\nFor the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.\nHillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.\nHere are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:\nAppoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.\nChange immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs\nStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many\nCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas\nLift restrictions on energy production\nRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.\nPass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.\nImpose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.\nThere is one common theme in all of these reforms.\nIt's going to be America First.\nThis is why the stakes in November are so great.\nOn Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.\nThe voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.\nCome November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.\nThey will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.\nHillary Clinton's message is old and tired. Her message is that can't change.\nMy message is that things have to change \u2013 and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.\nAmericans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.\nThen we started thinking small.\nWe stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.\nWe lost our sense of purpose, and daring.\nBut that's not who we are.\nCome this November, we can bring America back \u2013 bigger and better, and stronger than ever.\nWe will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth \u2013 the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.\nOur military will have the best technology and finest equipment \u2013 we will bring it back all the way.\nMassive new factories will come roaring into our country \u2013 breathing life and hope into our communities.\nInner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.\nConstruction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.\nThe real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.\nWe are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.\nI am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.\nOur country is going to start working again.\nPeople are going to start working again.\nParents are going to start dreaming big for their children again \u2013 including parents in our inner cities.\nAmericans are going to start believing in the future or our country.\nWe are going to make America rich again.\nWe are going to make America safe again.\nWe are going to make America Great Again \u2013 and Great Again For EVERYONE.\n","136":"\nThank you for joining me today.\nThis was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.\nEven her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.\nThere will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.\nBut today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.\nThe attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country's history.\nSo many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.\nThe horror is beyond description.\nThe families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.\nWe express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.\nWe mourn, as one people, for our nation's loss \u2013 and pledge our support to any and all who need it.\nI would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.\n[SILENCE]\nOur nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.\nThis is a very dark moment in America's history.\nA radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.\nIt is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.\nIt is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.\nIt is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.\nWe need to respond to this attack on America as one united people \u2013 with force, purpose and determination.\nBut the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.\nIf we don't get tough, and we don't get smart \u2013 and fast \u2013 we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.\nThe killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don't share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.\nThe bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.\nThat is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.\nWe have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.\nWe have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.\nWith fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.\nI called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.\nThe immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.\nI will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.\nAfter a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.\nWe cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.\nMany of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.\nRadical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.\nI refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.\nIt's not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.\nIf we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans \u2013 women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people \u2013 then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.\nWe need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.\nWe are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.\nEven our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.\nAll of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.\nLarge numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.\nThe Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.\nThe male shooter in San Bernardino \u2013 again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife \u2013 the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.\nImmigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.\nWe admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.\nIf we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.\nYet, Hillary Clinton \u2013 for months and despite so many attacks \u2013 repeatedly refused to even say the words \"radical Islam,\" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.\nHowever, Hillary Clinton \u2013 who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage \u2013 still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is.\nShe is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.\nIn fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: \"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\"\nHillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.\nI will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.\nThe bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.\nWhen it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss \u2013 it's deadly.\nThe Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.\nI refuse to be politically correct.\nI will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.\nThe days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.\nAs President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.\nWe need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials \u2013 and with our allies.\nI will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism \u2013 and who will have the support they require to get the job done.\nWe also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.\nThe Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.\nNearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.\nThese Departments refused to comply.\nPresident Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9\/11.\nThe public has a right to know how these people got here.\nWe have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.\nWe have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.\nEven a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?\nTruly, our President doesn't know what he is doing. He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.\nEach year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.\nIn fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.\nHaving learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.\nThis could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.\nWe can't let this happen.\nAltogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.\nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.\nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.\nThe burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.\nWouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?\nWe have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States \u2013 we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.\nWhat I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.\nThat is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.\nWe've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.\nAsk yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country\u2014they enslave women, and murder gays.\nI don't want them in our country.\nThe terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.\nIn San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.\nWe need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.\nWe need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.\nWe need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.\nWe need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan \u2013 including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us \u2013 is brought to justice.\nIf it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .\nAmerica must do more \u2013 much more \u2013 to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.\nIt also means we must change our foreign policy.\nThe decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.\nThese actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.\nThat is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.\nFor instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.\nI've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.\nAmerica must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.\nWe've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.\nI'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.\nWhen I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.\nAmerica will be a tolerant and open society.\nAmerica will also be a safe society.\nWe will protect our borders at home.\nWe will defeat ISIS overseas.\nWe will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.\nWe will make America rich again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nWe will make American Great Again.\nThank you.\nThe media talks about \"homegrown,\" terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.\nYes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.\nFor instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.\nThis shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?\nHillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn't share their views.\nShe can't have it both ways. She can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.\nHow does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?\nWhy does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here\u2014in vast numbers\u2014who reject our values?\nImmigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities \u2013 all of our communities.\nAmerica has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.\nNot surprisingly, wages for our workers haven't budged in many years.\nSo whether it's matter of national security, or financial security, we can't afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.\nAll our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.\nI want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad \u2013 and they do know where they are.\nI want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.\nI want to protect our citizens \u2013 all of our citizens.\n","137":"\nWow.

Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you San Diego for that warm, warm welcome and thanks to Ellen for those moving words, her introduction, and for reminding us it's not only our men and women in uniform that serve our country, it's their families, their spouses, their children, and we are grateful to each and every one of them. I want to recognize and thank Congressman Scott Peters for being here, thank you very much.\nAnd all of the other electeds and service members, active duty and retired National Guard and Reservists, veterans, military spouses, family members, all who are with us today.\nOn Monday, we observed Memorial Day \u2013 a day that means a great deal to San Diego, home of so many active-duty and former military and their families. We honor the sacrifice of those who died for our country in many ways \u2013 by living our values, by making this a stronger and fairer nation, and by carrying out a smart and principled foreign policy.\nThat's what I want to speak about today \u2013 the challenges we face in protecting our country, and the choice at stake in this election.\nIt's a choice between a fearful America that's less secure and less engaged with the world, and a strong, confident America that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing.\nAs Secretary of State, Senator and First Lady, I had the honor of representing America abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home. As a candidate for President, there's nothing I take more seriously than our national security. I've offered clear strategies for how to defeat ISIS, strengthen our alliances, and make sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. And I'm going to keep America's security at the heart of my campaign.\nBecause as you know so well, Americans aren't just electing a President in November. We're choosing our next commander-in-chief \u2013 the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace, life and death.\nAnd like many across our country and around the world, I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for President cannot do the job.\nDonald Trump's ideas aren't just different \u2013 they are dangerously incoherent. They're not even really ideas \u2013 just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies.\nHe is not just unprepared \u2013 he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.\nThis is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes \u2013 because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\nWe cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.\nThis is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia.\nThis is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO \u2013 the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home.\nHe believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008.\nHe has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists \u2013 even though those are war crimes.\nHe says he doesn't have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has \u2013 quote \u2013\u00a0'a very good brain.'\nHe also said, 'I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.'\u00a0You know what? I don't believe him.\nHe says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren't heroes.\nHe praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends \u2013 including the British prime minister, the mayor of London, the German chancellor, the president of Mexico and the Pope.\nHe says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia.\nAnd to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are \u2013 and I quote \u2013 a\u00a0'third-world country.'\u00a0And he's been saying things like that for decades.\nThose are the words my friends of someone who doesn't understand America or the world.\nAnd they're the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction. Because if you really believe America is weak \u2013 with our military, our values, our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching \u2013 then you don't know America.\nAnd you certainly don't deserve to lead it.\nThat's why \u2013 even if I weren't in this race \u2013 I'd be doing everything I could to make sure Donald Trump never becomes President \u2013 because I believe he will take our country down a truly dangerous path.\nUnlike him, I have some experience with the tough calls and the hard work of statecraft. I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen, brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia, twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against Iran, and stood up for the rights of women, religious minorities and LGBT people around the world.\nAnd I have, I have sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the toughest choices he faced.\nSo I'm not new to this work. And I'm proud to run on my record, because I think the choice before the American people in this election is clear.\nI believe in strong alliances; clarity in dealing with our rivals; and a rock-solid commitment to the values that have always made America great. And I believe with all my heart that America is an exceptional country \u2013 that we're still, in Lincoln's words, the last, best hope of earth. We are not a country that cowers behind walls. We lead with purpose, and we prevail.\nAnd if America doesn't lead, we leave a vacuum \u2013 and that will either cause chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void. Then they'll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety \u2013 and trust me, the choices they make will not be to our benefit.\nThat is not an outcome we can live with.\nAs I see it, there are some important things our next President must do to secure American leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead. These are all areas in which Donald Trump and I profoundly disagree. And they are all critical to our future.\nFirst, we need to be strong at home.\nThat means investing in our infrastructure, education and innovation \u2013 the fundamentals of a strong economy. We need to reduce income inequality, because our country can't lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families. And we need to break down the barriers that hold Americans back, including barriers of bigotry and discrimination.\nCompare that with what Trump wants to do. His economic plans would add more than $30 trillion \u2013 that's trillion with a\u00a0'T'\u00a0\u2013 $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years. He has no ideas on education. No ideas on innovation. He has a lot of ideas about who to blame, but no clue about what to do.\nNone of what Donald Trump is offering will make America stronger at home. And that would make us weaker in the world.\nSecond, we need to stick with our allies.\nAmerica's network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional. And our allies deliver for us every day.\nOur armed forces fight terrorists together; our diplomats work side by side. Allies provide staging areas for our military, so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world. And they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats.\nTake the threat posed by North Korea \u2013 perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet, run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the United States.\nWhen I was Secretary of State, we worked closely with our allies Japan and South Korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead, should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us. The technology is ours. Key parts of it are located on Japanese ships. All three countries contributed to it. And this month, all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to test it.\nThat's the power of allies.\nAnd it's the legacy of American troops who fought and died to secure those bonds, because they knew we were safer with friends and partners.\nNow Moscow and Beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the world, because they have nothing to match them. They'd love for us to elect a President who would jeopardize that source of strength. If Donald gets his way, they'll be celebrating in the Kremlin. We cannot let that happen.\nThat's why it is no small thing when he talks about leaving NATO, or says he'll stay neutral on Israel's security.\nIt's no small thing when he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers. We're lucky to have two friendly neighbors on our land borders. Why would he want to make one of them an enemy?\nAnd it's no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons, and said this about a war between Japan and North Korea \u2013 and I quote \u2013\u00a0'If they do, they do. Good luck, enjoy yourself, folks.'\u00a0I wonder if he even realizes he's talking about nuclear war.\nYes, our friends need to contribute their fair share. I made that point long before Donald Trump came onto the scene \u2013 and a number of them have increased their defense spending. The real debate here is whether we keep these alliances strong or cut them off. What he says would weaken our country.\nThird, we need to embrace all the tools of American power, especially diplomacy and development, to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home.\nDiplomacy is often the only way to avoid a conflict that could end up exacting a much greater cost. It takes patience, persistence and an eye on the long game \u2013 but it's worth it.\nTake the nuclear agreement with Iran. When President Obama took office, Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb. Some called for military action. But that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict.\nPresident Obama chose a different path. And I got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions. We brought Iran to the table. We began talks. And eventually, we reached an agreement that should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.\nNow we must enforce that deal vigorously. And as I've said many times before, our approach must be\u00a0'distrust and verify.'\u00a0The world must understand that the United States will act decisively if necessary, including with military action, to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. In particular, Israel's security is non-negotiable. They're our closest ally in the region, and we have a moral obligation to defend them.\nBut there is no question that the world and the United States, we are safer now than we were before this agreement. And we accomplished it without firing a single shot, dropping a single bomb or putting a single American soldier in harm's way.\nDonald Trump says we shouldn't have done the deal. We should have walked away. But that would have meant no more global sanctions, and Iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us. So then what? War? Telling the world, good luck, you deal with Iran?\nOf course Trump doesn't have answers to those questions. Donald Trump doesn't know the first thing about Iran or its nuclear program. Ask him. It'll become very clear, very quickly.\nThere's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal.\nBut it doesn't work like that in world affairs. Just like being interviewed on the same episode of \"60 Minutes\" as Putin was, is not the same thing as actually dealing with Putin.\nSo the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels. We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table \u2013 bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets \u2013 I'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now.\nBut those tools won't do the trick. Rather than solving global crises, he would create new ones.\nHe has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind. In fact, he is downright contemptuous of that work. And that means he's much more likely to end up leading us into conflict.\nFourth, we need to be firm but wise with our rivals.\nCountries like Russia and China often work against us. Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets. That hurts American workers. Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine, right on NATO's doorstep. Now I've gone toe-to-toe with Russia and China, and many other different leaders around the world. So I know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must, and find common ground when we can.\nThat's how I could work with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and with China to increase pressure on North Korea. It's how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change, which Trump now wants to rip up.\nThe key was never forgetting who we were dealing with \u2013 not friends or allies, but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements.\nDonald doesn't see the complexity. He wants to start a trade war with China. And I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements \u2013 I do too. But a trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful. Combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt, and it's not hard to see how a Trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis.\nAnd I have to say, I don't understand Donald's bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength. He said,\u00a0'You've got to give Kim Jong Un credit'\u00a0for taking over North Korea \u2013 something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat, including his own uncle, which Donald described gleefully, like he was recapping an action movie. And he said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader, he'd give him an 'A.'\nNow, I'll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants.\nI just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America's real friends are. Because it matters. If you don't know exactly who you're dealing with, men like Putin will eat your lunch.\nFifth, we need a real plan for confronting terrorists.\nAs we saw six months ago in San Bernardino, the threat is real and urgent. Over the past year, I've laid out my plans for defeating ISIS.\nWe need to take out their strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground. We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syria's civil war and close Iraq's sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping ISIS alive. We need to lash up with our allies, and ensure our intelligence services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that supplies money, arms, propaganda and fighters to the terrorists. We need to win the battle in cyberspace.\nAnd of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home.\nThat \u2013 in a nutshell \u2013 is my plan for defeating ISIS.\nWhat's Trump's? Well he won't say. He is literally keeping it a secret. The secret, of course, is he has no idea what he'd do to stop ISIS.\nJust look at the few things he's actually said on the subject.\nHe's actually said \u2013 and I quote \u2013'maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.'\u00a0Oh, okay \u2013 let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the Middle East.\nThen he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS.\nHe also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS, which would mean mass civilian casualties.\nIt's clear he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. So we can't be certain which of these things he would do. But we can be certain that he's capable of doing any or all of them. Letting ISIS run wild. Launching a nuclear attack. Starting a ground war. These are all distinct possibilities with Donald Trump in charge.\nAnd through all his loose talk, there's one constant theme: demonizing Muslims and playing right into the hands of ISIS'. His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from even coming to our country doesn't just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on. It's also a huge propaganda victory for ISIS. And it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight.\nA Trump Presidency would embolden ISIS. We cannot take that risk.\nThis isn't reality television \u2013 this is actual reality.\nAnd defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans. It takes a real plan, real experience and real leadership. Donald Trump lacks all three.\nAnd one more thing. A President has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must, and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy. Our troops give their all. They deserve a commander-in-chief who knows that.\nI've worked side-by-side with admirals and generals, and visited our troops in theaters of war. I've fought for better health care for our National Guard, better services for our veterans, and more support for our Gold Star families. We cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in Donald Trump's hands.\nSixth, we need to stay true to our values.\nTrump says over and over again,\u00a0'The world is laughing at us.'\u00a0He's been saying\u00a0this for decades, he didn't just start this year.\nHe bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987, when Ronald Reagan was President, saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 laughing at us. He was wrong then, and he's wrong now \u2013 and you've got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America, and has felt that way for at least 30 years, wants to be our President.\nThe truth is, there's not a country in the world that can rival us. It's not just that we have the greatest military, or that our economy is larger, more durable, more entrepreneurial than any in the world. It's also that Americans work harder, dream bigger \u2013 and we never, ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place.\nSo it really matters that Donald Trump says things that go against our deepest-held values. It matters when he says he'll order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists. During the raid to kill bin Laden, when every second counted, our SEALs took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety. Donald Trump may not get it, but that's what honor looks like.\nAnd it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people, calls women pigs,proposes banning an entire religion from our country, or plays coy with white supremacists. America stands up to countries that treat women like animals, or people of different races, religions or ethnicities as less human.\nWhat happens to the moral example we set \u2013 for the world and for our own children \u2013 if our President engages in bigotry?\nAnd by the way, Mr. Trump \u2013 every time you insult American Muslims or Mexican immigrants, remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces.\nDonald Trump, Donald Trump could learn something from them.\nThat brings me to the final point I want to make today \u2013 the temperament it takesto be Commander-in-Chief.\nEvery President faces hard choices every day, with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives. That's the job.\nA revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region, an adversary reaches out for the first time in years \u2013 what do you do?\nMaking the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts. It takes a willingness to listen to other people's points of view with a truly open mind. It also takes humility \u2013 knowing you don't know everything \u2013 because if you're convinced you're always right, you'll never ask yourself the hard questions.\nI remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama, debating the potential Bin Laden operation. The President's advisors were divided. The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive. The risks of failure were daunting. The stakes were significant for our battle against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan. Most of all, the lives of those brave SEALs and helicopter pilots hung in the balance.\nIt was a decision only the President could make. And when he did, it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as I've ever seen.\nNow imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States. Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but America's entire arsenal.\nDo we want him making those calls \u2013 someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?\nI have a lot of faith that the American people will make the right decision. This is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride. We're all counting on that.\nBecause making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. It would undo so much of the work that Republicans and Democrats alike have done over many decades to make America stronger and more secure. It would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory. And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are \u2013 that we're fearful, not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us, instead of shaping our own destiny.\nThat's not the America I know and love.\nSo yes, we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure. And we need to do better by American families and American workers \u2013 and we will. But don't let anyone tell you that America isn't great. Donald Trump's got America all wrong. We are a big-hearted, fair-minded country.\nThere is no challenge we can't meet, no goal we can't achieve when we each do our part and come together as one nation.\nEvery lesson from our history teaches us that we are stronger together. We remember that every Memorial Day.\nThis election is a choice between two very different visions of America.\nOne that's angry, afraid, and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline.\nThe other is hopeful, generous, and confident in the knowledge that America is great \u2013 just like we always have been.\nLet's resolve that we can be greater still. That is what I believe in my heart.\nI went to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. And I never lost my sense of pride at seeing our blue-and-white plane lit up on some far-off runway, with? ?'The United States of America'\u00a0emblazoned on the side. That plane \u2013 those words \u2013 our country represents something special, not just to us, to the world. It represents freedom and hope and opportunity.\nI love this country and I know you do too. It's been an honor and a privilege toserve America and I'm going to do everything I can to protect our nation, and make sure we don't lose sight of how strong we really are.\nThank you all very much.\n","139":"\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I\u2019d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.\nIt\u2019s time to shake the rust off America\u2019s foreign policy. It\u2019s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. Has to be first, has to be.\nThat will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America \u2013 thank you. [Applause]\nAmerica first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of.\nIn the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War, it lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, \u201cTear down this wall.\u201d [Applause]\nHistory will not forget what he did. Very special, special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.\nThey just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama\u2019s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy.\nWe tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.\nThey have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.\nFirst, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He\u2019s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.\nWe\u2019re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.\nI\u2019m the only one \u2014 believe me, I know them all, I\u2019m the only one that knows how to fix it. [Applause]\nSecondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I\u2019ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so.\nThey look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.\nThe countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice. [Applause]\nThe whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.\nThirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can\u2019t depend on us. We\u2019ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we\u2019ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. [Applause]\nAnd under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon. [Applause]\nAll of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran\u2019s treatment of our ten captured sailors \u2014 so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.\nWhen the other side knows you\u2019re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win \u2014 you just can\u2019t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You\u2019ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program, then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.\nIsrael, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.\nPresident Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we\u2019ve done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself. [Applause]\nWe\u2019ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they\u2019re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good.\nFourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they\u2019re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don\u2019t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don\u2019t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.\nPerhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s called no respect. Absolutely no respect.\nDo you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth \u2014 fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip \u2014 unprecedented \u2014 comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.\nThe list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don\u2019t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.\nHe has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We\u2019ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama\u2019s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.\nFinally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we\u2019ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we\u2019re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we\u2019re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place.\nWe\u2019re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We\u2019ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide. [Applause]\nWe have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we\u2019re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won\u2019t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never, ever solve the problem. [Applause]\nHillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton\u2019s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.\nClinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don\u2019t blockade, we don\u2019t bomb, we don\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s almost as if our country doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening, which could be a fact and could be true.\nThis will all change when I become president.\nTo our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It\u2019s going to be a great and reliable ally again. It\u2019s going to be a friend again. We\u2019re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies. [Applause]\nWe\u2019re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water\u2019s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.\nThis is how we won the Cold War and it\u2019s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president. [Applause]\nFirst, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it\u2019s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.\nIn this, we\u2019re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.\nWe should work \u2014 thank you. [Applause]\nWe should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It\u2019s now two-way. And remember, us and all we\u2019re doing, they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done to them. We\u2019re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There\u2019s no documentation. There\u2019s no paperwork. There\u2019s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.\nA pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what\u2019s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked \u2014 one of the true great catastrophes.\nAnd then there\u2019s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won\u2019t tell them where and I won\u2019t tell them how. We must \u2026 [Applause]\n\u2026 we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We\u2019re sending troops. We tell them. We\u2019re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.\nBut they\u2019re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I\u2019m elected president. And they\u2019ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly. [Applause]\nSecondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what\u2019s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.\nAnd what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that, in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted, and we\u2019re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.\nWe will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.\nBut we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We\u2019re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.\nThis will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge. This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. \nA great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans \u2026 [Applause]\n\u2026 our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration. [Applause]\nFinally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania \u2014 and this was a horrible period of time for us \u2014 were attacked, and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole.\nAnd what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade Organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn\u2019t do it.\nAnd then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America\u2019s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.\nIn the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.\nWe have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends. [Applause]\nWe desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.\nRussia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, an improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.\nSome say the Russians won\u2019t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can\u2019t make a deal under my administration, a deal that\u2019s great \u2014 not good, great \u2014 for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It\u2019s as simple as that. We\u2019re going to find out.\nFixing our relations with China is another important step \u2014 and really toward creating a even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.\nWe have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing it.\nNo respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to have to happen.\nAfter I\u2019m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO\u2019s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism. [Applause]\nI will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win. [Applause]\nI will never send our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V. [Applause]\nOur goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we\u2019ve had the exact opposite \u2014 a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wake.\nAfter losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama-Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.\nI will also be prepared to deploy America\u2019s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination.\nOur power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me. [Applause]\nHowever, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really, truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very, very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.\nAnd now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That\u2019s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people. [Applause]\nWe have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television.\nFinally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions. [Applause]\nThese are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that\u2019s what we want. We want them to be our allies.\nWe want the world to be our \u2014 we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.\nTo achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans \u2026 [Applause]\n\u2026 Americans must know that we\u2019re putting the American people first again on trade. [Applause]\nSo true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority. [Applause]\nNo country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter\u2026 [Applause]\nAnd under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs. [Applause]\nNAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states \u2014 literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I\u2019ve just gotten to see it. I\u2019ve toured Pennsylvania. I\u2019ve toured New York. I\u2019ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.\nNever again, only the reverse \u2014 and I have to say this strongly \u2014 never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.\nUnder a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country. [Applause]\nI will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America\u2019s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.\nThe world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play that role, we must make America strong again. [Applause]\nAnd always \u2014 always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must \u2014 we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that \u2014 and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you. [Applause]\nThank you very much. [Applause]\nThank you.\n","140":"\nGood evening. Thank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I'm a newcomer to politics, but not to backing the Jewish state.\nIn 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly, the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane, because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.\nIn spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel, and frankly, for anyone supporting Israel. Many people turned down this honor; I did not. I took the risk and I'm glad I did.\nBut I didn't come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That's what politicians do, all talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother, the only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.\nThank you. My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. Thank you. I have been in business a long time, I know deal making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East.\nThe problem here is fundamental. We've rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return. I've studied this issue in great detail. I would say, actually, greater by far than anybody else, believe me, oh, believe me.\nAnd it's a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.\nThe deal doesn't even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years, but when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel.\nWhen I'm president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region.\nIran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I'm not elected president, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that's why I'm going to be elected president, folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that, please.\nIran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally, every day Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states, Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I'll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have.\nNow they're in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank, they're openly offering Palestinians 7,000 dollars per terror attack and 30,000 dollars for every Palestinian terrorist home that's been destroyed, a deplorable, deplorable situation.\nIran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.\nSecondly, we will totally dismantle Iran's global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us.\nIran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They've got terror cells everywhere, including in the Western Hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.\nThird, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract enforced before, folks, believe me.\nIran has already, since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. Those ballistic missiles, with a range of 1,250 miles, were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe and someday maybe hit even the United States and we're not going to let that happen, we're not letting it happen and we're not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.\nThank you. Do you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi were the words \"Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth.\" You can forget that.\nWhat kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And here's another. You talk about twisted, here's another twisted part. Testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we've made. The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, I promise, we will.\nThank you. Which brings me to my next point, the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it's not a friend to freedom, it's not a friend even to the United States of America; whereas you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to Israel.\nWith President Obama, in his final year, yay, he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me, believe me, and you know it better than anybody. So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear, an agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster.\nThe United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president 100 percent.\nWhen people ask why, it's because that's not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together, they come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something, its values. I mean, we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires. That's what a deal is.\nA deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That's not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It's not going to happen, folks.\nAnd further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they're stabbing Israelis and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenal young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don't reward behavior like that. You cannot do it. There's only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it.\nSo it's not up to the United Nations to really go with a solution. It's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. They have no choice, they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It's so preposterous. We're not going to let that happen.\nWhen I'm president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent.\nYou see, I know about deal making, that's what I do. I wrote the Art of the Deal. One of the bestselling all-time, and I mean, seriously, I'm saying \"one of,\" because I'll be criticized if I say \"the,\" so I'm going to be very diplomatic, \"one of,\" I'll be criticized, I think it is\nnumber one, but why take a chance. One of the all-time bestselling books about deals and deal making.\nTo make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying.\nThat's right. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous; Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer; the Palestinian Authority rejected it also.\nThen John Kerry tried to come up with the framework and Abbas didn't even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn't even respond. When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one.\nThank you. And when I say something, I mean it.\nI will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we'll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. Meanwhile, every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and to hate the Jews. It has to stop.\nWhen you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can't let this continue. We can't let this happen any longer.\nYou cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible way to think. It's a barrier that can't be broken. That will end and it'll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you've got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace, they've got to go out and they've got to start [sic] this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it and now.\nThere is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies.\nAnd you see that happening all the time, that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is a total disaster, by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.\nBut it's repeated itself over and over again and it's done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn't happen.\nPresident Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it's precisely the opposite that happens. Already half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half. So it's a very difficult situation that's never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We'll get it solved one way or the other. We will get it solved.\nBut when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That's what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States.\nWe will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel.\nThe Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that.\nAnd they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state.\nI love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I've been with Israel so long in terms of I've received some of my greatest honors from Israel; my father before me, incredible. My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact, it could be happening right now, which would be very nice as far as I'm concerned.\nSo I want to thank you very much, this has been a truly great honor. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n","141":"\nThank you so much. It is wonderful to be here and see so many friends. I've spoken at a lot of AIPAC conferences in the past, but this has to be one of the biggest yet and there are so many young people here, thousands of college students from hundreds of campuses around the country. I think we should all give them a hand for being here and beginning their commitment to this important cause.\nYou will keep the U.S.-Israel relationship going strong. You know, as a senator from New York and secretary of state I've had the privilege of working closely with AIPAC members to strengthen and deepen America's ties with Israel. Now, we may not have always agreed on every detail, but we've always shared an unwavering, unshakable commitment to our alliance and to Israel's future as a secure and democratic homeland for the Jewish people.\nAnd your support helped us expand security and intelligence, cooperation, develop the Iron Dome missile defense system, build a global coalition to impose the toughest sanctions in the history on Iran and so much more. Since my first visit to Israel 35 years ago, I've returned many times and made many friends. I've worked with and learned from some of Israel's great leaders, although, I don't think Yitzhak Rabin ever forgave me for banishing him to the White House balcony when he wanted to smoke.\nNow I'm here as a candidate for president and I know that all of you understand what's at stake in this election. Our next president will walk into the Oval Office next January and immediately face a world of both perils we must meet with strength and skill and opportunities we must seize and build on. The next president will sit down at that desk and start making decisions that will affect both the lives and livelihoods of every American and the security of our friends around the world.\nSo we have to get this right. As AIPAC members, you understand that while the turmoil of the Middle East presents enormous challenge and complexity, walking away is not an option.\nCandidates for president who think the United States can outsource Middle East security to dictators or that America no longer has vital national interests at stake in this region are dangerously wrong. It would be a serious mistake for the United States to abandon our responsibilities or cede the mantle of leadership for global peace and security to anyone else.\nAs we gather here, three evolving threats, Iran's continued aggression, a rising tide of extremism across a wide ark of instability and the growing effort to delegitimize Israel on the world stage are converging to make the U.S.-Israel alliance more indispensable than ever.\nWe have to combat all these trends with even more intense security and diplomatic cooperation. United States and Israel must be closer than ever, stronger than ever and more determined than ever to prevail against our common adversaries and to advance our shared values.\nThis is especially true at a time when Israel faces brutal terrorist stabbings, shootings and vehicle attacks at home. Parents worry about letting their children walk down the street, families live in fear. Just a few weeks ago, a young American veteran and West Point graduate named Taylor Force was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist near the Jaffa Port. These attacks must end immediately and Palestinian leaders need to stop inciting violence, stop celebrating terrorists as martyrs and stop paying rewards to their families.\nBecause we understand the threats Israel faces, we know we can never take for granted the strength of our alliance or the success of our efforts. Today, Americans and Israelis face momentous choices that will shape the future of our relationship and of both our nations. The first choice is this, are we prepared to take the U.S.-Israel alliance to the next level? This relationship has always been stronger and deeper than the headlines might lead you to believe. Our work together to develop the Iron Dome saved many Israeli lives when Hamas rockets began to fly.\nI saw its effectiveness firsthand in 2012, when I worked with Prime Minister Netanyahu to negotiate a seize fire in Gaza and if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president, the United States will reaffirm we have a strong and enduring national interest in Israel's security. And we will never allow Israel's adversaries to think a wedge can be driven between us.\nWhen we have differences, as any friends do, we will work to resolve them quickly and respectfully. We will also be clear that the United States has an enduring interest in and commitment to a more peaceful, more stable, more secure Middle East and we will step up our efforts to achieve that outcome. Indeed, at a time of unprecedented chaos and conflict in the region, America needs an Israel strong enough to deter and defend against its enemies, strong enough to work with us to tackle shared challenges and strong enough to take bold steps in the pursuit of peace.\nThat's why I believe we must take our alliance to the next level. I hope a new 10-year defense memorandum of understanding is concluded as soon as possible to meet Israel's security needs far into the future. That will also send a clear message to Israel's enemies that the United States and Israel stand together united. It's also why, as president, I will make a firm commitment to ensure Israel maintains its qualitative military edge.\nThe United States should provide Israel with the most sophisticated defense technology so it can deter and stop any threat. That includes bolstering Israeli missile defenses with new systems, like the Arrow 3 and David's Sling, and we should work together to develop better tunnel detection technology to prevent arms smuggling, kidnapping and terrorist attacks.\nOne of the first things I'll do in office is invite the Israeli prime minister to visit the White House and I will send a delegation from the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs to Israel forearly consultations. Let's also expand our collaboration beyond security. Together we can build an even more vibrant culture of innovation that tightens the links between Silicon Valley and Israeli tech companies and entrepreneurs.\nThere is much Americans can learn from Israel from cybersecurity to energy security to water security and just on an everyday people to people level. And it's especially important to continue fostering relationships between American and Israeli young people who may not always remember our shared past. They are the future of our relationship and we have to do more to promote that. Many of the young people here today are on the front lines of the battle to oppose the alarming boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement known as BDS.\nParticularly at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise across the world, especially in Europe, we must repudiate all efforts to malign, isolate and undermine Israel and the Jewish people.\nI've been sounding the alarm for a while now. As I wrote last year to the heads of major American-Jewish organizations, we have to be united in fighting back against BDS. Many of its proponents have demonized Israeli scientists and intellectuals, even students. To all the college students who may have encountered this on campus, I hope you stay strong, keep speaking out, don't let anyone silence you, bully you or try to shut down debate, especially in places of learning like colleges and universities.\nAnti-Semitism has no place in any civilized society. Not in America, not in Europe, not anywhere.\nNow, all of this work defending Israel's legitimacy, expanding security and economic ties, taking our alliance to the next level depends on electing a president with a deep, personal commitment to Israel's future as a secure, democratic Jewish state and to America's responsibilities as a global leader. Tonight, you'll hear from candidates with very different visions of American leadership in the region and around the world. You'll get a glimpse of a potential U.S. foreign policy that would insult our allies, not engage them and embolden our adversaries, not defeat them.\nFor the security of Israel and the world, we need America to remain a respected global leader committed to defending and advancing the international order, an America able to block efforts to isolate or attack Israel. The alternative is unthinkable.\nYes, we need steady hands, not a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who knows what on Wednesday, because everything's negotiable. Well, my friends, Israel's security is non-negotiable.\nI have sat in Israeli hospital rooms holding the hands of men and women whose bodies and lives were torn apart by terrorist bombs. I've listened to doctors describe the shrapnel left in a leg, an arm or even a head. That's why I feel so strongly that America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security or survival. We can't be neutral when rockets rain down on residential neighborhoods, when civilians are stabbed in the street, when suicide bombers target theinnocent. Some things aren't negotiable and anyone who doesn't understand that has no business being our president.\nThe second choice we face is whether we will have the strength and commitment to confront the adversaries that threaten us, especially Iran. For many years, we've all been rightly focused on the existential danger of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. After all, this remains an extremist regime that threatens to annihilate Israel.\nThat's why I led the diplomacy to impose crippling sanctions and force Iran to the negotiating table and why I ultimately supported the agreement that has put a lid on its nuclear program. Today, Iran's enriched uranium is all but gone, thousands of centrifuges have stopped spinning, Iran's potential breakout time has increased and new verification measures are in place to help us deter and detect any cheating.\nI really believe the United States, Israel and the world are safer as a result, but still, as I laid out in a speech at the Brookings Institution last year, it's not good enough to trust and verify. Our approach must be distrust and verify.\nThis deal must come with vigorous enforcement, strong monitoring, clear consequences for any violations and a broader strategy to confront Iran's aggression across the region. We cannot forget that Tehran's fingerprints are on every conflict across the Middle East from Syria to Lebanon to Yemen. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its proxies are attempting to establish a position on the Golan from which to threaten Israel and they continue to fund Palestinian terrorists.\nIn Lebanon, Hezbollah is amassing an arsenal of increasingly sophisticated rockets and artillery that well may be able to hit every city in Israel. Tonight, you will hear a lot of rhetoric from the other candidates about Iran, but there's a big difference between talking about holding Tehran accountable and actually doing it. Our next president has to be able to hold together our global coalition and impose real consequences for even the smallest violations of this agreement.\nWe must maintain the legal and diplomatic architecture to turn all the sanctions back on if needed. If I'm elected, the leaders of Iran will have no doubt that if we see any indication that they are violating their commitments not to seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons, the United States will act to stop it and that we will do so with force if necessary.\nIranian provocations, like the recent ballistic missile tests also are unacceptable and should be answered firmly and quickly, including with more sanctions.\nThose missiles were stamped with words declaring, and I quote, \"Israel should be wiped from the pages of history.\" We know they could reach Israel or hit the tens of thousands of American troops stationed in the Middle East. This is a serious danger and it demands a serious response.\nThe United States must also continue to enforce existing sanctions and impose additional sanctions as needed on Iran and the Revolutionary Guard for their sponsorship of terrorism, illegal arms transfers, human rights violations and other illicit behaviors, like cyber-attacks. We should continue to demand the safe return of Robert Levinson and all American citizens unjustly held in Iranian prisons.\nAnd we must work closely with Israel and other partners to cut off the flow of money and arms from Iran to Hezbollah. If the Arab League can designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, surely it is time for our friends in Europe and the rest of the international community to do so as well and to do that now.\nAt the same time, America should always stand with those voices inside Iran calling for more openness. Now look, we know the supreme leader still calls the shots and that the hardliners are intent on keeping their grip on power, but the Iranian people themselves deserve a better future and they are trying to make their voices heard. They should know that America is not their\nenemy, they should know we will support their efforts to bring positive change to Iran.\nNow, of course, Iran is not the only threat we and Israel face. The United States and Israel also have to stand together against the threat from ISIS and other radical jihadists. An ISIS affiliate in the Sinai is reportedly stepping up attempts to make inroads in Gaza and partners with Hamas.\nOn Saturday, a number of Israelis and other foreigners were injured or killed in a bombing in Istanbul that may well be linked to ISIS. Two of the dead are U.S.-Israeli dual nationals. This is a threat that knows no borders. That's why I've laid out a plan to take the fight to ISIS from the air, on the ground with local forces and online where they recruit and inspire. Our goal cannot be to contain ISIS; we must defeat ISIS.\nAnd here is a third choice, will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? Despite many setbacks, I remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee Israel's long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state.\nIt may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists, but inaction cannot be an option. Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state in peace and dignity and only a negotiated two-state agreement can provide those outcomes.\nIf we look at the broader, regional context, converging interests between Israel and key Arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Israelis and Palestinians could contribute to our greater cooperation between Israel and Arabs. I know how hard all of this is. I remember what it took just to convene Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face peace talks in 2010 that I presided over, but Israelis and Palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace.\nThat will only make it harder later. All of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress, including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust. Like the recent constructive meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the Palestinian economy or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\nBut at the same time, all of us must condemn actions that setback the cause of peace. Terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated and children should not be taught to hate in schools.\nThat poisons the future. Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts and as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear, I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.\nThere is one more choice that we face together and in some ways, it may be the most important of all, will we as Americans and as Israelis stay true to the shared democratic values that have always been at the heart of our relationship? We are both nations built by immigrants and exiles seeking to live and worship in freedom, nations built on principles of equality, tolerance and pluralism.\nAt our best, both Israel and America are seen as a light unto the nations because of those values. This is the real foundation of our alliance and I think it's why so many Americans feel such a deep emotional connection with Israel. I know that I do and it's why we cannot be neutral about Israel and Israel's future, because in Israel's story, we see our own and the story of all people who struggle for freedom and self-determination.\nThere's so many examples. You know, we look at the pride parade in Tel Aviv, one of the biggest and most prominent in the world and we marvel that such a bastion of liberty exists in a region so plagued by intolerance. We see the vigorous, even raucous debate in Israeli politics and feel right at home.\nAnd of course, some of us remember a woman, Golda Meir, leading Israel's government decades ago and wonder what's taking us so long here in America.\nBut we cannot rest on what previous generations have accomplished. Every generation has to renew our values and yes, even fight for them. Today, Americans and Israelis face currents of intolerance and extremism that threaten the moral foundations of our societies. Now, in a democracy, we're going to have differences, but what Americans are hearing on the campaign trail this year is something else entirely, encouraging violence, playing coy with white supremacists, calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported, demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion and proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.\nNow, we've had dark chapters in our history before, we remember the nearly 1,000 Jews aboard the St. Louis who were refused entry in 1939 and sent back to Europe, but America should be better than this and I believe it's our responsibility as citizens to say so. If you see bigotry, oppose it. If you see violence, condemn it. If you see a bully, stand up to him.\nOn Wednesday evening, Jews around the world will celebrate the Festival of Purim and children will learn the story of Esther who refused to stay silent in the face of evil. It wasn't easy, she had a good life and by speaking out, she risked everything, but as Mordecai reminded her, we all have an obligation to do our part when danger gathers and those of us with power or influence have a special responsibility to do what's right.\nAs Elie Wiesel said when accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, \"Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.\" So my friends, let us never be neutral or silent in the face of bigotry. Together, let's defend the shared values that already make America and Israel great.\nLet us do the hard work necessary to keep building our friendship and reach out to the next generation of Americans and Israelis so the bonds between our nations grow even deeper and stronger. We are stronger together and if we face the future side by side, I know for both Israel and America our best days are still ahead.\nThank you so much.\n","142":"\nMADDOW: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for this time.\nCLINTON: My pleasure to see you again.\nMADDOW: So, we're very close to voting in New Hampshire.\nCLINTON: We are.\nMADDOW: The polls show Senator Sanders still significantly ahead. If you do not win in New Hampshire, does that imply that there's going to be \u2014 or in your mind, does that mean you need to change course at all? Will that mean your campaign going ahead will be different than leading into this?\nCLINTON: You know, Rachel, I've always had a different view on this than I think maybe some others have. I always knew Iowa was going to be really, really hard. And we won, narrow, but a win is a win.\nMADDOW: One quarter of one percent.\nCLINTON: Yes, I'm always happy about that. I always knew that Senator Sanders been in public life next door for 25 years, he's on the Congress for that long, he had a tremendous amount of familiarity and a sense of really belonging in the area. So, I always knew this was going to be hard. I feel good about the campaign we waged here. I think we have an uphill battle. We're going to battle it until the last votes are counted and we're going to turn around and head off for the next contest.\nMADDOW: Politico.com just this afternoon just published something that says that there's changes in the works. There's always these sort of campaign gossip stories. But they are say \u2014 they say they're citing a half dozen people with direct knowledge of the situation. Their lead is, \"Hillary and Bill Clinton are so dissatisfied with their campaign's messaging and digital operations, they're considering staffing and strategy changes after what's expected to be a loss in Tuesday's primary.\" Are you planning some sort of shake up like that?\nCLINTON: Yes, somebody showed that to me. I have no idea what they are talking about or who they are talking to. We're going to take stock. But it's going to be the campaign I've got. I'm confident in the people I have. I'm very committed to them. They're committed to doing the best we can. We're going to take stock. What works, what doesn't work? We're moving into a different phase of the campaign. We're moving into different geographic areas. So, of course, it would be malpractice not to say, OK, what worked? What can we do better? What can we do new and different that we have to pull out?\nMADDOW: President Clinton was here with you today as was your daughter. President Clinton did his own event yesterday which made some headlines, when he had some very harsh criticism for Senator Sanders campaign, essentially calling Senator Sanders and his campaign hypocritical, dishonest, calling out sexism from Senator Sanders supporters. Although Senator Sanders have called out his on supporters for sexism and said he will not tolerate it. Is President Clinton going further than you would in those criticisms for the Sanders campaign or do you also share the view that he's been dishonest and hypocritical?\nCLINTON: Well, here's my view, and I think Bill was really defending my supporters because we know a lot of them are being harassed online, they're being harassed at our events. They are being really treated badly. Look, I'm all for people who are for my opponent. I think it's great to bring in as many new, young people as possible. I want people treated respectfully. I think that's part of what he was talking about. I have been concerned about tone of his campaign over the last weeks. We were running I thought a good campaign on issues. We're getting to the point we have to draw contrasts. That's natural. You know, I have a health care approach. He has a health care approach. We may have the same goal, but we have a different view about how we get there. That is fair game, as it should be. But there has been a constant undercurrent that I said in the debate last week, was a kind of attack by innuendo, insinuation, kind of artful smears. And I just said enough is enough. You know, if you have something to say to my face, say it. If you can point to any event, any vote, any view that you think has been influenced by any donation I've ever made, call it out, you know? Then, they put up the bankruptcy bill. I answered that yesterday on the morning shows. And so, I want this innuendo to stop. You know, let's just be honest with each other. Look, Senator Sanders has taken money from Wall Street. He took it through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. That's what we do. That doesn't mean his views are compromised. It doesn't mean my views and it doesn't mean that President Obama's views when he was running for the presidency \u2014 he took a lot of money from Wall Street \u2014 in any way stopped him from pushing through and signing Dodd Frank and imposing tough rules. So, it's a \u2014 you know, he gets his supporters \u2014 he sends some messages and his campaign then amplifies those messages. And then a lot of his young people get really worked up and they're going off on tangents. They can attack me, that's fine. I'm in the arena. But to go after journalists who say something nice about me, to go after supporters who post things, to go after elected officials who are for me, because, you know, I have the vast majority of elected officials on the Democratic side because they know us both. And they know I would be the president who can actually get done what I'm saying.\nMADDOW: As a journalist, and who is an out and proud liberal, I get attacked 50\/50 by people who say I'm a dyed in the wool partisan for Bernie and then the other 50 said, it said I'm dyed in the wool partisan for you. And people really have decided one way or the other, about 50\/50, that I'm completely in the tank. I do not notice a difference in the tone or the nastiness or the snark or the inappropriateness of those attacks that I get from the people who support you or Senator Sanders. If you did want to change the tone of things from your supporters, could you? I mean, he said he doesn't want sexism and other forms of offensive comments from his supporters, can he do more than he is? Could you do more than you do?\nCLINTON: I think we should do what we can. But I'm also focused on what he says. You know, his argument basically is this. Anyone who has taken a donation from anyone connected with Wall Street is compromised. They're vote has been bought. They can't be trusted. That is just not true. If it is true, now it includes him we know because he's taken contributions from Wall Street.\nMADDOW: He said yesterday that no politician, there's never been a politician in history who says, yes, the money that I took influences me. So, therefore, essentially implying like the defense that there isn't, that you don't claim to be been influenced is by the donations is no defense.\nCLINTON: But let's put out the proof, Rachel. Don't listen to what people say. I find it deeply offensive. You know, I have worked really hard. I've taken on many more powerful groups than he has. I've taken on the drug companies, the insurance companies. I've got big oil going after me. I've got hedge fund guys spending $6 millions of dollars in ads against me, which I would think would raise an interesting question if they are so worried about Bernie, why are they trying to defeat me? I've taken onto gun lobby, something that, you know, he never has done. So, I've got the scars to prove my bona fides and what I'm willing to take on and how I've stood firm against an onslaught of attacks, you know, turning me into the political pinata sometimes. So, point to the evidence. Otherwise, stop it. Let's talk about I want to get to universal coverage building on the Affordable Care Act. You want to start over with single payer. Let the people decide what's the best way to do this. So, that's what this should be about.\nMADDOW: On the \u2014 staying for a moment on that, that line of attack. You had mentioned in the debate when Chuck asked you about transcripts of speeches that you gave paid speeches, that you would look into it. We've had some further word from your campaign that there may be a release of those transcripts. What's the status of that? Do you expect to release those speeches?\nCLINTON: Well, you know what I said the other day \u2014 you know, look, I'm getting a little bit weary of the double standard. There's a lot of people on both sides. If we're going to start saying what you did when you're out of public office, when you're in the private sector, what you did, fair game. Release it all. I'm all for that.\nMADDOW: You mean all presidential candidates?\nCLINTON: Yes, everybody, release everything. But again, I've been asking to do something for which there's no basis, just the attempt to cast suspicion. So, I said I will look into it. We will look into it. But, you know, what's good for the gander should be good for the goose. [laughter]\nMADDOW: So, you wouldn't do it unilaterally, but if everybody's going to do it, you would do it?\nCLINTON: Well, this is \u2014 I'm really not thinking about it until I get through New Hampshire, to be honest. I want to get through tomorrow, and then, you know, it's going to be very boring for people once it is done under whatever circumstances.\nMADDOW: Did you see the Republican debate on Saturday night?\nCLINTON: I was at my own event in Portsmouth. So, I \u2014 I did not see.\nMADDOW: Have you been able to resist the temptation to watch the clips of Marco Rubio saying the same thing over and over and over again?\nCLINTON: I did get to see that because I was on every news channel that I was flipping around.\nMADDOW: Do you have \u2014 I mean, he's seen as at least coming out of Iowa as having a lot of momentum as a potential nominee for the Republican Party. Do you have any reaction or opinion about that performance from him?\nCLINTON: I'm going to leave my opinions to myself because I don't want to in any way influence their process, because they have to make their decision and clearly, the longer it lasts and the more difficult it is, the better it will be for us.\nMADDOW: I went to some Republican candidate events since I've been up here and \u2014\nCLINTON: They let you in?\nMADDOW: They let me in. I wear a baseball hat. Incognito situation. But I specifically wanted to talk to women voters who were there at Republican candidate events. And I found a number of different women to talk to. Some are dyed this wool Republicans, but more often I found are women open to the idea of voting for a Democrat. I talked to a few women who voted for Barack Obama either last time or in 2008. But they are shopping for a Republican candidate this year. And 2-1, the reason they said they are shopping for a Republican candidate and not thinking about voting here in the Democratic side is because they do not believe that you are honest. They have issue with your trustworthiness. I know you see this come up in the polls and people talk about their feelings about the various candidates. I'm sure you disagree with that assessment from them. I understand that. But how do you make the case to people, to women in particular for whom that's the objection. That's why they can't pull the lever for you.\nCLINTON: You know, obviously, this is not anything I want to hear because I find it so absolutely contrary to who I am and who all these people who support me, who know me, work with me and count on me know who I am. But I thought a lot about it, Rachel, because when you think back, I emerged on the national scene in 1992. I have been under relentless attack ever since. Now, just read behavioral science, read psychology, even when the attacks proved to be unfounded, untrue, it leaves a residue, right? People say, well, why is she being attacked so much? It must be something there. So, I get through the '90s. I run for the Senate. Same thing happen. I worked, I gained the trust of the people of New York. When I run again, I get a larger percentage of the vote. So, people who see me in action, people who count on me, people who know that if I tell you something intend to do, I will do everything in my power to make that happen. Then President-elect Obama turns around after that hard fought campaign with all sorts of accusations flying around, say I trust you, I want you to be my secretary of state. When I'm holding office, I get along well with Republicans. I will always have the, you know, right wingers who are never going to give up on trying to push me down and push me out. They view me as a threat. And I accept that. But when I get to work with people, we get things done. And that's been my pattern. So, when I get that question and I ask people, I say what is it you are really reacting to? Very often they don't know. Then a lot of them will say, well, Benghazi. I said, OK, Benghazi. You know, did you know there were nine separate investigations, eight of them independent, one of them clearly partisan admittedly to try to bring me down politically. And they all reach the same conclusions. There were things we could have and should have done better. I immediately said we would. I testified for 11 hours. I answered every question, but it's still on the TV. I hear people talking about it. I can't stop them from talking about it. I can only tell you what the facts are. I can tell you that in the last, what, 36, 37 years, we've had terrorist problems in Iran, in Lebanon, in Kenya, in Tanzania, in New York and, yes, in Benghazi \u2014 none of them were every politicized. We lost 258 marines and embassy personnel in Beirut. The Democrats didn't stand up and go after the secretary of state. We lost people in Kenya and Tanzania, 12 Americans, hundreds of Africans. Madeleine Albright was secretary of state, she forthrightly asked for a report. She made it public. People didn't turn it into a partisan attack. So, I have to only conclude that there is a concerted effort to try to make partisan advantage by really throwing some much at me that even if little splotches of it stick, it will cloud people's judgment of me. So, that's a burden I carry. But when you stop and think, you know, the people who have supported me are not doing it because they just like me. I have the governor of Vermont supporting me. I have Pat Leahy, the senator from Vermont supporting me, the two former governors, Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean supporting me. They clearly know us both. They clearly prefer to support me. I have the senator here, the governor in New Hampshire. They know me. They trust me. They're not the kind of people who would just sign onto campaign for some frivolous reason. I have all my friends from the Senate, Cory Booker and Tim Kaine and Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Stabenow and Amy Klobuchar, they were all up here in the snow because they believe in me, and they trust me. So, I can't stop the barrage of attacks. I want your viewers and anyone else who would be interested in this to ask themselves, why does the right and particularly the Republicans, spend so much time, money and effort through the media, through their advertising because you look at the Republicans are running more ads against me than they run against each other, accusing me of being this and that, all kinds of accusations. Why? I'll tell you why, because they are afraid of me. They know that I will be a president who, yes, I will listen to people, I will seek common ground, but I will stand my ground and I know how to get things done. And that's the last thing these guys want to see again.\nMADDOW: What did you learn by going there that you didn't need before?\nCLINTON: Nothing substitutes for sitting like I did and you were there when you were there with mothers who told me about what had happened to their families. A mother who moved to Flint just serendipitously right up at the time the crisis was beginning, a year ago April, pregnant with twins, started seeing rashes, lost her twins. Just sitting there like I'm sitting with you just hearing that story, you know there is a depth of emotion and horror frankly associated with not being able to trust the water you drink and that you bathe your baby in. And listening to a lot of officials explained in detail how little control they had because their city was under emergency management under the governor, getting into the real detail about what they could and couldn't do and how they literally couldn't get phone calls returned, letters answered, talking to some of the water warriors who have been on this issue and doing everything they could to bring it to public attention, talking to the doctors who are leading up the efforts to test kid and what more they need. It really filled out in great excruciating detail how terribly damaged and abused this community has been and it reminded me that people have a right to be angry. I have no argument with the anger, the insecurity, the fear, the worry that people have when your government fails you, when the economy fails you, when politics fails you, anger is a natural and frankly expected result. But as we were talking yesterday and as this incredible mayor who has just taken this city on her back and is trying to lift it up said, OK, we are so distraught, our hearts are broken. Our stomachs are sick with worry about what happens next, but we need a plan. So I came to try to get them more support, working with all levels of government to try to make sure they had whatever they needed to do as much as possible to empower themselves, and I got a long list of, you know, follow up I will be doing over the next weeks.\nMADDOW: You said yesterday you were making a personal commitment you would see it through \u2014\nCLINTON: Yes.\nMADDOW: \u2014 to the end. I will say just my opinion being there, my felling when I was there was that I couldn't believe, the basic things that families needed to cope on a day-to-day basis were not attended to. What I aim at specifically there is no day-to-day delivery of clean water in Flint. So, there's a lot love people, average, poor American city, people don't have transportation or people could be house bound, elderly people, right now, still, to this day, today the day before the New Hampshire primary, the plan is for people to go out to the fire stations and collect their allotted one case of bottled water per day \u2014 is there a sense in which the emergency, not just fixing it for the long haul, but the emergency of what people need day-to-day still isn't being attended to and there ought to be some quicker response right now?\nCLINTON: Yes. Yes. Look, as I said yesterday, we've got a very big infrastructure problem that has to be fixed. Congress is working on that, my friend Debbie Stabenow is really leading the charge. We have a huge set of problems having to do with the needs that people have that are not being met. You mentioned one of them, clean water. We still don't have all the testing set up to be done.\nMADDOW: Right.\nCLINTON: We don't have the planning yet for what has to happen in the schools. We don't know whether we can get not just clean water, but the kind of nutrition that can maybe begin to mitigate to some extent the affects of blood before it gets from the bloodstream into tissues, muscles, et cetera. So, we have a long list and I brought some folks with me who are going to stay involved and help with that planning process and we have a big lack of trust, and one of the things that I have advocated is we need to find a way, not just to empower, but to hire people in the community, to be the outreach workers, to do the water delivery, to be on the front lines in their neighborhoods. So, we're putting together under the mayor's leadership a kind of matrix of tasks and who can do them, what they need to be able to do them. A lot of them don't need training. Some of them might. And so, how do we piece all this together and talking with the city council, county commissioners and others, there's roles for everybody to play, but somebody has to have the overall approach that is followed.\nMADDOW: And quick.\nCLINTON: Yes, and very quick.\n","143":"\nDICKERSON: We begin with campaign 2016 and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is fighting to close a double-digit gap in the polls behind Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. She joins us from Manchester. Secretary Clinton, your name came up, not surprisingly, in the Republican debate. [laughter]\nSenator Marco Rubio claimed that on the question of abortion that you support abortion on baby's due date. What do you say to that?\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's pretty pathetic, John. This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio has been just going as far as he can to try to, I guess, buttress his credentials with certain parts of the Republican constituency. I have been on record for years about where I stand on making abortion safe and legal, the exceptions that are appropriate, that should be looked into, and the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to excruciating kinds of decisions. And to begin to politicize this so early in the campaign season, to try to raise the false charges and look like he's going to try to make sure Roe v. Wade is overturned and Planned Parenthood is defunded is just a tried-and-true tactic by those on the right.\nDICKERSON: His charge here, though, is in terms of late-term abortions, that you talk about medical issues, but there are nonmedical abortions, he would say, and others who share his view would say, and that you're not having any restrictions on those who would choose to have an abortion for nonmedical reasons puts you on the extreme side of this.\nCLINTON: Well, it's just not true. People should go back read Roe v. Wade. Reasonable kinds of restrictions can be imposed as long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account, and that is what the law is today. And I remember very well having a lot of incredibly difficult conversations listening to women who were told something devastating toward the end of their pregnancy, who were facing horrible kinds of consequences to their health and even potentially to their life. That's why this has to be taken into account by each individual woman, by her physician and her family. But, of course, under Roe v. Wade, there are certain guidelines. And Senator Rubio should know that, or I hope he does now.\nDICKERSON: In the town hall the other night, you said that the financial interests \u2014 quote \u2014 \"are not giving me very much money now.\" But according to \"The Washington Post\" analysis, donors of hedge funds, banks, insurance companies and other financial service firms have given you at least $21.4 million. That's about 10 percent of what you have raised. That seems like a lot of money.\nCLINTON: Well, that's just not the calculation that we have done. But that's somebody's analysis. I'm not going to argue with it. What's really going on here, John, is disturbing to me. I will be really frank with you. What the Sanders campaign is trying to do is link donations to my political campaign or really donations to anyone's political campaign with undue influence, with changing people's views and votes. I have never, ever done that. And I really do resent the implication, or, as I said the other night, the insinuation. It would be like saying that President Obama, who took probably more money from Wall Street than any Democrat certainly had in 2008 with his successful campaign, was therefore automatically disqualified. Well, in fact, we know that was not true. He signed the toughest financial regulations since the 1930s with the Dodd-Frank bill. This is a very artful smear. And I'm just not going to sit and take it anymore.\nDICKERSON: Are you saying, though, on these questions that people from the financial services industry have no greater access to you than anybody else?\nCLINTON: I'm saying that I am available to and open to listening to people from all walks of life. I always have been. I always will be. But talk to the \u2014 if people want to donate to me from whatever industry, they know where I stand. They know that I called them out on the mortgage market mess back in \u2014 before the great crash happened. And I always like to remind people, it was not me, it was Senator Sanders who voted to deregulate slots and derivatives, which gave Lehman Brothers a lot of extra leverage, which was one of the contributing factors to their collapse, which obviously contributed to what happened in the great recession. So, we can take these step by step and try to unwind them, but it doesn't change the basic facts. People know where I stand. I rolled out the toughest, most effective effort to rein in financial abuse of anybody in this campaign. And it goes much further than Dodd-Frank. It goes much further than restoring Glass-Steagall, a 1930s efforts. It goes into shadow banking. It goes after hedge funds. It goes after carried interest loophole. Now, that is full disclosure. I am on the record. If somebody in one of these firms wants to give me money, I hope they know they're giving money to someone who is going to make sure they never wreck the economy again.\nDICKERSON: In the debate, you also said \u2014 quote \u2014 \"Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment.\"\nCLINTON: Right.\nDICKERSON: But isn't the experience you're \u2014 the experience you're running on gained through years of working in Democratic politics, doesn't that put you in the establishment, all that experience?\nCLINTON: Well, I don't know. Senator Sanders has lot more time in elective office than I do. And I find that sort of an amusing contrast. He's been elected official for 25 years, far longer than I was. I think I bring a great mix of experience. And I think being a woman is a big part of how I see problems, how I think about solving problems, what I believe is absolutely foundational, starting with children and their lives and their opportunities. On my way to Flint today to go and meet with the mayor, who asked me to come because she wants to keep the national spotlight on what happened to the children in her community. And I commend her for it. So, I think that the experiences I have had starting when I was in an advocate taking on the establishment, going on to be first lady, taking on the drug companies and the pharmacy companies, taking on the financial system, taking on a lot of big lobbies like the gun lobby, I think that I have shown that I have got a lot of experience taking on the establishment. And I'm proud of what I bring to the table to actually be able to solve problems and get results for people.\nDICKERSON: All right, Secretary Clinton, we will have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.\nCLINTON: Great to talk to you, John. Thanks.\n","144":"\nTODD: We'll have my interview this morning with Donald Trump in just a few minutes. But we're going to begin with the Democrats and former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. You liked that \"graveyard of pollsters\" line, didn't you?\nCLINTON: Well, I've lived through this twice \u2014\nTODD: You've lived through this.\nCLINTON: \u2014 in '92 and 2008. And look, I know I'm behind. And I'm going to keep fighting until the very last vote is counted because I care about this primary.\nTODD: Why do you think you started with such a big deficit this time, considering \u2014 look, this has been a big state to both your husband and yourself, very important.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nTODD: They've always helped you.\nCLINTON: Well, look, I can't sit here and analyze all the reasons. Obviously, one is that the senator has been in public life next door for 25 years. So there's a familiarity with him. I totally respect that. And I just think that what's great about this primary is New Hampshire voters take a first, second, third, fourth, fifth look. I mean, yesterday, as I was crisscrossing from one side of the state to the other, talking to voters, I literally had people come up, say you changed my mind, you know, who knows. I mean, this is what's so exciting about the primary, Chuck. I came in in 2008, as I recall, like 16 points behind. I remember the night before the primary in '92, Bill's pollster saying, you know, you're in single digits. It's over. Who knows. I love this excitement. And you know, I'm going to fight as hard as I can. But I'm having a great time whatever happens.\nTODD: All right. Let's \u2014 I want to go to the debate a little bit because I would say the foreign policy section is one that you guys wanted to highlight because you felt as if he didn't do so well. You brought up Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to talk about it. But some of the things that you said about Senator Obama's readiness on foreign policy, they are very similar to what you've said about Bernie Sanders. In '08, you said, \"I have a lifetime of experience that I will bring to the White House. I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House.\" Senator Obama has a speech he gave in 2002; it sounds very similar to what you said when you're like, OK, you had one vote on the Iraq war \u2014\nCLINTON: Well, you know what \u2014\nTODD: What's the difference between what you said about then- Senator Obama and what you're saying about Senator Sanders?\nCLINTON: There's a very big difference. In 2008, Senator Obama had really done his homework in the Senate. He'd been there by that time a few years. He had developed a network of advisors on national security and foreign policy issues. They were very diligent and focused on making sure he was ready, that he had as broad a set of views as possible. And they really went toe-to-toe with all the people supporting me. That's not happening in this campaign. There really isn't any kind of foreign policy network that is supporting and advising Senator Sanders. I'll let him speak for himself. I think that what's important is this job requires you to be ready on all aspects of it on the first day. And we know we got a particularly complex world right now. And the president's not going to have the time. Maybe previous presidents in past years could have a little more leeway because of, you know, the way the world functioned. But now it's North Korea with its missile tests, it's Russian aggression, it's enforcing the Iran agreement. You have to do it all at once.\nTODD: Do you think the Iraq vote should still matter to voters?\nCLINTON: Look, I think that voters are perfectly free to take into account anything they want to take. But I also hope they'll take the rest of the record. You know, I was involved in the biggest counterterrorism decision in the Obama administration to determine whether or not to go after bin Laden. I did put the sanctions on Iran to get them to the negotiating table. I think that this is a debate that the voters really have to pay attention to because it is choosing both a president and a commander in chief.\nTODD: I'm curious, do you believe if it wasn't for the Iraq War we wouldn't have ISIS today?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that's a hard conclusion to draw because, remember, we had Al Qaeda before we had ISIS. Al Qaeda attacked us in New York. Al Qaeda attacked our embassies in Africa \u2014\n[crosstalk]\nTODD: The argument is that the instability in Iraq is what has created this and that if we \u2014 that if Saddam Hussein were still there, we wouldn't have ISIS.\nCLINTON: Well, I think that's a lot of jumps in logic that to me doesn't really add up. The Iraq War, there's no doubt, contributed to instability. I'm not going to in any way deny that. But you cannot draw a direct line. What you can do is to say that jihadist terrorism starting with Al Qaeda \u2014\nTODD: Right.\nCLINTON: \u2014 and moving onto its latest incarnations, most particularly ISIS, is in response to a number of forces and factors that are roiling up the Middle East. And certainly fighting for what Islam means and how it's going to be presented and what people are going to mean when they talk about it \u2014 so, yes, we've got a much bigger set of problems.\nTODD: All right. Another thing I wanted to follow up on the debate. Senator Sanders called the entire business model of Wall Street a fraud. We didn't get a chance to ask you to respond directly to that critique. I'd like to ask you to respond to it now.\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's the kind of extreme statement that, once you really take a hard look at it, it's hard to understand. You know, when you talk about Wall Street, are we talking about every bank? Or are we talking about a particular part of New York? That's never really clarified. What I believe is that there are good actors and bad actors in every part of our economy. The job of the president is to weed out and prevent the bad actors from disrupting economic activity, from amassing too much power and influence. But we live in a complex global economy where we've got to have a good banking system that is able to service the American economy. And it needs to be more than just looking at the five banks that are the big banks. We have to have a much more robust community banking system, regional banking system, other forms of credit access. And that's what I am advocating for. And I still do not understand why I'm having this problem getting Senator Sanders to join me in going after what are the potential problems that are out there, the shadow banking sector and the investment and hedge fund sector.\nTODD: Do you \u2014 can you have a Treasury Secretary who isn't familiar with how Wall Street works? And I say this because I think there's so much distrust right now.\nCLINTON: Yes. There is. There is.\nTODD: On Wall Street. Six of the last Treasury Secretaries either came from Wall Street or went to Wall Street after. I think there certainly right now isn't an appetite for somebody from Wall Street to be the next Treasury Secretary. And yet can you have a Treasury Secretary if they don't understand Wall Street?\nCLINTON: Well, you have to have a Treasury Secretary who understands the economy, the American economy and the global economy. I think there are a lot more places where one can and should look for such a Treasury Secretary \u2014\n[crosstalk]\nTODD: Do you think you can pick one without having them have a Wall Street background?\nCLINTON: You know, I want somebody who can make a good commitment to work with me to get the economy moving, to get more good jobs created, to get incomes rising, to look out over the horizon at some of the economic problems that are out there. We've got to figure out what we're going to do with China. China is finally having to come to grips with the fact that a lot of its growth may not have been as on a firm foundation as we would hope. So we need people in government who have that kind of commitment and understanding. But we've got to put the needs of the American economy first. And that's going to be my commitment.\nTODD: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about a comment Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said \u2014 a comment that I've heard her say before. But it sort of rang differently to a lot of people. She said, there's a special place in hell for women who don't help women. But the implication is that somehow, if you're a Democratic woman and you're not supporting you, what's wrong with you? Do you want the vote to be decided on gender lines like that?\nCLINTON: Oh, look, you know, as you remember, Madeleine has been saying this for many, many years.\nTODD: Starbucks cups, I think, centers on that. I get that.\nCLINTON: She believes it firmly and., in part, because she knows what a struggle it has been. And she understands the struggle is not over. So I don't want people to be offended by what she is expressing as her very \u2014\nTODD: You can understand why some might have been offended by it?\nCLINTON: Well, good grief, we're getting offended about everything these days. Honest to goodness, I mean, people can't say anything without offending somebody. She has a life experience that I respect. I admire her greatly. And I think what she was trying to do, which she's done in every setting I've ever seen her, in going back 20-plus years, was to remind young women particularly that this struggle, which many of us have been part of is, not over. And don't be in any way lulled by the progress we've made. And I think it was a light-hearted but very pointed remark, which people can take however they choose.\nTODD: All right. What do you got in the Super Bowl?\nCLINTON: I don't have anybody right now.\nTODD: You don't have anybody?\nCLINTON: I'm going to Flint, Michigan, I'm worrying about the kids in Flint, Michigan, trying to figure out what we're going to do to make sure they're not damaged irreparably by this \u2014\nTODD: So you're going today, you could have gone Wednesday. That says something about how you feel about New Hampshire?\nCLINTON: I love New Hampshire. And you know, the mayor asked me to come. This was as early as we could get it done. I want to lend my support. I'm very hopeful the Congress, which is trying to work in a bipartisan way, will come up with some funding to deal with these problems that have afflicted the community. And I'm going to keep doing everything I can to help them.\nTODD: Secretary Clinton, I know you got a plane to catch.\nCLINTON: Thanks. Great to talk to you.\n","145":"\nTAPPER: Some breaking news now: CNN will host a Democratic debate in Flint, Michigan, on March 6, just two days before that state's primary. Hillary Clinton is actually going to leave the campaign trail here in New Hampshire to visit Flint, Michigan, today. But, first, she's right here... [laughter] ... right next to me, live. Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for being here.\nCLINTON: Well, Jake, congratulations on doing the debate in Flint. It's really important we keep the spotlight on this problem. And you're right. I'm leaving here. I'm going to Flint. The mayor asked me to come. They're trying to, you know, really have a lot of support, because we hope that there will be some good news coming out of Congress in the next few days. And it's just \u2014 it's an issue that I don't want people to forget about. Because it's not the only Flint in our country.\nTAPPER: Right.\nCLINTON: There are other places where these kinds of toxins, lead, other sorts of pollutants are really affecting people's lives. And I'm just not going to give up on this.\nTAPPER: Can I ask you a question? Just a clarification of what you think needs to be done in term of the people there...\nCLINTON: Yes.\nTAPPER: ... who need water and need infrastructure built.\nCLINTON: Right.\nTAPPER: You have called for the citizens of Michigan, the State of Michigan to be billed, but you're also supporting this bill from senators Stabenow and Peters from Michigan that would make it a federal payment.\nCLINTON: Right.\nTAPPER: Do you think that it should be a state issue in terms of the money paying for Flint, or should it be a federal issue?\nCLINTON: It should be both and partly because there's a broad set of needs that have to be addressed. Yes, the infrastructure must be repaired and modernized. Yes, we do have to get emergency means in to get water, get the kind of nutritional support. You know, I know something about lead poisoning because of work I've done in the past and \u2014\nTAPPER: With the Children's Defense Fund?\nCLINTON: Well, and as a senator from New York. We had a lot of, you know, old housing with lead paint in it. A lot of kids suffered from lead poisoning. And part of the challenge is you've got to intervene early. We need comprehensive health screenings. Then we need to figure out how do we get the right nutrition and vitamins. You've got to begin to work to counteract the lead. Then we've got to get the educational, additional help that kids need. This is a big deal, because it's not only about fixing the infrastructure, but it's also about the future. How we're going to take care of these kids going forward. So there's a lot of work to be done. And I think it has to be both the state and a federal responsibility.\nTAPPER: You know, what's really so upsetting is as you know, just a little bit of lead can cause permanent damage.\nCLINTON: There is no \u2014 there is no acceptable level of lead for kids.\nTAPPER: Yes. Exactly.\nCLINTON: None.\nTAPPER: So according to what we know now, the state knew, at least in February \u2014 and the federal EPA knew at least in April, and yet it wasn't until months, months later. So obviously, this is a failing on the local level. But do you also think it's a failing by the EPA?\nCLINTON: Well, I think it has to be absolutely investigated to figure out what happened. Why wasn't this sounding alarms everywhere? And I don't want to prejudge it. I don't know what the answer to that question is. I'm focused on OK, what do we do now? The damage has been done. How do we mitigate that damage? How do we help alleviate both intellectual and the physical, lasting consequences that children face when they've been poisoned by lead? So I'm trying to look at the future. I know there will be a lot of people focusing on what happened and that's really important, because we do have to, you know, open this inquiry more broadly. You know, I've said that we've got places in our country where we have asthma rates at 500 times higher, killing, you know, young children of color than anybody else because of where they live and what they're exposed to. You know, our children's health should be the highest priority for our country, and so anything I can do, and I'll keep doing it to really beat the drums on this but to ask people hey, let's look everywhere. You know, Flint \u2014 we've got to help flint. It's a terrible, horrible set of circumstances.\nTAPPER: Mm-hmm.\nCLINTON: But we also have to be looking at other places to try to make sure that this doesn't happen to other kids.\nTAPPER: So I can't help but notice it's also the New Hampshire primaries coming up in two day.\nCLINTON: Oh, it is? [laughter]\nTAPPER: So just to move to politics for one second. Your family has a long history here. You obviously won here in 2008. Your husband staged his comeback here in 1992. Can you win here? Is it possible that you can win here?\nCLINTON: I don't know. I don't know. I'm just going to work as hard as I can. I love the New Hampshire primary. I love it because the interactions you have with voters in every setting is so rewarding, and voters in this state take a first, second, third, fourth look at you. They're constantly evaluating. I have been telling voters across the state, this is the biggest job interview in the world. You've got to really think hard about what the job is, who can be president, who can be commander in chief, and then you have to really judge us. And I don't know what's going to happen. I know I'm behind. I am in very good spirits about that because I love the process.\nTAPPER: So you said the other night at the \u2014 I forget if it was the debate or the town hall, they all run together in my mind, but you said one of them that nobody can point to an example where you took money from a group...\nCLINTON: Right.\nTAPPER: ... and changed your vote. The Sanders campaign afterwards sent out an excerpt from a book from Elizabeth Warren in which she suggests that you took $140,000.00 from the banking interests, and as a result, according to Warren, not me, changed your vote on the bankruptcy bill.\nCLINTON: Right. Right.\nTAPPER: Now I want \u2014 I would love it if you would address the substance of the allegation. And also the fact that Sanders' campaign sent it out, but Sanders himself backed off from making the charge himself.\nCLINTON: Well. that's their \u2014 that's their typical, you know, artistic smear. You know, the campaign sends out something, gets people riled up, and then they say oh no, we're running a positive campaign. Enough. OK, I'm glad you raised this, because I really do want to get this record straight once and for all. I worked with Senator Warren with whom I have the highest regard, in 2000 to stop a very bad bankruptcy bill. And then when I got to the Senate in 2001, early on, there was going to be a vote on another bankruptcy bill. I was deluged \u2014 now as a senator, not as a first lady lobbying and working against this bill, I was deluged by women's groups and children's groups because the version of the bill that was going to be voted on did not protect child support, did not protect vulnerable women and their children from what would happen to them if their partner, their spouse went into bankruptcy and was able to discharge those obligations. And, you know, literally, people I had worked with for 30 years came and said nobody else will do this. You've got to help us. We've got to change that provision. I took that on. And I went to the floor. And I buttonholed the Democrats and the Republicans who were leading that bill. I said, you can't do this. You've got to change that provision. And they did. But they also put it to me. They said, if we change this provision, you have to vote for the bill. Now, that's what happens sometimes. I didn't like the bill any more than I had liked it before. It still had very bad provision. But I also pushed hard for a deal to protect women and children. So OK, I held my nose. I voted for it. It never became law. When it came back in 2005, I was against it. I didn't actually get to vote against it because Bill was in the hospital with another heart procedure, but I put out a statement on the floor. You can look at what I said in 2001. You can look at what I said in 2005. And so I'm glad to set this record straight. You know, but this kind of attack by innuendo, insinuation is really getting old. You know, hey can't point to anything. They are grabbing at straws to make this case. But let's ask Senator Sanders' campaign, why did he vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives? One of the key reasons for the Lehman brothers being over leveraged, collapsing and helping to bring down the economy. You know, this is a debate that we should be having about what our public records are and where we stand. I have the toughest, most effective campaign plan to take on the entire financial industry. I don't understand why he doesn't join me. Because it goes a lot further than anything he is proposing. We have to look at the shadow banking industry. Everybody knows where I stand on this. So I think we should end with the smear and the insinuation and talk about our respective plans.\nTAPPER: A lot of your supporters were very upset this last week when some older male pundits suggested that you are a shouter. Now, I would observe \u2014 I would observe that Bernie Sanders doesn't exactly talk in a whisper. But that said, do you think that \u2014 do you think that the coverage of you is sexist? Do you think that when male pundits say things like that, they have a different standard for you?\nCLINTON: And I don't want to single anybody out, Jake. Look, we are still living with a double standard and I know it. Every woman I know knows it. Whether you're in the media as a woman, or you're in the professions or business or politics. And I don't know anything other to do than to just keep forging through it and just taking the slings and arrows that come with being a woman in the arena. You know, sometimes I talk soft. Sometimes I get passionate and I get a little bit excited. I don't know any man who doesn't do the same thing. And I find it sort of interesting that all of a sudden this is a big discussion about me, once again. I'm so used to this. I'm going to keep making my case. I'm going to keep talking about what I will do as president. I'm going to keep laying out my record. Because I think it's really important that this election be actually about who can do the job that needs to be done starting in January of 2017.\nTAPPER: Last question, madam secretary. How has this experience of running for president changed you, if it has?\nCLINTON: You know, I think the most amazing learning experience. And having gone through this now twice, I think I am a different person than I was back in '08. I think that the experience I had as secretary of state has given me a perspective and an understanding of a lot of the issues that is deep and gives me the confidence to know that I can do every part of the job. But you run at different points in a country's, you know, thinking. And right now we're at a time when people are on both sides, Republicans, Democrats, right, left, people are really worried that our economy isn't working for them, that our government isn't working for them. And that's causing a lot of the anger and the frustration. I totally get that. I feel it. You know, things have been going on that are just wrong. These Supreme Court decisions against voting rights, Citizens United \u2014 those are dramatically altering the balance of power in our country. The great recession, for which there were a number of causes, but you have to look at the failure of the Bush administration to regulate what was going on in the financial and mortgage markets. People deserve to be upset. But what I'm saying \u2014 and maybe it's not the most popular theme these days. You know, get angry, vent, but then realize anger is not a plan and venting is not a strategy, and we have work to do. And I'm confident we can do that work. But we're going to have to roll up our sleeves and say OK, we've got to make sure the economy works for everybody, not just those at the top. Here's my plan for jobs and raising incomes. We've got to make sure the Affordable Care Act gets the cost down, but gets coverage to 100 percent. Here's what I can do about that. Let's have a discussion about what you would be thinking if you were conducting a job interview. OK, I've got the experience, I've got the passion. And here's what I'm going to do with it. And that's what I think the country needs, because people are just whipping them up. I mean, on the Republican side, all of this rhetoric, this demagoguery, which plays to the fears and the insecurities that people feel. And I just think that's not who we are. We are the premier problem-solvers of human history. We've got to get back to doing that together.\nTAPPER: All right, Madam Secretary. We'll see you on the campaign trail. Good luck on Tuesday.\nCLINTON: I'll be there. Thank you.\nTAPPER: Thanks so much for stopping by. Appreciate it.\nCLINTON: Nice to talk to you.\n","146":"\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We're joined now by his [Sanders] opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She joins us now from Manchester, as well. Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us this morning. So you have had your own turn on \"Saturday Night Live.\" How did he do?\nCLINTON: Well, I didn't get to see it, but it's always a fun experience. I'm sure he did great. You know, it's a wonderful forum. It's a crash course in trying to figure out how to do live TV. And I had a great time doing it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We also had, of course, the Republican debate last night here at St. Anselm's. And Marco Rubio called you out on the issue of abortion. Take a look.\n[begin video clip]\nMARCO RUBIO: Why doesn't the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child? Why don't they ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that partial birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks that's a fundamental right. They are the extremists when it comes to the issue of abortion and I can't wait to expose them in a general election.\n[end video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Are you going to get exposed in a general election?\nCLINTON: You know, George, I \u2014 it's really quite sad to see what Senator Rubio is becoming in this campaign. Everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can. You know, I've been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion, how it should be safe and legal and I have the same position that I've had for a very long time. But what's really going on here is an effort by the Republicans to keep pushing as far as they can to overturn \"Roe v. Wade,\" to defund Planned Parenthood, to make accusations and attacks that are really extreme...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But are there any...\nCLINTON: \u2014 and I \u2014 I think the Amer...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: \u2014 restrictions you would accept on late-term abortions?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, I've been on the record on this for a long time. You know, I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account. And, you know, when he raises the, you know, very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons. I've met women who have had to face this excruciating choice. This is not something that anyone that I've ever met with enters into without the deepest thought, the most careful consideration. And I remember at an event back in the '90s, where, you know, we sat and talked with some of the women who had to make a very hard decision. You know, it's \u2014 it's just so unfortunate that politicians like Senator Rubio are trying to politicize these kinds of very difficult concerns.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You...\nCLINTON: And I don't think he should be allowed to get away with that.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You had your own debate with Bernie Sanders this week, as well. And he challenged \u2014 you challenged him to come up with evidence that contributions from Wall Street ever influenced your positions. He and his team have circulated the charge from Elizabeth Warren, who said you changed your position on the bankruptcy bill back in 2001 because of contributions. Here's what Senator Warren had to say.\n[begin video clip]\nELIZABETH WARREN: One of the first bills that came up after she was Senator Clinton was the bankruptcy bill.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And?\nWARREN: She voted in favor of it. She has taken money from the groups. And more to the point, she worries about them as a constituency.\n[end video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How do you respond to that charge?\nCLINTON: Well, I'm glad you asked me about it, because this is one of these, you know, innuendo insinuation charges that the Sanders campaign is engaging in.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that was Senator Warren, though.\nCLINTON: If you \u2014 no, but \u2014 but I know. But if you had played the entire quote, you know, what you would have heard her say, she and I worked together in 2000 to stop a bankruptcy bill that we both believed was very harmful. When I got to the Senate in 2001, one of the first big votes there was on a version of the bankruptcy bill and I was deluged by women's groups and children's advocates groups to do everything I could to make sure that child support and women's precarious financial situation in case of divorce or not being able to get the kind of funding they needed from a partner or a spouse in bankruptcy would not be endangered. And it was. The current \u2014 that bill was making it a very low priority. So I did go to work on behalf of all these women's groups and children's groups because they needed a champion. And I got that bill changed. And in return, it had nothing to do with any money whatsoever \u2014 and I resent deeply any effort by the Sanders campaign to so imply...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But...\nCLINTON: It had to do with trying to get a deal...\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But that's not what...\nCLINTON: \u2014 that would protect women. But now let me finish, George, because this has been bandied about and I just want to set the record straight. And so then three years later, part of the \u2014 part of what Senator \u2014 Senator Warren said, you played. You didn't play the whole thing, because we've been allies. I faced a tough decision and I stood up for women and children. I went to the Senate floor, said that was exactly what I was doing. Then the bill did not pass. It never became law. And then when the next bill came up, 2005, women's issues were taken care of because I had made that a point back in 2001. And so then I was against that bill. I didn't get a chance to actually vote against it because Bill was in the hospital having a heart procedure. But I put a statement out. I was against it. So I'm happy to set this record straight. And I really want to, once again, call out the Sanders campaign, which claims they like to run a positive campaign. But they have been quite artful in raising questions and trying to cast doubts about my record. And I really am not going to sit and take it anymore \u2014\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But Senator \u2014\nCLINTON: I have a public record. I have never, ever been influenced in a view or a vote by anyone who has given me any kind of money. So I'm just going to keep setting the record straight.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But in her book, Senator Warren said the bill was essentially the same but Hillary Clinton \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton was not. Big banks were now part of Secretary Clinton's consistency. She wanted their support. They wanted hers, including \u2014\nCLINTON: George, look, I \u2014 look, I have the greatest \u2014 I have the greatest respect for Senator Warren. As I said, we did work together. I faced a choice. I could have said to the women who have been my advocates for 30 years, I'm sorry; I'm now in the Senate. But you know, I can't help you. Nobody else is helping them. They were desperate to get help. They were afraid that child support was going to be below credit card debt, that they were going to be really left out and left behind and badly damaged. I could have said, you know, I can't do that because somebody in 10 years might say that, you know, something else is going on. That's not the way I work. So they came to me; I said this is outrageous. I went to the floor. I lobbied to get a change. And as part of getting that change from both Democrats and Republicans, who were leading that legislation, they said if we change this bill at the last minute to take account of these issues you're raising about women and children, which they had not clearly made a priority before I showed up, then you know, you have to say you'll vote for it. It was \u2014 you know, look, that's what you have to do. I swallowed hard; I said OK. But it was also the case it didn't get passed. So I got what I needed into the bill. It stayed in the bill, even in the bad version that I posed in 2005. So thanks for the opportunity to set the record straight.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: In the debate the other night, you said you'd look into whether or not to release the transcripts of your speeches to financial groups. Have you made up your mind?\nCLINTON: Yes, you know, here's another thing I want to say. Let everybody who's ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them. We'll all release them at the same time. You know, I don't mind being the subject in Republican debates, the subject in the Democratic primary. That kind of goes with the territory. I've been around long enough. But at some point, you know, these rules need to apply to everybody. And there are a bunch of folks, including, you know, my opponent, who's given, you know, speeches to groups and people on the other side who've given speeches to groups. Let \u2014 if this is now going to be a new standard so then it should apply to everybody and then I'll be happy to look into it further.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for your time this morning.\nCLINTON: Great to talk to you, George, thanks.\n","147":"\nCOOPER: And welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire. Thanks very much for being with us. You heard from Senator Bernie Sanders. Please welcome the former secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. [applause]\nPlease.\nCLINTON: Hello.\nCOOPER: Welcome.\nCLINTON: Thank you very much.\nCOOPER: So you've obviously had a pretty incredible several past couple of days. Congratulations on winning in Iowa. New Hampshire has always been good to the Clintons. How does it feel out there?\nCLINTON: It feels great. I've had just an amazing time. We landed in the middle of the night from Iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there, and then got to work the next day. And I'm seeing a lot of old friends, meeting a lot of new people. I have an uphill climb and I'm going to climb as high and hard as I can because I want to make my case for the people of New Hampshire. As you said, they're people that I feel very close to. They've been good to my husband, to me, my family. But what's most important is the first in the nation primary. It truly is a great opportunity to get out there, explain what you want to do as president, present your ideas, and get vetted by the people of New Hampshire.\nCOOPER: Bernie Sanders, just a short time ago, said he is the underdog here. Your campaign has said, you know, he comes from neighboring Vermont, you guys are down in the polls. Do you feel you do better when you're fighting from behind?\nCLINTON: You know, I don't know. I...\nCOOPER: Does it bring out something in you?\nCLINTON: Well, the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey what's at stake in this election, because to me obviously Tuesday is a really big deal with the primary. But the goal has to be to prevent the Republicans from getting back into the White House and undoing all the progress that has been made under President Obama. [applause]\nAnd so I \u2014 I'm very proud of the campaign that Senator Sanders and I are running. I mean, we really have focused on issues. We share a lot of the same big progressive goals, but we have different ways of going about them. We bring different experiences. But we are contrasting on issues, compared to the Republicans who, I think, are contrasting on insults. And I think it's a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout New Hampshire, get questions, have people vet them, and then let the voters make up their minds.\nCOOPER: You've talked about progressive values. Earlier in the day Senator Sanders was asked if you were progressive. He said some days. Are you really a progressive? In the past you have said you plead guilty to being a moderate.\nCLINTON: Well, you know, you asked me this question in the first debate, right?\nCOOPER: I did. And it's coming up again today.\nCLINTON: And I said that I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign, Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive, Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive, even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive. So I'm not going to let that bother me. I know where I stand. I know who stands with me. I know what I've done. But I don't think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved. And I don't think it's appropriate that, you know, if Planned Parenthood endorses me or the Human Rights Campaign endorses me, you know, they're thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment. That's just not anything we need to do. Let's have a good contest of ideas. Let's contrast where we stand. And that's what I intend to do for the next couple of days.\nCOOPER: It would obviously be historic if you were elected president, first female president.\nCLINTON: You think so? [laughter] [applause]\nCOOPER: I've studied a little bit of history. But it seems like young women aren't rallying to this potentially historic moment. And I say this in Iowa, among women under 30, Senator Sanders beat you by 70 points. Why do you think that is?\nCLINTON: That's amazing. Yes. Look, you know, I was very fortunate to have a great team of young people, men and women, supporting me. But I accept the fact that I have work to do to convey what I stand for, what I've accomplished, what I want to do for young people in our country.\nCOOPER: Why do you think it is? That they're...\nCLINTON: But I \u2014 well, you know, I don't really know, Anderson. I think \u2014 here's what I want young people to know. They don't have to be for me, I'm going to be for them. It doesn't really matter. [applause]\nIf they are not supporting me, I will be their president, I will do everything I can to give them the opportunities they deserve.\nAs I speak with young people across the country in Iowa, New Hampshire, and elsewhere, I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged, put on the wrong side of American opportunity. And I understand that. I mean the student debt problems, the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get. But at the same time I'm so impressed by the level, the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination, going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that LGBT community members have, looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment, fighting climate change. So I'm impressed with them. And I'm going to do everything I can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important. But you've got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people. I have a lot experience doing that. I think I can deliver positive change for young people in our country. And I hope to have the chance to win their support.\nCOOPER: What's wrong with a revolution?\nCLINTON: Well, that's for Sen. Sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people. I have a different take on it. I think the progress that we have made, and particularly the Democratic Party has made, has been hard fought for, hard won and must be defended. So I want to defend the Affordable Care Act. It is one of the great accomplishments, not only of this president, but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman. [applause] The Republicans are... [applause] You know, the Republicans are determined to repeal it. And they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies. Sen. Sanders and I share the same goal. We want to get to universal health care coverage. Before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare, as you remember.\nCOOPER: I remember.\nCLINTON: I fought really hard. The insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me. I know what it's like to go up against the status quo and special interests. So when President Obama succeeded, I was thrilled. I don't agree with Sen. Sanders that we should start over, that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again. We're at 90 percent coverage. I'm going to fix what needs to be fixed. We're going to move from 90 to 100, which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100. So we have a difference. And I think that... [applause] ... is the difference.\nCOOPER: I want you to meet some of the folks in our audience.\nCLINTON: Sure.\nCOOPER: This is Dave Skinell. He's a high school English teacher from Manchester. He says he's undecided. David?\nCLINTON: Hi, David.\nQUESTION: Hi, Sec. Clinton. You \u2014 the next president will have as many as three Supreme Court appointments to make.\nCLINTON: Right.\nQUESTION: I'm wondering beyond abortion are there any issues on which you would impose or assert a litmus test. And if your answer is no, aren't certain critical issues like marriage equality, campaign finance just so vital to what we believe in as Democrats that you would have to know the answer as to how these justices would rule before you make the nomination?\nCLINTON: Well, I'll tell you what, Dave. I do have a litmus test. I have a bunch of litmus tests because I agree with you. The next president could get as many as three appointments. You know one of the many reasons why we can't turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court. I'm looking for people who understand the way the real world works, who don't have a kneejerk reaction to support business, to support the idea that you know money is speech, that gutted the Voting Rights Act. I voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act when I was in the Senate. It passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research. Supreme Court comes along. They substitute their judgment for the Congress, signed by George W. Bush. That is one of our problems. They have a view that I just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is. So they have given way too much power to corporations. They have given Citizens United, the biggest gift to the Koch brothers, Karl Rove and all of those folks whose values I don't share, and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back. We have to preserve marriage equality. We have to go further to end discrimination against the LGBT community... [applause] We've got to make sure... [applause] We've got to make sure to preserve Roe v. Wade, not let it be nibbled away or repealed.\nWe've got work to do... [applause] And here's how I think about it, because when I was a senator, I had to vote on Supreme Court justices. I'm looking for people who are rooted in the real world, who know that part of the genius of our system, both economic and government, is this balance of power. If it gets too far out of whack, so that business has too much power, any branch of the government has too much power, the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it. So I have very strong feelings about what I'll be looking for if I am given the honor of appointing somebody to the Supreme Court. [applause]\nCOOPER: OK. [applause]\nI want you to meet Mr. Jim Kinhan. He's a Democrat who says he is supporting you.\nJIM KINHAN: Hello, Madam Secretary.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nKINHAN: I'm very pleased to see you. This may come a little bit from right field, this may seem, but it's very personal to me and resonates probably with many other people who are elderly dealing with health issues. The question is coming to me as a person who is walking with colon cancer. And I'm walking with colon cancer with the word terminal very much in my vocabulary, comfortably and spiritually. But I wonder what leadership you could offer within an executive role that might help advance the respectful conversation that is needed around this personal choice that people may make, as we age and deal with health issues or be the caregivers of those people, to help enhance and \u2014 their end of life with dignity.\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, thank you for being here. Thank you so much for being part of this great New Hampshire primary process and thank you for support. And I really appreciate your asking the question. And I have to tell you, this is the first time I've been asked that question.\nKINHAN: I \u2014 I figured that.\nCLINTON: Yes. I \u2014 I really \u2014 I really...\nKINHAN: Maybe any candidate.\nCLINTON: And I thank you for it, because we need to have a conversation in our country. There are states, as you know...\nKINHAN: Yes.\nCLINTON: \u2014 that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision, in consultation by their families, even, in some cases, with medical professionals. But the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors. So it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical, religious, faith-based perspective. So here's how I think about it. I want \u2014 I want, as president, to try to catalyze that debate because I \u2014 I believe you're right, this is going to become an issue more and more...\nKINHAN: Exactly.\nCLINTON: \u2014 often. We are, on the good side, having many people live longer, but often, then, with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on, but at some point, don't want to continue with the challenges that poses. So I don't have any easy or glib answer for you. I think I would want to really immerse myself in the \u2014 the \u2014 the ethical writings, the health writings, the scientific writings, the religious writings. I know some other countries, the Netherlands and others, have a quite open approach. I'd like to know what their experience has been. Because we \u2014 we have to be sure that nobody is coerced, nobody is under duress. And that is a difficult line to draw. So I thank you \u2014 I thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that we're all going to have to do some thinking about.\nKINHAN: Thank you [inaudible]. [applause]\nCOOPER: I think this is Michael Feel. Michael is a married father of one. He says he's undecided. He's learning \u2014 leaning toward Senator Sanders. Michael?\nCLINTON: Hi, Michael.\nMICHAEL FEEL: Hi, Secretary Clinton. As senator and as secretary of State, you have a history of interventionist foreign policy that is troubling to many Democratic voters, including myself. As a voter who is opposed to the United States being the world's policeman, can you assure me that as president, you would not expand our military involvement abroad?\nCLINTON: No, I can't, Michael. I mean I \u2014 I'd like to be able to say I could, but here's what I can say. I have learned and have been, you know, really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years. And military force must always be a last resort not a first choice. That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans.\nI worked very hard as secretary of State to do what I could diplomatically to avoid conflict. That's why I worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in Iran, so that we could get them to the negotiating table, in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place. I did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region, and maybe even led to conflict. I will do everything I possibly can to avoid sending American troops abroad, getting us involved in military conflicts. But I can't in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that I served as President where it very well might be in America's best vital national security interest. So I want to be honest with you. I will do what I can, I will stand against adventurism, ill thought out missions. I will not send American combat troops to Iraq or Syria. That is off the table. That would be a terrible mistake. We will continue to use Special Forces, and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face. You know, the network of terrorist organizations \u2014 not just ISIS, but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from North Africa to South Asia \u2014 pose serious threats to friends, allies, and partners, as well as to ourselves. And we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat ISIS, to end that terrorist threat. So I will be a very careful, deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices, because I know what's at stake. And I know you can understand why there can't be from me anyway a blanket statement. But I want to assure you I will be transparent, I will be open, and I will explain to the American people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners.\nCOOPER: I want to follow up the \u2014 yesterday on Capitol Hill the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Commander of the Marine Corps said that he thinks, and I quote, all eligible and qualified men and women should register for the draft, talking about Selective Service. Do you think women should also have to register for Selective Service, like men?\nCLINTON: You know the first time I heard that yesterday and here's the reasoning, as best I, I understand from listening to the testimony excerpts. That, if we're going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be Army Rangers, they can compete to be Navy Seals, they can compete to be Infantry Officers in the Marines, then we have expanded the definition of the all-volunteer military. I, I have to think about whether I think it's necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending. You know, from my perspective, the all-volunteer military has worked, and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country. The idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where that's going to come out. Where I want people to register, I want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically, and I think if \u2014 if we had, you know, if we had a system like that I would, I would be very, very pleased about it. I have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the Selective Service system. So I just have to be better informed about why they're making this recommendation.\nCOOPER: I want you to meet Rebecca Hutchinson. She's a former State Representative in New Hampshire. She says she's undecided and she's got a question for you.\nCLINTON: Hi, Rebecca.\nREBECCA HUTCHINSON: Thank you. I feel in a way I sort of have a follow-up to the previous question. You clearly have very impressive foreign policy experience, and I've heard you point out to us that President Obama chose you and trusted you to be his Secretary of State. But I get stuck when I think about you voted for the Iraq war, which you now say was a mistake. What have you learned since that vote that could give me confidence that you wouldn't make a mistake of that magnitude again?\nCLINTON: Oh, I think that's a very fair question. You know, I did make a mistake and I admitted that I made a mistake. And in large measure that mistake really arose from the Bush administration's approach to what they thought they could accomplish in Iraq. The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections. And he made that comment. And the U.N. Inspector Hans Blix said, give us the time, we will find out. Give us the hammer over their head, namely the vote, and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of WMD. And the Bush administration didn't give them the time. And that was a breach of faith, in my view. But you know I gave them the vote, in large measure because I thought that would give us the time and we would find out, short of invasion. Turned out not to be. And I really regret that that's the way President Bush proceeded. That would not be something you would have to worry about with me. If I tell you we're going to do diplomacy, we're going to hang tough, we're going to get answers, that's exactly what we will do.\nCOOPER: I want you to meet Sean Burke. He's a Democrat from Derry, says he is a supporter of yours. Sean?\nCLINTON: Hi, Sean.\nQUESTION: Hey. Once you become the nominee and got elected, how are you going to defend yourself against right-wing attacks?\nCLINTON: Well, Sean, I had a lot of practice. [laughter and applause] So I could laugh up here, but it's not easy. It is a brutal experience. And when it first started happening to me back in the early 1990s when I was working on health care. And you know I was just unrecognizable to myself. What talk radio was saying, what Republican members of Congress and their allies were saying. I was just stunned. I could not understand how they got away with it. And I have had to learn to take criticism seriously, but not personally. And by that I mean this. The very fair question from Rebecca. People ask you questions or criticize you, think about it seriously. There are lessons to be learned, often from people who don't agree with you. But don't take it personally so that it just paralyzes you, literally stops you in your tracks. And so now that I've been through this for so many years, Sean, my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed. They play to keep. They play to destroy. They are constantly doing whatever they can to win. And they have a history now going back, you know, 35-36 years of going after people who they believe they can't otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack. So right now, for example, a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super PAC to run ads against me. Karl Rove has you know solicited money from Wall Street to run ads against me. I view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know I mean what I say and I will do what I say. And I will stand in their way and I will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on America that is bad for our democracy, bad for our economy, bad for our societies. So I know I have to keep defending against them. But I'm the one who has the experience to do that. It's unlike anything you've ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue, terrible attacks. And now the Koch brothers say they're going to spend $750 million to defeat the Democratic nominee. I'm still standing, and I will be standing. So don't worry about that. [applause]\nCOOPER: Let me just simply follow up. You mentioned attacks on the early 1990s.\nCLINTON: Right.\nCOOPER: Do you still believe there's a vast right-wing conspiracy?\nCLINTON: Don't you? [laughter]\nCOOPER: I'm asking you.\nCLINTON: Yes. It's gotten even better funded. You know they brought in some new multibillionaires to pump the money in.\nAnd look, these guys play for keeps. They want to control our country. Senator Sanders and I agree on that completely. They want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer, they could care less about income inequality. They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy, and, you know, getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to. But make no mistake, they want to destroy unions. They want to go after any economic interests that they don't believe they can control. They want to destroy our balance of power. They want to go after our political system and fill it with people who will do their bidding. I said today in Dover, you know, I don't think all of the Republican candidates are so ill-informed about climate change that they say they don't know because they're not scientists. They're just doing the bidding of the Koch brothers. They're told don't you dare say climate change is real because we're in the fossil fuel business. So this is exactly what they are up to. And, yes... [applause] ... it is probably \u2014 look, at this point it's probably not correct to say it's a conspiracy because it's out in the open. You know, there is no doubt about what they're doing and who the players are and what they're trying to achieve. And they're shopping among the Republican candidates to figure out who among them will most likely do their bidding. So just know what we're up against because it's real and we're going to beat it. But it's going to take everybody working together. [applause]\nCOOPER: I want you to meet Alison Pyott. She's an independent torn between you and Senator Sanders.\nCLINTON: Hi, Alison.\nALISON PYOTT: I'm sensing a theme here. First, thank you so much for all you've done for our country and for women.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nPYOTT: My question is the number of factors, some you have just described, have eroded trust in you. What will you do to regain that trust, engender trust in Americans and me?\nCLINTON: Well, thank you for starting by saying it's related to what I just said. And I acknowledge this as personally painful as it is. When you have been subjected to the level, the velocity of attacks that come every day, even if there is no factual basis to it, it's just normal for people to say, gosh, there has got to be something, why do they keep saying this and then we do that. And, you know, I testify for 11 hours, there's nothing to Benghazi, they don't give it up, they keep coming after it. So I know that I have to really demonstrate as clearly as I can who I am, what I stand for, and what I've always done. I've always been guided by the same values. I have always listened to people. And I've always worked as hard as I could to produce results for people. So when I ran for the Senate the first time and I was out there and, you know, people were barraging, I was running first against Rudy Giuliani and all of that. And I was able to just keep going and tell people, here's who I am, here's what I do, I want to do this with you. And I won. And then since years later when I ran, I got a higher percentage. And then I did have, as you all remember, a really tough campaign against then-Senator Obama. We saw each other very up close and personal. And he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state, because he trusts me, he trusts my judgment, he trusts my experience. So all I can do is to just get up every day and work to do what I believe our country needs, find ways to help people, whether it's on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans, whatever it might be. And I trust the American people. I trust the people of New Hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that I will work my heart out for you. And that's what I hope you will understand. [applause]\nCOOPER: I want to welcome Rabbi Jonathan Spira-Savett. He's an independent, says he's undecided about his vote. Rabbi?\nCLINTON: Hello, Rabbi.\nRABBI JONATHAN SPIRA-SAVETT: Hello. Another rabbi, Rabbi Simcha Bunem taught that every person has to have two pockets and in each pocket they have to carry a different note. And the note in one pocket says the universe was created for me. And in the other pocket the note says I am just dust and ashes. And I want you to take a moment and think about what you would tell us about your two pockets.\nHow do you cultivate the ego, the ego that we all know you must have, a person must have to be the leader of the free world, and also the humility to recognize that we know that you can't be expected to be wise about all the things that the president has to be responsible for?\nCLINTON: Another absolutely wonderful question. Thank you, Rabbi. I think about this a lot. Um, I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith, that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility, about service and self-gratification, all of the human questions that all of us deal with, but when you put yourself out into the public arena, I think it's incumbent upon you to be as self- conscious as possible. This is hard for me. You know, I never thought I'd be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president. I always wanted to be of service. I met my husband, who was such a natural, knew exactly what he wanted to do. I was happy to support him while I worked in the Children's Defense Fund and legal services and taught law, and, you know, had our daughter. I never thought I would do this. And so I have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what I want to do for other people, or to tell stories about, you know, the man I met in Rochester who \u2014 whose AIDS medicine is no longer affordable. And that \u2014 that can grip me and make me feel like there's something I can do about that. So I'm constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States not lose track of who I am, what I believe in and what I want to do to serve? I have that dialogue at least, you know, once a day in some setting or another. And I don't know that there is any ever absolute answer, like, OK, universe, here I am, watch me roar or oh, my gosh, I can't do it, it's just overwhelming, I have to retreat. It's that balance that I keep to try to find in my life that I want to see back in our country. And it will be something that I continue to talk about with a \u2014 you know, with a group of faith advisers who are close to me. I get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with. And, you know, it just gets me grounded. He gets up really early to send it to me. So, you know, there it is in my in box at 5:00 a.m.. I have friends who are rabbis who send me notes, give me readings that are going to be discussed in services. So I really appreciate all that incoming. And the final thing I would say, because again, it's not anything I've ever talked about this much publicly, everybody knows I \u2014 I have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years. And so I've had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues, political, public issues. And I read a, um, a treatment of the prodigal son parable by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen, who I think is a magnificent writer of spiritual and theological concerns. And I \u2014 I read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me. And it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude. So regardless of how hard the days are, how difficult the decisions are, be grateful. Be grateful for being a human being, being part of the universe. Be grateful for your limitations. Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you, to support you, to advise you, listen to your critics, answer the questions. But at the end, be grateful. Practice the discipline of gratitude. And that has helped me enormously. [applause]\nCOOPER: We're going to have more questions from the audience for Secretary Clinton when we come back.\nWe'll take a short break.\n[commercial break]\nCOOPER: Welcome back to CNN's Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire. We are here with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. I want to play a piece of video...\nCLINTON: OK.\nCOOPER: ...from Senator Sanders the other night in Iowa after the votes came in, and get you to respond.\nCLINTON: OK.\n[begin video clip]\nSANDERS: We do not represent the interests of the billionaire class, Wall Street, or corporate America. We don't want their money. We will... And I am very proud to tell you that we are the only candidate on the Democratic side without a Super PAC. And the reason that we have done so well here in Iowa, the reason I believe we're going to do so well in New Hampshire, and in the other states that follow, the reason is the American people are saying no to a rigged economy.\n[end video clip]\nCOOPER: We got a number of questions, even from people who support your policies, who say they do believe that you represent the interests of Wall Street and corporate America. How do you respond?\nCLINTON: Well, look, that's just not the case. And I did represent New York, obviously.\nThere was no doubt that I took on a lot of what was going down on Wall Street, including calling them out on the mortgage issues, calling for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau even before we got one created, calling for changes in CEO pay. But I honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody that I know who looks at what's happening in this campaign sees the same thing. The Wall Street interests, the money interests, the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me. So I just find it kind of a strange argument. I happen to agree with Sen. Sanders. I'm not just going after Wall Street though. I think that's too narrow a target. I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe. It's a perversion. It should be stopped. I want to go after the hedge funds that have bought up drug companies, you know Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Turing Pharmaceuticals, taking drugs that have been around a long time and upping the price. So I take seriously the obligation that I would have as president once again to try to get the deck un-stacked, to get the odds favoring the average American again... [applause] And but I just have to \u2014 I have to respectfully say, I think Sen. Sanders' target is too small, I really do. You know I respect him going after the big banks. I agree with him. No bank is too big to fail. No executive to powerful to jail. But we actually passed the process to be able to take on banks that pose excessive risk in our financial system in Dodd-Frank. So let's know the next president has to implement, but doesn't have to achieve that. Here's what I want to do. I want to go after all the other culprits. It wasn't just the big banks. It was the insurance company AIG. It was the investment bank Lehman Brothers. It was Countrywide Mortgage. It was Wachovia. There were a lot of bad actors. And if all you do is look over here, I'm telling you, they're going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk. So I've got no argument that we need to take on these vested interests. I just have a wider group that I think we need to go after, from pharmaceuticals... [applause] ... insurance companies, shadow banking and other corporations that I think are undermining our ecoomy. And frankly they are undermining our democracy. This Johnson Controls thing really infuriates me. We bailed them out. The Republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail. They didn't care about the millions of jobs. Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress gave them a bailout. It turned out to be a good deal. All of us paid for it. They paid back the Treasury. So we didn't lose any money and we saved millions of jobs. And the auto industry just had a great year. Johnson Controls was one of those begging for the bailout. And now they're not going to pay their taxes? We're going to go right after that. That is absolutely wrong. [applause] And we need to be focused on getting a fix for that. [applause]\nCOOPER: One of the things... [applause] One of the things that Sen. Sanders points to and a lot of your critics point to is you made three speeches for Goldman Sachs. You were paid $675,000 for three speeches. Was that a mistake? I mean was that a bad error in judgment?\nCLINTON: Look. I made speeches to lots of groups. I told them what I thought. I answered questions.\nCOOPER: But did you have to be paid $675,000?\nCLINTON: Well, I don't know. That's what they offered, so...[laughter] You know every secretary of State that I know has done that.\nCOOPER: But [inaudible] for office they're not running for an office...\nCLINTON: Well, I didn't know...\nCOOPER: ... have known.\nCLINTON: To be honest I wasn't \u2014 I wasn't committed to running. I didn't know whether I would or not.\nCOOPER: You didn't think you were going to run for president again?\nCLINTON: I didn't. You know when I was secretary of State several times I said you know I think I'm done. And you know, so many people came to me, started talking to me. The circumstances, the concerns I had about the Republicans taking back the White House, because I think they wrecked what we achieved in the 1990s with 23 million new jobs and incomes going up for everybody. I did not want to see that happen again. I want to defend President Obama's accomplishments and the progress we've made. I want to go further. So yes, I was convinced. But you know anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me, name anything they've influenced me on. Just name one thing. I'm out here every day saying I'm going to shut them down, I'm going after them. I'm going to jail them if they should be jailed. I'm going to break them up. I mean they're not giving me very much money now. I can tell you that much. [laughter] Fine with me.\nI'm proud to have 90 percent of my donations from small donors and 60 percent, the highest ever, from women, which I'm really, really glad about. [applause]\nCOOPER: So just to be clear, that's not something you regret, those three speeches, that money?\nCLINTON: No, I don't, because, you know, I don't feel that I paid any price for it and I am very clear about what I will do and they're on notice.\nCOOPER: I want to see if Chris Lopez is here. Chris, there you are. Chris is an independent with a question for Secretary Clinton. She says she's undecided, I should point out. Chris?\nCLINTON: Hi, Chris.\nCHRIS LOPEZ: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I see a lot of hypocrisy in this country when I have a really hard time getting the medicine I need and yet it's really easy to get alcohol. What will you do to decriminalize marijuana so people \u2014 so I and people like me can get the pain and spasm relief that we need?\nCLINTON: I will do a lot, Chris, because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana, what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions you've just briefly described. I want to move it from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II so that we can begin to do more research. The NIH and a lot of universities can begin to try to find out. Because I want you to know what we know from science. But I also want you to be able to use it while we're doing the research. And so many states, as you know, have moved to provide legal protection for the use of medical marijuana. I support that. I think that the states are the laboratories of our democracy. We should be learning about what works, what doesn't work. Different states have actually listed the kind of illnesses and conditions that it can be used for. Are they right? We don't know. That's why we have got to do the research. I also want you to know what dosage is right, what interacts with the other medication you're taking. I want to accelerate this because I have no doubt that there are very real benefits for people. We know in chemotherapy, we know from other conditions in using the right amount of the right kind of marijuana. I just want to make sure it's the right amount and the right kind. That's why I want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible. But you said something else which I think is really important. We can't be here in New Hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in New Hampshire. Not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state. Not talk about the lives that are being destroyed, the people that I meet, the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because they've lost their children. I just left a rally in Manchester, and a woman grabbed my hand and she said, I just lost my son to an overdose. So I have been working with elected officials like Senator Shaheen, like Governor Hassan, like Governor Shumlin of Vermont, who supports me, to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach, a new law enforcement approach so that first-time, low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs? There are 23 million people who need help in our country, both alcohol and drugs. There are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people. So we've got to work on law enforcement. We have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids, which is often the first step towards heroin. We have to have every police department equipped with naloxone, which is the antidote to reverse overdose, save lives here in New Hampshire. We've got to put more money into this. So all of this to me fits together. You deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges. So that's what I would like to do. [applause]\nCOOPER: I want you to meet \u2014 this is Julie Carnigan, she's from Windham. Julie?\nCLINTON: Hi.\nJULIE CARNIGAN: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I'm the proud mother of five girls, two of my own, three step- daughters. And unfortunately they are all \"feeling the Bern.\" And I would like to know what you would do to convince them to vote for you.\nCLINTON: How old are they?\nCARNIGAN: They're in their \u2014 21, 22, and a couple of 23s and a 25-year-old. [laughter]\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, tell them I'm glad they're interested in politics, and I really mean that. I want them to be involved. I want them to feel like I felt when I was that age, some years ago, and getting excited and interested in politics for the first time.\nI also want them to take a look at my record, what I have done my entire life, starting as a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund, taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in South Carolina, trying to gather information to end segregated academies in the South. I want them to know that I was a legal services lawyers, standing up for equality under the law, defending people's rights because I believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve. And then I hope they will look at what I have accomplished from, you know, starting the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids, looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system, with very partisan Republicans when I was First Lady. Getting healthcare for our National Guard. Helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons. A long list. And the reason I say that is I think it's very important that, as people move toward the primary on Tuesday, whatever your age, you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done. And as I've said and I mean it absolutely, I have the highest respect for Senator Sanders. But as the \"Concord Monitor\" said today in its writing about this, you know, it's, it's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable. So I don't want to over promise. We've got too much of that. I want to tell people what I will do. I want to be specific because I do want to \u2014 to go back to the question I was asked earlier \u2014 recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in America. We need to set big goals again. I am all for that. I have big, ambitious goals. Affordable college, early childhood education, making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave, all of which will help your daughters. But I also want them to hold me accountable. I want them to say, OK, how's that actually going to happen? What do we have to do to make it? We've got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate. Nancy Pelosi has said, we're not going to revisit healthcare. We're going to stick with the Affordable Care Act. That's exactly where I am. We're going to improve it. Because I am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in people's lives. I am a progressive who gets results. And I will be a progressive President who gets results. And the final thing I would say is, it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young women's ambitions. And I'm going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling. I hope it splinters completely and, and I hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now, regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically. But in their lives, their profession, how they're treated. I hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment. That's what I want for my daughter and my amazing granddaughter, and that's what I want for your daughters.\nCOOPER: [inaudible]. Just as we did with Senator Sanders, we've talked about a lot of important policy issues. I just want to ask kind of a couple of personal questions just for voters to get...\nCLINTON: You don't think they know everything?\nCOOPER: Well, I don't know. We'll see about that. It's interesting to me, I mean you have \u2014 as you said, you have been one of the most famous women in the world now for, for decades. You have no anonymity. If you could be anonymous for just one day, what would you do?\nCLINTON: I used to do this in the White House and, you know, I would, I would put on a baseball cap and sunglasses and, you know, sweat pants and a sweat shirt, and put my hair back, and I would go walk. And I would tell the Secret Service they had to wear casual clothes, they had to take the things out of their ears, they had to look like they were just tourists. I had the best time, you know. I would, I would end up over on the Mall sometimes, walking around. And a family would come up and say, would you mind taking our picture in front of the White House. I'd be happy to. Here, why don't you... So, you know, there's nothing I like better than to be anonymous, as hard as that is to achieve. So I would spend the day, you know, out in nature, talking a long walk, walking through one of the beautiful towns here in New Hampshire, stopping in a cafe, stopping in a bookstore. You know, maybe calling some of my friends, some of whom are here tonight, and say, don't tell anybody but meet me, you know, there. That's what I, that's what I want to do, and it's what I get the great joy out of. I am so fortunate that I still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life. And they keep me grounded, they keep me honest, they deflate my head, they deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other. [laughter]\nSo any time I get to spend time with them. And then of course it would have to end with seeing my granddaughter because that's the creme de le resistance...\nCOOPER: What does she call you?\nCLINTON: She calls me grandma. Grandma. Yes. She's working really hard on words. And it was so thrilling. They came to Iowa that last weekend because we obviously weren't going to leave. And so they got in late the night, Saturday night. And Sunday morning I'm getting ready. And you know Bill and I are you know having coffee and everything. So Chelsea brings her in and she sees me. She goes \"grandma\". And honest to goodness, the caucus could've ended right there. I would've been perfectly happy... [applause] ... saying the best thing has happened to me right this minute in Iowa. So that's where I'd end my day.\nCOOPER: You talked about the circle of friends you have. Obviously in 2011 your mom passed away.\nCLINTON: Right.\nCOOPER: In 2008 she was part of your campaign.\nCLINTON: She was.\nCOOPER: And you wrote about how at the end of the day you would, you know, sit around the kitchen table with her, kick off your shoes and just talk about everything that had happened.\nCLINTON: Right.\nCOOPER: What do you think \u2014 what advice do you think she would give you today in this campaign in this year?\nCLINTON: You know, my mother truly is my inspiration because she had such a terrible, miserable life and was abandoned and rejected by her own family, and was out at the age of 14 working as a housemaid. And her resilience, her love, her ability to have her own family to take such good care of us was just, you know to me the ultimate accomplishment in any life. And she would always give me the advice she gave me as a little girl. You know you get knocked down. Everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get up. And when you get up, what do you do? How do you behave? Are you going to be bitter? Angry? Upset? Are you going to try to be positive, get something done, help somebody else? And I'm sure that's exactly what she'd be saying now. She'd be encouraging me. She'd be very proud, a little apprehensive because you know it's a brutal business being in politics. And people say things about those you love, whether it's your daughter or someone else. So she was very supportive. But you could tell you know how much pain she kind of absorbed from time to time. And so I would sit with her and I would say don't listen to that stuff, mom. And she'd say, well I have to know what they're saying about you. And I'd say you know don't put yourself through that. And so that would be what she'd be doing now I think too. Yes.\nCOOPER: I want you to be able to make your closing argument...\nCLINTON: Oh.\nCOOPER: ... to the people in New Hampshire.\nCLINTON: Well, thank you. Well, first of all, thanks again for being part of this process, this first in the nation primary. You know I said earlier today some people said well you know Sen. Sanders is ahead. And I respect that. And so maybe you know I should go onto the next state. And I said absolutely not. New Hampshire has been so good to me and my family. And I love campaigning in New Hampshire. I love this process. So, you're going to have to put up with me. I'm going to be going around the state, going to as many events as I can, answering as many questions, trying to talk about what I am offering. I really believe that we have a chance to build on the progress we've made and to get results for people. To get the economy producing more good jobs, to get incomes rising again, that's my goal. I will not raise middle class taxes because the middle class hasn't even yet recovered from the Great Recession. We're going to stick with the Affordable Care Act. We're going to make it work. We're going to get early childhood education, affordable college and pay down student debt, a lot of the agenda that is important to our country, particularly to young people. And we're going to defend our rights. We're going to defend a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. [applause] We're going to defend Planned Parenthood. We're going to defend marriage equality and end discrimination against LGBT Americans. And we're going to take on the gun lobby because it is absolutely unconscionable to have... [applause] ... 33,000 people a year die from gun violence. [applause] So please, join me in this campaign. I hope you will come out and vote for me on Tuesday. And I will fight for you every single day in the White House. Thank you all very much. [cheers and applause]\nCOOPER: I want to thank both candidates for coming tonight, the voters for being here and asking such amazing questions... [applause] And the viewers at home. I also want to thank everybody with the Derry Opera House for their hospitality...[cheers] With the New Hampshire primaries now just days away, a reminder we'll be here for it all with [inaudible] expert analysis... [applause] Our coverage continues with Don Lemon right after this. [cheers] Thanks again.\nCLINTON: Thank you all. [applause] Thank you, guys. [applause]\n","148":"\nMATTHEWS: Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us. It was quite a night last night and I was taken with your moment of candor there before the cameras when you said, you had a sigh of relief. Tell us about that sigh of relief and what it meant to you.\nCLINTON: Right. Oh, Chris, it meant the world to me. As we all remember, I was not successful in Iowa last time and I know how hard that caucus process is. So proud of our organization, our volunteers, all my supporters. Everybody said if there were a big turnout, that would advantage Senator Sanders. There was a big turnout, and we won. And now I'm in New Hampshire looking forward to the primary next Tuesday and continuing to make my case in this contest of ideas between me and the senator.\nMATTHEWS: Well, you know, \"The New York Times\" ran this story this morning that you were disappointed, and I think it's possible to be both disappointed and relieved. You could have been disappointed at 9:00 but very relieved at 11:00. I mean, the times change during the course as the results come in. Are both those possible? You thought you could have done better with your field operation but you're also glad you came out ahead?\nCLINTON: Look, Chris, I really believe that during the last few weeks leading up to the caucus, I could feel the energy building. It's a tough process and what I was seeing on the ground as people were telling me they were changing their minds, that they were supporting me, what my organizers were reporting, was all consistent that it was going to be close, but if we did our work, and we did, we would win. So I was thrilled by winning and getting that boost out of Iowa here in New Hampshire where I am in Senator Sanders' backyard, as you know, as a political expert of your many years, that New Hampshire votes for neighbors. And so I have to really get out there, make my case, which I intend to do this week.\nMATTHEWS: I just love the way you snuck that in. It's his backyard, therefore he has an advantage geographically and we shouldn't put too much stock into it. But let me ask you about this, because I'm looking at these polls. There's a range in the polling over the last couple weeks in New Hampshire and it is his back yard. Look at the map, it's Vermont and New Hampshire right next to each other, twin there. Between 6 and 33 points he's got a lead on you up there, and I wonder how much ground you can make in a week, because we only have a week now.\nCLINTON: I feel really good about my campaign in New Hampshire and I remember getting off the plane in New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses last time where I did not win, and I was way behind going into what was then just five days before the primary. And the work that was done on my behalf, the people who came out to support me, the incredible excitement \u2014 I saw that today in Nashua. I got here, it was amazing, Chris. The level of enthusiasm, people who were with me before, people who were with President Obama in '08, everybody working so hard to support me, to get to that primary, to do everything we possibly can. We're not leaving anything on the ground. We're moving forward. And I think we'll do well.\nMATTHEWS: I think everybody should have been impressed. Maybe I wasn't as impressed as I should have been, but everybody should have been, about the way you handled New Hampshire last time around. You came off the loss in Iowa. You went out there and you would stand there \u2014 it was like Bill Clinton staying there until the last dog died. You were out there on that arena, I remember you standing in a, I think it was a field house, and you went on and on and on. It went on for five hours. It was incredible. It was a marathon, answering every single question of everyone in that room. It really was a physical \u2014 a marathon. Are you going to try to match that performance this time, that kind of \"I can do this\" thing?\nCLINTON: I'm going to do everything I can to get out there, to meet with folks here, to answer their questions. I'm really happy we've got a forum on CNN tomorrow night. We've got your MSNBC debate on Thursday night, which will give us a chance to reach a larger audience. But I'm going to be there day after day between now and Tuesday. I respect this primary process. I know how seriously people take it. And I just want them to understand what I'm offering, what I believe we can do. You know, ideas that sound good on paper but can't create results for people are just that, good ideas on paper. I have a track record of producing results. I know how to do all parts of this job. Because we're going to be voting for both a president and a commander in chief. And in New Hampshire, those two sides of this incredibly difficult job are really joined together. And I feel good about the opportunity I'll have to get out, meet with granite staters, make my case, and I'm going to do everything possible to get them to support me next Tuesday.\nMATTHEWS: I know you've been saying nice things about your only opponent now. It's really a battle since Martin O'Malley, Governor O'Malley has withdrawn. It's a two-person race. The only person, and I'm going to say this bluntly \u2014 the only person between a confirmed socialist who's calling for political revolution in this country, winning the nomination of the Democratic party, which has always been more moderate than that, is you. So when you saw that rally last night, the young people all around Senator Sanders, when he yelled revolution out there and they all applauded like mad, do you think that's something that is going to help in a general election, or are we looking at, what we used to call in the 60s, an NDC campaign \u2014 November doesn't count. We just want to win the party, we don't care about the general. You seem to be focused on the general. How do you beat a person who's coming along in the primaries, however, who's saying, I'm going to give you all the things you want, free tuition, more social security benefits without an increase in your taxes, healthcare from birth to death, all government paid. How do you compete with a revolution of promises, really?\nCLINTON: Well first, let me say, I am thrilled, too, that we've got young people getting active in the campaign on the Democratic side. I was very proud of the many, many young people working for me, volunteering for me, voting, caucusing for me in Iowa, and the ones I have here in New Hampshire, I'm just so impressed with. So that's a net good no matter what. I do think that we have an obligation to keep people focused on what's at stake in this election, and you got close to saying it, Chris. We can't let the Republicans rip away the progress we've made. We can't let them go back to trickle-down economics, repeal the affordable care act, we can't let them stack the supreme court for another generation against common sense kind of changes that we need. We've got to get back to the middle, we've got to get back to the big center, we've got to get back to solving problems. That's how we make progress in America. I am proud to be in a line of Democratic presidents who just got in there and fought it out, who got civil rights, who got an economy producing high incomes, who got, finally, the affordable care act, something we've been fighting for since Harry Truman. I know how hard this is and I totally appreciate how exciting it can be to be involved in a campaign that really just puts out these great big ideas. But I want folks to stop and think, no matter what age you are, OK, we agree on getting the economy going. We agree on raising incomes, we agree on combating climate change, we agree on universal coverage. Who has the track record? Who's gotten the results? Who can actually produce the kind of change you want for yourself and your family and for our country? So I'm very energized about this because I like a contest of ideas. That's what politics should be about. We're going to be talking about and arguing about issues on our side, they're going to keep insulting each other on the Republican side, but the goal for any sensible American has to be, do not turn the white house over to the Republicans in November. Do not turn the supreme court further over to their nominees. We can't let that happen.\nMATTHEWS: Well, of course, I think you're offering a lesson in civics and I wonder if we can do that in a couple weeks now. Look, the history of the Democratic party, your party, not Bernie Sanders, he's not a Democratic party member \u2014 your party has produced The New Deal. It produced, the progressive income tax came from the Democrats, from Wilson. Social security, the greatest anti-poverty program ever, came from Roosevelt. And Harry Truman started to fight for health care and civil rights and all these good things that led to the affordable care act. But in every case, you had to battle Republicans who voted against it to the last person. And it's always been a tough fight. You need 60 votes in the senate, you need, what is it, 218 in the house, and if you don't have it, nothing gets done. The Bernie people need to be taught, not him, he won't be taught \u2014 the kids behind him need to be told, this is how it works in our system. You can call for revolution, but it ain't going to happen. There isn't going to be a revolution. There's going to be an election, an inauguration, and then there's going to be a congress sitting with you you've got to do business with, no matter who gets elected. You don't have to worry about logic anymore, just, I'm going to have a revolution and pay for everything.\nCLINTON: Well, where I come out on this is, I don't think our country or the American people can wait. I don't think they can wait for better jobs with rising incomes, getting prescription drug costs down. I think people want to vote for somebody who is going to get in there on the first day, knows how to do the job, is prepared to do the job, and gets to work. And I will give everything I've got to make sure that we preserve the progress we've made, because you're right, it is hard fought. Our system is set up to make it difficult. Checks and balances, separation of powers \u2014 our founders knew that if we were going to survive as a great democracy that they were creating, we had to have a system that kept the passions at bay. We had to have people who were willing to roll up their sleeves and compromise. We couldn't have idealogues who were just hurling their rhetoric back and forth. We had to actually produce results. That hasn't changed since George Washington. We've got to produce results now because a democracy is a fragile organism, Chris. People have to believe they have a stake in it, that their voices count, that their votes count. But then they've got to see results from their investment in our democracy. Our democracy has to work better, our economy has to work better, our politics has to work better. That's what I know how to do and that's what we have to get done in this election.\nMATTHEWS: Madame secretary, unofficially, not on behalf of MSNBC or NBC, congratulations on last night and your much deserved relief and break a leg on Thursday night even if you're the only one in the chair. Thank you for joining us today.\nCLINTON: I'm going to be there.\nMATTHEWS: You said it, I believe you. Thank you.\nCLINTON: I'll be there. Bye-bye.\nMATTHEWS: Thank you.\n","149":"\nBLITZER: The breaking news this hour. It's now official. Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses. She beat Bernie Sanders by a razor-thin margin just 0.2 of a percentage point. Her campaign claimed victory overnight but the Iowa Democratic Party has just issued the final results. They say Hillary Clinton is the winner of the Iowa caucuses. And Secretary Clinton is joining us now from Nashua, New Hampshire. Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us. What's your reaction to the official results now declaring you the winner of the Iowa caucuses?\nCLINTON: I am so thrilled, Wolf. I feel really good and very grateful to the team I had on the ground, to the tens of thousands of Iowans who volunteered, knocked on doors, came out and caucused last night. And I could feel the energy building in the weeks leading up to the caucus. I was out there, making my case about what I want to do and what I think our country must do to get real results with more jobs, rising incomes, build on the Affordable Care Act, deal with climate change, clean energy, defend our rights, all the things I feel passionate about. And I could just watch and, in fact, in that last week I had so many people come up to me and say that they had decided to support me and it could not have been better. It was a great, great night.\nBLITZER: You said last night you breathed a big sigh of relief, your words \u2014 a big sigh of relief. What did you mean by that?\nCLINTON: Well, as you recall, my luck was not that good last time around. And it was wonderful to win the caucus and to have that experience of all the hard work, the grassroots organizing pay off the way it did. Now we're here in New Hampshire and we are going to have a contest of ideas. I'm looking forward to the forum tomorrow night on CNN and then a debate Thursday night, here in New Hampshire, because I think that Democratic voters and other Americans want to know what are the principal differences between me and my friend and opponent, Senator Sanders. And I want to get that information out there. I think it's important people understand that good ideas are one thing but you got to know how to implement. You've got to have a record of getting results. And I'm taking my ideas and my record to the people of New Hampshire this week.\nBLITZER: The Sanders campaign says they won't have this debate Thursday night with you unless you agree to a subsequent debate before the New York primary in New York City. Are you willing to agree to that?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, Wolf, this is really hard to follow because, when we said we would do the debate, they came back with conditions. We met the conditions. Then they said they want different conditions. And we've tried to be very accommodating but, you know, we have agreed with everything that they have asked us to do. And I sure hope \u2014 we're in Bernie Sanders' backyard here in New Hampshire. I sure hope he intends to show up in his neighboring state and let the people of New Hampshire see us both on the debate stage.\nBLITZER: Well, just to press the point, the debate in New York City that they want, are you accepting that?\nCLINTON: No. We've accepted all of their conditions. We did that last week. And they keep trying to add new conditions, which, you know, raises questions about how ready or willing they are to debate here in New Hampshire. We met their conditions. We agreed to more debates, something that I wanted to do because I think it's great to debate and we're ready. I'm going to be there Thursday night.\nBLITZER: All right. Let's move on. The senator's campaign \u2014 they want to do not necessarily a recount but they want to check the voting in Iowa. Is that OK with you?\nCLINTON: You know, look, I \u2014 they \u2014 I can say that I believe the Democratic Party of Iowa ran a good caucus from everything that our people told me. There was an enormous turnout, which everybody said would tremendously favor Senator Sanders. If there are legitimate issues, both sides, I don't think the Democratic Party has any problems with that. But from everything we have learned and know, I won and I'm very proud of that.\nBLITZER: Back in 2008, as you well remember, you lost Iowa but then you came back to win New Hampshire. This time you won Iowa. Can you win New Hampshire one week from today?\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's certainly what I'm aiming for. I care a lot about this state. I view it as being the first-in-the-nation primary for a reason. I know that they tend to favor their neighbors. That's the pattern, the history of the primary. And Senator Sanders is a neighbor. But I think we will have a good contest, talking about what results we can produce, what our records have been, both in domestic policy, foreign policy, national security and I think the people of New Hampshire will get a chance to really evaluate both of us. And I feel good about my prospects.\nBLITZER: You described yourself in your speech last night as a progressive that gets things done. Are you suggesting Bernie Sanders \u2014 he may be a progressive but he can't get things done?\nCLINTON: I'm talking about my record. I'm talking about the Children's Health Insurance Program for 8 million kids. I'm talking about getting health care for National Guard members. I'm talking about helping to push through a treaty to lower nuclear weapons between us and the Russians when I was secretary of state. I'm talking about building the coalition against Iran to bring them to the negotiating table and so many other issues. I have a very long record of getting results for people. That's what I care about. You know, I am all for laying out our ideology, talking about our ideas. I think that's great and it gives you the direction that you want to head. But at the end of the day, what matters to me is that we move our country forward. We actually get more good jobs with rising incomes. We get equal pay for women. We actually begin to move toward early childhood education and paid family leave. And we are ready to really go into the rest of the 21st century with the kind of confidence and optimism that I think our country should be having. So I'm going to lay out my record, lay out my ideas and Senator Sanders can certainly lay out his own and we'll leave it up to the people of New Hampshire to decide what they think is the best choice for them and their families and the results they want to see for themselves in our country.\nBLITZER: As you know, according to the entrance polls in Iowa, Bernie Sanders did a lot better than you did with younger voters, younger men and even younger women. Why do you think is he doing so well with younger voters out there?\nCLINTON: I'm thrilled to see so many young people get into the political process and I was very proud of all the young people who worked for me, volunteered for me, supported me. That's all to the good and it's great for the Democratic Party. But I'm going to have some work to do to reach out to young voters, maybe first-time voters, who have to make a tough decision as they evaluate who should be our president, our commander in chief, and I intend to do that, laying out my case, where we contrast on the issues, what I think can be done to get college to be affordable. I think my plan is going to really help the people who need it most without ballooning costs. I'm going to set forth my plan to refinance student debt, a problem I hear throughout New Hampshire and the country and why I think my plan will help more young people really get started with their lives. The emphasis I want to make on small business, my call that young people join our campaign and then be part of making us the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. And let's defend our rights. I am very proud that I got the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, that I got the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign, that I got the endorsement of The Brady Campaign and Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly and so many others, because they know me and they know what I have done. They know the kind of leader I am. And I want young people to know that as well.\nBLITZER: As you know, Marco Rubio did rather well, coming in at an impressive third place in the Iowa Republican caucuses just behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won Iowa. What do you think about the possibility, if you do get the Democratic nomination, of running against Senator Rubio in a general election?\nCLINTON: You know, Wolf, I'm not thinking that far ahead. My timeframe is next Tuesday and the primary in New Hampshire and then I'll go on to the caucuses in Nevada and the primary at the end of the month in South Carolina and then to the states that lie ahead. I'm going let the Republicans, you know, decide who their nominee will be. I will be prepared to run against and win, no matter who they nominate. I think, as everybody is well aware, I am pretty battle tested. It's important to have gone through this, to know what the Republicans will do. They're already running $6 million of ads against me along with their, you know, Wall Street buddies. And so they know who they don't want to be the Democratic nominee. And I take that as perversely flattering because they also know that I mean what I say and I'll do what I have said, to make sure that they don't ever wreck our economy again. So I'm going take them on as I have over the years and then, when I win, I will certainly reach out, work with them and find common ground wherever we can.\nBLITZER: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us. Congratulations on your win in Iowa.\nCLINTON: Thank you so much, Wolf. Great to talk to you again.\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n","150":"\nWow! What a night. An unbelievable night. What a great campaign. This has been an incredible honor to campaign across Iowa, with so many of you to make the case for the kind of future we want.\nFor the Democratic Party and for the United States of America. There is so much at stake in this election, I don't need to tell you. Every single one of you who came out for me, who worked so many hours \u2014 from my young organizers with energy and passion to the families and friends across this state \u2014 I am deeply grateful.\nI love all of you. Here's what I want you to know. It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now, to have a real contest of ideas. To really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it.\nI am a progressive who gets things done for people. I am honored to stand in the long line of American reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough. That standing still is not an option. And that brings people together to find ways forward that will improve the lives of Americans. I look back over the years of my involvement from the very first job I had at the Children's Defense Fund. And I know. I know what we are capable of doing, I know we can create more good paying jobs and raise incomes for hardworking Americans again. I know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage for every single man, woman, and child.\nI know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I know we can make our education system work for every one of our children, especially those who come with disadvantages. I know we can make college affordable and get student debt off the backs of young people. And I know we can protect our rights, women's rights, gay rights, voting rights, immigrant rights, workers rights. I know too we can stand up to the gun lobby and get common sense gun safety measures.\nAnd how do we do that? We do that by securing the nomination, and then we do it by winning and going into that White House as others before have, determined to push forward on the great goals and values that unite us as Americans.\nI congratulate my esteemed friends and opponents; I wish Governor O'Malley the very best. He is a great public servant who has served Maryland and our country and I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and America. In the last few weeks, we finally began to have what I think is one of the most important substantive conversations that the Democratic party could have. And I am thrilled at all of the people who are playing a part in that.\nI know that we may have differences of opinion about how best to achieve our goals. But I believe we have a very clear idea that the Democratic Party and this campaign stands for what is best in America. And we have to be united. When it is all said and done, we have to be united.\nA Republican vision and candidates that would drive us apart and divide us. That is not who we are, my friends. I follow their candidates very closely, I understand what they're appealing to, and I intend to stand against it. I will not \u2014 I will not let their decisiveness, their efforts to rip away the progress that we've made, be successful. Because we can't afford that. As I stand here tonight, breathing a big sigh of relief, thank you, Iowa. I want you to know, I will keep doing what I have done my entire life.\nI will keep standing up for you. I will keep fighting for you. I will always work to achieve the America that I believe in, where the promise of that dream that we hold out to our children and our grandchildren never fades, but inspires generations to come. Join me, let's go win the nomination. Thank you all and God bless you.\n","151":"\nROBERTS: Well, what do you say we talk to Hillary Clinton, who's good enough to join us this morning on a very important and busy day. Thank you so much for doing that. And so do you have the victory party all set for tonight?\nCLINTON: Well, this is a very tight race, Robin. It's really going down to the wire. But we feel very good, we've worked so hard. I've had a great operation here. So many young people, organizers who fanned out across the state, the thousands of volunteers. We did knock on 125,000 doors this past weekend. So we're very committed, very energized and enthusiastic, but it all depends upon who shows up tonight, who comes out to caucus in Iowa. And I'm urging everyone who is interested in, committed to caucusing for me to please be there tonight, 6:30. I will be there in spirit, because if you stand up for me, I will stand up for you during this campaign and into the White House.\nROBERTS: You know, there are so many similarities between what is going on right now and eight years ago. You again are affected \u2014 unexpected challenge that you are facing. What are the differences and similarities between what you're experiencing now and what happened eight years ago here in Iowa?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that I have a much better organization, to be just really clear about it. I think that we built an organization using a lot of the lessons learned, and we recruited some of the best people that you could find anywhere in the country working in Democratic politics. I think I'm a better candidate. I think that in addition to just knowing more about the caucus process and what we needed to do to build toward this night. My experience as secretary of State really deepened and intensified my understanding about what the next president will have to face. So all in all, I feel like it's a different energized effort that is really bringing in people from across the state and, indeed, across the country who know what's at stake in this election, understand how really dramatic and drastic it would be if the Republicans were to take back the White House because they would rip out the progress. We wouldn't be able to, in my view, get the economy going for everybody, get incomes rising, get affordable college, take care of the rising prescription drug costs, everything I'm talking about, which is really in response to the concerns and the worries that I hear from people as I criss-cross this state.\nROBERTS: All 99 counties you have criss-crossed, and we have seen you and we've seen your husband and we've seen your daughter as well. [laughter]\nCLINTON: Well, I haven't gotten to all 99.\nROBERTS: A third of \u2014\nCLINTON: I had to \u2014 let's just say that. I don't want anybody to think that my silence is affirmation. But I've covered a lot of ground and I sure have met many thousands of people and have really learned so much. You know, that's the best part of this. It's obviously exhausting, it takes a lot of concentration. But what keeps me going are the stories that people tell me. There's something so intimate, at least in my experience because I actually try to listen to people and hear what's on their minds when someone tells you about the open heart surgery that their granddaughter had to have as a baby and how they couldn't have afforded it without the Affordable Care Act, or when a young woman says she's just drowning in student debt and needs a way out, that sticks with me. And I think that the months I've spent here listening to Iowans has really made me a better candidate and I think it will make me a better president.\nROBERTS: Well, speaking of listening to Iowans, we have John Karl. He is out and about, and he is with some voters. And, you know, a third of voters here are undecided, and let's hear what one voter has to ask you. John?\nJONATHAN KARL: Hello, Robin, hello Secretary Clinton. We're with Rob here from Dennison, Iowa. Incredible thing about this. Rob, you were undecided between Hillary Clinton and John Kasich. So you don't even know which party \u2014 what's your question for Secretary Clinton?\nQUESTION: Good morning, Secretary Clinton. My question for you is as a liberal Republican \u2014 it seems to be a dying breed anymore \u2014 I want to know how you're going to work bipartisanly with a very partisan Congress and a \u2014 and a seemingly polarized nation.\nKARL: Good question.\nCLINTON: That's a \u2014 that's a really great question, and thanks for asking it because I get asked that a lot. You know, I have a record of working with Republicans. When I'm actually in a position to do so \u2014 when, you know, there's a campaign, it's a little bit different \u2014 but when I was first lady, I worked to achieve the Children's Health Insurance Program, working across the aisle with both Republicans and Democrats, even reformed our foster care and adoption system, teaming up with Tom DeLay, a very partisan Republican in the House. And when I got to the Senate, I worked hard to get health care for the National Guard and Reserves, I worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in that case. And I \u2014 I don't know that there was a single Republican who didn't co-sponsor one of the bills that I worked on. And as secretary of State, I had similar efforts to reach common ground that proved successful. I know in a campaign that distinctions have to be drawn because we have to give voters a real sense of what each of us wants to do, and to hold us accountable for the agenda we put forth. But I am confident that I'm going to work really hard to find that common ground across the aisle, and we will make progress together.\nROBERTS: Secretary Clinton, thank you very much. We appreciate you joining us on this very busy and important day. Thank you.\nCLINTON: Thanks so much. Great to talk to you.\nROBERTS: You as all \u2014 as always.\n","152":"\n[begin video clip]\nCLINTON: I hope you will fight for me. And I promise you this, I will stand up and fight for you every single day of this campaign. And then when we win I will fight for you in the White House. Thank you and god bless you.\n[end video clip]\nCAMEROTA: A powerful close to Hillary Clinton's last campaign event of the night Sunday. Former secretary of state spent most of the day making her way through Iowa in a last ditch effort to rally caucusgoers ahead of tonight's vote. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton joins us now. Secretary Clinton, good morning.\nCLINTON: Good morning, Alisyn.\nCAMEROTA: Okay. How are you feeling and how do you plan to spend the next 12 hours?\nCLINTON: I am feeling great. I am so proud of the campaign we have run here in Iowa. I've got the most dedicated campaign team, the organizers who have been on the ground, the thousands of volunteers. We actually knocked on 125,000 doors this weekend. So there is just a lot of excitement and energy. I'm urging everybody to come out and caucus tonight to be part of this unique American process. I hope they will come out and caucus for me.\nCAMEROTA: So, Secretary, let's talk about the issue that has bedeviled your campaign. That, of course, is the ongoing investigation into your e-mails. On Friday, the State Department withheld 22 e-mails. They didn't release them. Because of material deemed top secret. I know you have been asked this six ways to Sunday along the campaign trail and I know that you've always said there is nothing there, but your opponents have said that this is big. It's is a big deal. How do you convince voters today not to be concerned about this?\nCLINTON: Well, Alisyn, there is nothing new. And I think the facts are quite helpful here. It's a little bit like what the Republicans and others have tried to do with respect to Benghazi. Just a lot of innuendo, a lot of attacks. I just know that after I testified for 11 hours, answered every question, nothing new came up. Most voters have made up their minds. And I'm grateful for that. The same here. And I think most of the voters who have followed this know exactly what's going on here. I never made any different explanation than the one that I have made over and over again. I take classified information seriously. I did not send or receive any material marked classified and I want all of these released. This is a dispute about retroactive classification, quite a mouthful. So what people talk to me about is how I'm going to get incomes up, how I'm going to make sure the Affordable Care Act works, and get prescription drug costs down, and make college affordable and relieve student debt. That's what's on voters' minds. And that's what I'm talking about and that seems to be what is exciting and energizing people as they move toward the caucus tonight.\nCAMEROTA: Um but Secretary Clinton, something does seem to be happening with this investigation, or at least the FBI seems to be talking about it more, because in the past week several media outlets have said that their sources in the FBI say, quote, \"something's going to happen.\" What does that mean to you?\nCLINTON: It means people are selectively leaking and making comments that have no basis in anything I'm aware of. And, you know, I regret that that seems to be part of the atmosphere because we need to let this inquiry run its course, get it resolved. But I can tell you, Alisyn, that is not on the minds of the literally thousands of people that I have seen in the last few weeks. And I'm glad it isn't. Because the facts are the facts. No matter how much selective leaking or anonymous sourcing and all that kind of stuff that goes on, what people want to know is what I can do to be the best possible president for them and their families. And I've been thrilled at the kind of reaction and response I've been getting, the crowds that we had. That last event last night was just overwhelming. I'm looking forward to people coming out expressing their opinion about who can be the best president and commander in chief for the Democratic Party and then getting on to win the Democratic nomination and being successful next November.\nCAMEROTA: Yesterday \"The New York Times\" endorsed you. They wrote that you are the right choice in terms of experience and vision. I'm sure that was music to your ears. Do you think \"The New York Times\" endorsement plays in Iowa?\nCLINTON: Well, I don't know. But I know \"The Des Moines Register\" does and they endorsed me. I know \"The Boston Globe\" matters and a lot of the newspapers in New Hampshire that have endorsed me and this is very gratifying because, yeah, there is a lot of static that goes on and the Republicans and their allies are determined to do everything they can to try to bring me down. They don't know me very well. Because I don't quit when I'm fighting for what I believe in. And I believe that I can be the president who makes progress with people. And I'm just going to stick with it. And so when very respectable and responsible outlets like \"The Register\" or \"The Times\" or \"The Boston Globe\" and others look at all the candidates, interview us, ask us really hard questions and conclude that I'm their choice for president, I find that incredibly validating. And I do hope that voters pay attention to it because it's a pretty tough vetting process they go through.\nCAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, that's talk about the Republicans and what's going on in terms of how the electorate feels. I know that you know that this campaign has been about how angry and how anxious people are feeling out there and of course all of the division in this country. Some people say we have never seen anything like it. You've made a point during the campaign of talking about how you don't really like how the Republicans do become in many ways. So how would you bring the country together, including Republicans?\nCLINTON: Well, the same way I always have. When I'm not actually running for office, I work closely with everybody, including Republicans, to find common ground. That's what I did when I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures 8 million kids. I worked with Democrats and Republicans. It's what I did when I got to the Senate and, you know, worked with Republicans to get health care for our National Guard and Reserve members when they weren't being deployed. I worked on responding to 9\/11. I found common ground on a number of issues with respect to health care and the like. As secretary of state, the same thing. So, Alisyn, I think that you've got to work at it every single day. There is no shortcut. You have to build the relationships and you have to be willing to try to meet people where they are and move them over. That's the way politics works in America. That's the way our system is set up to work. Now we can get frustrated by it. We can wish that it were smoother. But I'm very proud of the record that President Obama has compiled. You know, the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank regulations on Wall Street, getting our economy out of the ditch. The Republicans put it into working to put those sanctions on Iran, the effort I led. And so much more. So I know how you get things done. I am a progressive who wants to make progress and actually produce real results in people's lives. That's what I'm offering. I'm not overpromising. I'm laying out the plans that I have. I'm asking people to look at them and I'm asking people to hold me accountable. Because I want to get back to working together to try to unite this country to make it possible for us to set big goals and achieve them. That's what I intend to do.\nCAMEROTA: Let's talk about how this differs for you than 2008. Once again, you find yourself here in Iowa with an opponent who some think sort of came out of nowhere but who has garnered a lot of excitement. So why isn't this deja vu all over again for you today?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I always thought we'd have a close contest and I think that is good. It's good for the Democratic Party. But I'm thrilled at my campaign and we learned a lot of lessons. We have applied those lessons. We have got a great team working literally around the clock. I think I'm a better candidate. I think my experience as secretary of state gave me a depth and understanding about what the next president will face that, frankly, nobody else running on either side could have. And I think that what voters are looking for is a way out of their frustration. Yeah, people are angry. People are disappointed. People are worried. You know, what happened in the Great Recession was a body blow. I mean, 9 million people lost their jobs and 5 million houses were lost and $13 trillion and family wealth was wiped out. People haven't gotten a raise. They have been working but they don't feel like they are getting ahead. So they deserve \u2014 the American people deserve to be worried. But what I'm offering is a way forward. You know, once you get through the anger and the political attacks and all the rest of it, people have to ask themselves, who can do the most for me and my family? Who can protect our country? Who can get the economy going and incomes rising and make sure the Affordable Care Act works and get prescription drug costs down? I know how to do this and I'm ready. I'm experienced and I think I have got the best shot at becoming both the nominee and the next president.\nCAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, we will be watching, of course, with great interest what unfolds over the next 12 hours. Thanks so much for taking time to be on NEW DAY.\nCLINTON: Thank you. Hope you feel better. Take care.\nCAMEROTA: Thank you. Thank you. That's so nice. I'm drinking tea and honey right now. Thanks so much.\n","153":"\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you for joining us, Madam Secretary.\n[crosstalk]\nLet's talk about that \"Des Moines Register\" \u2014 that \"Des Moines Register\" poll that has you in the lead \u2014 eight years ago, your hopes were dashed by that surge of new voters for Barack Obama. Are you confident that won't happen again?\nCLINTON: Well, George, here's what I'm confident about. We've run a terrific campaign from the grassroots up. I feel so proud and grateful to the thousands of Iowans who have joined this campaign. And we're going to keep working as hard as I can and everybody else, until the caucuses conclude tomorrow night. Of course, it's close. It's competitive. That's why I hope everybody who has decided to caucus for me will be sure to come out on Monday night.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You did have that surprise on Friday; the State Department saying they will not release 22 emails of yours deemed top secret. You want them released. Why are you so confident that release would not compromise national security? What do you know about those emails that we don't?\nCLINTON: Well, here's what I know. I know that this is, I think, a continuation of the story that has been playing out for months. There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, who's had a chance to review them, has said that this email chain did not originate with me and that there were no classification markings. So I do want them released and of course I can't be clear about exactly what the reasons might be for some in the government, as part of this interagency dispute, to make this request not to make them public. But I would like to see them disclosed and I think they can. It should be disclosed \u2014\n[crosstalk]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Your supporters \u2014\nCLINTON: \u2014 that I'm told about them.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: \u2014 your supporters including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa, and Senator Feinstein herself, has suggested it's political. Is that what you think?\nCLINTON: Well, it's \u2014 I'm going to leave that to others who are quite experienced in the ways of Washington to comment on. I just have to point out that the timing and some of the leaks that have led up to it are concerning. And I just want this matter resolved. The best way to resolve is to do what I asked months ago, release these, let the public see them and let's move on.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you've said many times that the emails were not marked classified. No evidence that that's not true. But the non-disclosure agreement you signed as secretary of state said that that really is not that relevant. It says classified information is marked or unmarked classified and that all of your training to treat all of that sensitively and should know the difference.\nCLINTON: Well, of course. And that's exactly what I did. I take classified information very seriously. You know, you can't get information off the classified system in the State Department to put onto an unclassified system, no matter what that system is. We were very specific about that and you \u2014 when you receive information, of course, there has to be some markings, some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case. The final thing I would say because clearly the best answer to all of this is release and disclose these materials is that what I'm told is that this chain of emails very well included a published newspaper report. That seems a little hard to understand, that we would be retroactively over classifying a public newspaper article. So let's just get it out. Let's see what it is and let the American people draw their own conclusions. This is very much like Benghazi, George. You know, the Republicans are going to continue to use it, beat up on me. I understand that. That's the way they are. But after 11 hours of testimony, answering every single question, in public, which I have requested for many months, I think it's pretty clear they're grasping at straws and this will turn out \u2014\n[crosstalk]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally on this matter, you know, a few months back, you told my colleague, David Mir it was a mistake to set up this private server. Yet just this Monday, you said there was no error in judgment. How do you square those two statements?\nCLINTON: Well, look, as I've said many times, it was permitted. My predecessors had engaged in a similar practice. It was not the best choice. I wouldn't be here talking to you about it. I'd be talking about what people in Iowa are talking to me about, about affordable health care and jobs and rising wages and all of the concerns that are on their minds. And be, you know, really able to answer their questions as I have been now for so many months.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You and Senator Sanders really going at it right now. And here was \u2014 he was on the stump there yesterday, saying this about your attack.\n[begin video clip]\nSANDERS: Don't tell me that I'm defending or protecting the gun lobby. Don't tell me I'm attacking Planned Parenthood. Those are inaccuracies. And we can do better than that.\n[end video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He's calling you on this, says he got a D- rating from the NRA and 100 percent record with Planned Parenthood.\nCLINTON: Well, let me tell you what the people who work on these issues every day have said. They say I'm the leader. I'm the leader who has taken on tough issues. I've taken on difficult issues like Planned Parenthood, the gun lobby, for many years. And they concluded to endorse me by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. I was very honored to have that. That's not saying that others haven't voted with them. But they were looking for a leader and they found it with me. I've been endorsed by The Brady Campaign and yesterday in a very emotional event in Ames, Iowa, endorsed by Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, because they believe I'm the leader that they want to stand up to the gun lobby, the same with the Human Rights Campaign. They concluded I was the leader to protect and advance the cause of the rights of the LGBT community. Now that is just the facts. People who have known us, people who have evaluated us, people who have concluded what they want in the next president have sided with me. And I'm very proud of that.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you just mentioned [inaudible] hitting you with the email issue. They're clearly going to hit Bernie Sanders with the fact that he's a Democratic socialist if he gets the nomination. Some of your supporters concerned about that, Senator Claire McCaskill, are saying they can't wait to run an ad with a hammer and a sickle. Steny Hoyer, Congressman Steny Hoyer, saying he calls himself a socialist. I don't think that's a good title to be running for President of the United States. Is that what you think? Will the fact that he's a Democratic socialist make it harder for Democrats to win in November?\nCLINTON: Well, that certainly is what a lot of Democratic leaders are saying. And I take them at their word. They know their states. They know the country. They know we have to take back the Senate. They want to make some advances in the House as well as at governor and legislature levels across the country. Here's what I think. I think I've been subjected, as you know so well, to years of scrutiny and I'm still standing, talking to you in the lead here in Iowa for the caucuses and going on after that. And it's a very tough gantlet to run. And if there are issues, that Republicans and their allies on the Right believe they could use to bring down a Democratic, they're going to use it. I feel vetted. I feel ready. I feel strong and I think I'm the best person to be the nominee and to defeat whoever they nominate in November.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, I wonder what your response to this quote from your old friend, Robert Rice, Secretary of Labor under President Clinton. He said you're the most qualified candidate for the political system we now have. But Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have. How do you respond to that?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I'm a progressive who thinks it's important to actually make progress. That's what I've done my entire life. That's what I will do as president. Obviously I have big goals. I want to get to universal coverage; I want to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. Get incomes rising, get women equal pay, raise the minimum wage, have a renaissance in manufacturing, move toward clean, renewable energy \u2014 I have big goals. And I tell you how I'm going to get there and how I'm going to pay for them. And I think that is what the Americans want. I'm not going to sit here and overpromise and under-deliver. I'm going to tell you what I know we can achieve, and that's going to take the political system we have right now, and then I intend to bring in more people, as always have, George. When I ran for Senate the first time, you remember, you know, people didn't give me much of a chance. I won and then when I was reelected, I won with a bigger percentage. And then when I was Secretary of State, even the Republicans said I was doing a good job. So I understand politics. I understand a campaign. I am focused on my mission to make sure this country works for everybody, particularly hardworking middle-class families who rightly feel they've been left out and left behind. I think I know how to do that, and I think the voters know that I know how to do that.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Secretary Clinton, thanks for joining us this morning.\nCLINTON: Great to talk to you, George. Thank you.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And we will be right back with Bernie Sanders.\n","154":"\nMATTHEWS: You know, we're getting near closing time and closing arguments in the big fight in Iowa, and then in New Hampshire coming on quickly. Donald Trump is not going to debate on Fox tomorrow night. Will you debate on our debate? Will you show up?\nCLINTON [via telephone]: Look, Chris, what I've said through my campaign is that I would look forward to another debate. I am, you know, anxious, if we can get something set up, to be able to be there. And so let's try to make it happen.\nMATTHEWS: Well, someone has to lead from the front. Will you be there, no matter what? Will you show up and wait and see? Will you be there waiting for Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley? Would you, in other words, lead the pack in showing up and committing to doing that?\nCLINTON: Look, I'm ready for the debate, and I hope Senator Sanders will change his mind and join us. And I think the DNC and the campaign should be able to work this out. I've said for \u2014 you know, for a long time that I'd be happy to have more debates, and I hope we can get this done.\nMATTHEWS: Well, if he doesn't show up, will you?\nCLINTON: Well, let's hope that we can get it worked out. I don't want to \u2014 you know, I don't want to jump the gun and create more problems for everybody trying to get this worked out, so we can all come to agreement that the voters of New Hampshire and America deserve to see us, you know, debating before the New Hampshire primary.\nMATTHEWS: So you won't be there \u2014 just a last question on this. You won't be there unless Bernie's there.\nCLINTON: Well, I'm not committing to that, either, Chris. I think we should have another debate. I think people want it. They have called for it. Folks have moved forward trying to get it set up. We've got, you know \u2014 look, 24 hours in a political campaign is an eternity.\nMATTHEWS: Right.\nCLINTON: We've got a little time to try to get everybody on board, which would certainly be my preference.\nMATTHEWS: OK, you believe candidates should have the courage to face each other before the \u2014 before the caucuses, in other words. You think you should be there and he should be there.\nCLINTON: I do. I think that \u2014 you know, I agreed, we all agreed to go with the process that the DNC had set up. And you know, I've been saying for a while that if they come up with more debates, I will be there. And now we've got a real, live possibility, and I \u2014 I personally think it would be great for the \u2014 you know, the primary. We're moving into the caucus, as you know so well, on Monday.\nMATTHEWS: OK...\nCLINTON: And then once we come out of there, whatever happens, we should agree to debate in New Hampshire.\nMATTHEWS: In other words, you're sticking to your commitment, I will be there.\nCLINTON: I will \u2014 I will debate. Now, as I say, I'd want \u2014 I want all the campaigns and the DNC to agree. That is my preference.\nMATTHEWS: OK.\nCLINTON: That's what we've tried to, you know, do in our side of the ledger here.\nMATTHEWS: OK.\nCLINTON: And I'm pushing people to come to agreement so we can all get out there and debate before the New Hampshire primary.\nMATTHEWS: Well, this is getting very sharply worded as we get closer to the caucuses. The word in \"The New York Times\" this morning, Madam Secretary, is that Senator Sanders is readying an attack ad against you. We don't know whether he's going to use it, but the language is basically that you're in hock to Wall Street because of the speaking fees you've taken from Goldman Sachs. How do you respond or how will you respond to an eleventh-hour attack like that?\nCLINTON: Well, first, it's really disappointing, Chris. You know, Senator Sanders has started to get increasingly personal with his attacks. He even compared me to Dick Cheney last week, which, you know, is kind of a low blow. So it would be another escalation and a breaking of his pledge not to go negative. One of the things that I think has been great about the Democratic side is we really have focused on issues, while the Republicans have been hurling insults. And I think the people in Iowa want to go to the caucuses thinking about which one of us as president can actually make a difference in their lives, and that's the case I've been focused on making. So you know, it would be a sharp departure by Senator Sanders. And you know, the other part of this, is anybody who knows me knows you can't buy me. I mean, honestly, I've been standing up and fighting and getting knocked around for years, trying to get things done that I think would improve people's lives. And I'm not going to stop, and that includes anybody trying to, you know, mess with our financial system.\nMATTHEWS: Well, when he uses phrases like \u2014 dark phrases like, You can draw your own conclusions, as to whether you're in hock to Goldman Sachs or anyone \u2014 is that \u2014 is that a low blow, You can draw your own conclusions?\nCLINTON: Well, I think he's trying to go to the line without going over it. And you know, clearly, some of the journalists covering us are starting to notice and call him out on it. But I feel very \u2014 you know, very positive and energized by what I'm seeing happening here in Iowa. And I know that I have the best plan to rein in Wall Street abuses, to make sure it doesn't ever happen again. Lots of folks, from Barney Frank to Paul Krugman, have said that's the case because I don't just go after the big banks. You know, we already have the authority to do that under Dodd-Frank, and I have said I would use that authority if they were posing a systemic risk to our economy. But equally importantly, we've got to go after the shadow banking sector. You know, let's not forget Lehman Brothers, AIG, Countrywide, Rapovia. And let's also remind people, Chris, that, clearly, the billionaires, as Bernie likes to say \u2014 the billionaires have chosen sides. They're running ads against me and trying to, you know, kind of hoodwink Democrats into voting against me because they know exactly what I will do because they've seen me in action. So whether it's, you know, Karl Rove or the hedge fund guys with their own super-PAC, or Joe Ricketts jumping in now with a kind of ham-handed effort to look like he was, you know, going against Bernie, when the real point was to, you know, stir opposition to me. I take that as perversely flattering and as the single best refutation of what Senator Sanders is trying to imply.\nMATTHEWS: Well, you're giving us a real rogue's gallery here of Dick Cheney and Karl Rove. [laughter]\nAnyway, let me ask you about the slogans. You used a phrase the other day, these shouting slogans. Now, I know what you mean \u2014 I'm going to build a wall across the Rio Grande \u2014 across \u2014 along the Rio Grande River. I'm going to make the Mexicans pay for it. But on the Democratic side, Senator Sanders says things like free health care, or rather, government-paid health care for life, as a right. He talks about free tuition when you go to a great school like Berkeley or Madison, Wisconsin. Free! Free! Is that what you mean, this \u2014 we had a young guy on yesterday from South Carolina who switched from you to Senator Sanders, and he \u2014 I went through this list of free things and I said, Where's the money come from? And he says, Well, we put a man on the moon. We can do this. And that kind of fantastic \u2014 what do you call it \u2014 appeal. And then I heard from Sanders the other day that they're going to stay left, right to the general, they're not going to make any appeal to the middle. How do you beat somebody who promises to go hard left, right to November, and offers all this stuff to people who are 20 years old, 22 years old, and they don't have to pay much taxes now, but you say, Look, you're going to get free \u2014 no more tuition bills, no more bills! You're going to have no health care the rest of your life, so forget having to buy insurance. It's a pretty good offer. Is that what you mean by shouting slogans?\nCLINTON: Well, I was really more referring to the Republicans, as you pointed out initially. And I have been, you know, pointing out the differences in the approach between myself and Senator Sanders because I know that it's more important we actually make progress than fall back into gridlock. And let's take health care as an example. You know, we've been trying, as Democrats, since Harry Truman to get on the path to universal coverage. Before it was called \"Obama care,\" it was called \"Hillary care,\" and I have the scars to prove it. And I was thrilled when President Obama passed and signed the Affordable Care Act. We are now at 90 percent coverage. I sure think we ought to improve it. I've got plans to get the costs down and make sure we do go after high prescription drug costs and some of the other drivers of health care costs. But I think it's a lot smarter to try to go from 90 percent to 100 percent than to throw our country into another contentious debate about health care. Where's the money going to come from? Who's going to be paying it? If you have health care you like, if you're under a private plan, do you have to give it up? If you're on Medicare and you work, do you have to pay more taxes? All these questions that would be thrown back into the public arena and we'd have to start all over again from 0 to 100 percent. I just think we want to stay on the path of making progress. Now, some people, you know, say, Oh my gosh, that's so pragmatic. It's not, you know, soaring, or whatever they say. Well, I'm out there talking to people who prescription drug costs have gone up from $200 to $14,000. I'm talking to people whose insulin cost has gone up three times. That's not a new drug. That doesn't have any new research in it. I'm talking to people who are thanking me for the Affordable Care Act because the lifetime limit, the cap has been lifted. And a man yesterday in Davenport said to me, I'm so grateful because I've got a granddaughter with a congenital heart condition. These people can't wait, Chris. We can't wait for another big debate that promises, you know, the sky when we know we've got to deliver on the ground. We've got to help people deal with the problems, the issues, the challenges they're facing right now. We have to restore faith that our government can work. And that is what I intend to do as president, and I'm going to keep fighting for that. And I respect the goal because Senator Sanders and I share the same goal. We want to get to universal coverage. I think my way will get us there faster and provide the health care that the people here in Iowa are telling me they are desperately, desperately in need of.\nMATTHEWS: Last question, and it's so important to this campaign. I think so. I know you think so. It has to do with history. And it's not the only issue in the campaign, obviously, but if you look at the American Constitution \u2014 and you've studied constitutional law \u2014 and the fact is that it wasn't until after the civil war that African-American men were given the right to vote in the 15th Amendment. And then women didn't get it until after the First World War. There's a long lag there. Obama was elected president. You might get elected president. You may well get elected president. Do you think it's \u2014 you think young American women \u2014 say, young women in college, 18 to 22, 23 \u2014 do they get it, how long this struggle has been and the fact that it's a precarious struggle that could fall back? Do they know that all the rights to choice, to equality at workplace, where they do get it, all were fought for? Do they get it? That's my simple question. I don't know if they do. Do you think they get it?\nCLINTON: Look, I think that a lot of young people \u2014 and I wouldn't limit it to women. I think young people of every background, every racial, ethnic, religious background, are, you know, trying to understand how best they can participate in our political system and what the stakes are for them. And of course, you know, if you haven't been through a lot of these struggles, it's easy either not to know about them or to think they didn't go far enough or that, you know, everything is taken care of. So we've got the two extremes of the argument. But here's what I'm hearing, at least from the young women who come to see me. They say, Hey, OK, you're for equal pay. What are you going to make sure I get it? I had a young woman the other day here in Iowa say, I want to go to law school. How can I be sure that if I work hard and do well and get a job, I'm going to get equal pay? And I said, OK, that's the right question because we've been fighting for this. We've made progress, but not near enough. Here's exactly what I think we need to do to get it. Or young women who say, you know, I can't balance family and work. I had a young woman come to see me holding her 9-month-old baby and she said, you know, I can't go back to work until I get my baby stabilized. I need paid family leave. What are you going to do about it? So I think what's happening is, as the campaign goes on, a lot of young people \u2014 and let's focus on young women \u2014 are moving from the sort of general, either we haven't gone far enough or those fights are over and I don't have to worry about it, to being much more specific. And that is a good development because at the end of our efforts here in the primaries, and if I'm so fortunate enough to get the nomination, then I think we fight out an election between a party that believes we've got to continue to address the lacks in our drive for equality, our drive for justice, whether it's racism, sexism, homophobia, you name it \u2014 we need to address those gaps, and the other side doesn't even want to admit they exist. So I think we're going to have a very positive reaction in the general election between, you know, the big deniers on the Republican side, and you know, Let's make progress, get things done, on my side.\nMATTHEWS: Thank you so much. One last \u2014 just to clarify what you said about the debate. Would you like the chairman \u2014 the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to approve the MSNBC\/NBC debate next week?\nCLINTON: I would like the chairmen of the party and the campaigns to agree that we can debate in New Hampshire next week.\nMATTHEWS: OK.\nCLINTON: That is what I'm hoping will happen.\nMATTHEWS: OK. Thank you so much. It's been an honor to have you on, Secretary Hillary Clinton from Iowa. Thanks for joining us on HARDBALL tonight.\nCLINTON: Thanks, Chris. Good to talk to you again.\n","155":"\nCLINTON: Oh, thank you all so much. Thank you. Oh, you are great. Thank you.\nOh, my goodness. I'll tell you, it was worth it, trying to get here. You have been so generous with your time. And I'm just so grateful to be back in Marshalltown and to have this chance to talk with you, now less than a week until the caucus on Monday night. But it's just really meaningful to me that you would be here and be part of this process, and I really am grateful to each and every one of you.\nI've learned a lot in the last months, and I really think that spending all this time in small groups and big ones is going to make me a better president. So I thank you for everything you've done to make that possible. [applause]\nAnd I really want to thank Mark Smith for his endorsement. I'm thrilled. Thank you so very much, Representative. And I have a\u2014I have a plan that I hope will come to pass when it\u2014that affects Mark. And that is I hope that we will be able to make him the majority leader of the House of Representatives in the state legislature. [applause]\nThink of all the good things that he could do for you and for people across Iowa.\nWell, it's getting close. And when all of you decide to go caucus on Monday, you're going to be the first people in the world to get to express an opinion about who should be the next president and commander in chief for our country.\nAnd I know how seriously Iowans take this because I've been talking with you and listening to you. But I want to just spend a few minutes really discussing what's at stake, because this is one of the most consequential elections that we've had in quite some time.\nWhen you think about it, there are some very big differences between us and the Republicans, and that puts a special responsibility on you and voters to try to decide where you stand. Well, I will tell you where I stand.\nI believe that the Republican policies that are being promoted by this crop of candidates that are traveling across our state and country would set our country back, rip up the progress we've made, and undermine our future. And that is true across the board, but let me just pick a few of the most important issues. Let's take the economy.\nYou heard from them, they are spouting the same failed economic policies: trickle-down economics; cut taxes on the wealthy; get out of the way of corporations. We have tried that, it does not work. And it's important to know the facts. And the facts are that our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House who cares about creating jobs and raising incomes for Americans. [applause]\nAnd the last two Democratic presidents we've had, both of whom I know, which I kind of am proud of, they each inherited economic problems from their Republican predecessors.\nYou know, in my husband's case, it was a recession, a huge national debt that had been quadrupled in the prior 12 years and a big deficit. So when he got to Washington, people said, \"OK. So, what do you especially bring to Washington that can make a difference?\" He said, \"Well, I guess I bring arithmetic. We're going to make it add up again for the American people.\" And at the end of eight years, we did.\nTwenty-three million new jobs, but most importantly, incomes went up for everybody. Not just those at the top, hard-working middle-class families, working families, poor families. More people were lifted out of poverty than in any recent time in our history. And we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus. We were on the right track.\nWell, back came the Republicans and back came trickle-down economics. George W. Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and got out of the way of corporations to the extent that the man he put in charge of keeping an eye on Wall Street took a chainsaw to a big stack of regulations and had a great big smile on his face.\nNow we know what happened, don't we? We went into the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, and when Barack Obama became president, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that big ditch that the Republicans put us in during their administration. [applause]\nAnd it was not easy. I know; I talked to him about it. When he asked me to be secretary of State, he said, \"We got to focus on the economy here at home and we got to fix all the problems that we also inherited around the world.\"\nAnd what did he do? Well, we're back on track with 14 million new jobs. The Affordable Care Act was passed. We're now at 90 percent health care coverage in America for the first time. [applause]\nHe passed and signed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s, the Dodd-Frank law; saved the auto industry, which was on the brink of collapse which would have taken another, you know, couple of million jobs down with them. We ended up losing 9 million because of that Great Recession, 5 million homes were lost and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.\nNow, if you want to go back there, you got a lot of folks, including one who was here today, who are spouting that same stuff, because that's where we'll end up again. In fact, you are four times more likely to see a recession in America when you have a Republican in the White House.\nSo the economy is going to be at the core of this election. So you should ask everybody who's running what they're going to do about it. And I got to tell you, I'm proud of what we've been doing on the Democratic side. We have our differences, but we have differences over issues, and that's what we talk about, not insults, which is what happens among the Republicans.\nSo I've put out a plan. Here is what I think we need to do. We need more infrastructure jobs. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our rail systems, our sewer systems, our water systems. We have work to do in our country, and those are jobs that can't be exported, they need to be done right here and put Americans back to work building our economy, making us more competitive.\nAnd then we're going to take the tax system and get rid of the incentives that actually encourage people to take jobs and move them overseas, take factories and build them overseas. We're going to reverse that so we start investing in America again, advance manufacturing. I know it can be done because I've been to some of your community colleges. I have seen the work that is happening there, the training that is going on.\nI also know it can be done because while we are going to combat climate change, we're going to create more clean, renewable energy jobs. And that will be a huge economic opportunity\u2014[applause]\u2014that is directly linked to what Iowa has been doing.\nYou know, the Republicans, when you ask them about climate change, they all say the same thing. \"Well, I don't know, I'm not a scientist.\" You know, there's an easy way to remedy that. Go talk to a scientist, listen to a scientist, learn about what's going on. And, you know, that's bad enough that they're into denial. What really is troubling is they're missing this huge economic opportunity.\nAnd when I tell people that, I see, you know, sometimes folks around the country have a little bit of skepticism on their faces, and here's what I tell them. I know we can create those jobs because look at what Iowa has done.\nAnd I want you to thank Representative Smith. Thank you. And it started with Tom Vilsack and the Democrats making a commitment. Iowa now gets one-third of your electricity from renewable sources, mostly wind.\nYou have 7,000 people already working in the wind industry in this state. You are doing research on advanced biofuels that the Defense Department thinks may be able to fuel Navy vessels and Air Force planes. So Iowa is in the forefront of the energy revolution because some country is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower. It's either going to be China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and we need to make up our minds that it is going to be us and we're going to be doing the technology, the innovation and exporting to the rest of the world. [applause]\nWe also need to be focusing on small business because that's where most of the jobs come from in America. And I want to be the small business president. My dad was a small businessman, so I want to clear away all the underbrush so people can start businesses again. And especially young people. S lot of young people tell me they'd love to go into business, but they can't get credit. Part of it is they have such student debts they can't get credit; we've got to fix that. So we need to make it easier to start and grow a small business.\nNow, there are two ways we can raise incomes real quick. One, we've got to raise the minimum wage. People who work full time should not still be in poverty. [applause]\nThere should be a ladder of opportunity. And the other way is to guarantee equal pay for women's work, and that will raise incomes and families will be better off, the economy will be. [applause]\nNow, everything I've just said to you the Republicans don't agree with it, every bit of it. They don't believe in any of it. They don't really tell you what they will do except just, you know, get out of the way and let corporations do whatever they want and let their, you know, big donors do whatever they want. Well, that's not going to work. We know it won't, and we can't be sold that bill of goods again.\nThe other thing we have to do is to change the tax system so that it is fairer. And I'm am the only candidate running on either side who has made this pledge. I will raise your incomes, I will not raise middle-class taxes. I do not think it is right\u2014[applause]\u2014to be going to people who suffered because of the Republican recession and asking for you to help us make the investments for the future. I want you to take advantage of them, but I want to go where the money is, and the money is at the top, and that's where we need to be shifting our tax system. So we need to close the loopholes and the special gimmicks that corporations and the wealthy use, like this thing called the \"carried interest loophole\" that I've been against for years.\nWe also need to do what Warren Buffett suggested. I was really very happy that he endorsed me, and I went to Omaha with him. And we were standing there and he\u2014[applause]\u2014he said, you know, I'm not too popular among my rich friends these days because I think people like me should pay more money into our tax system to support our country. And he has something he calls the Buffett rule. Anybody who makes $1 million should have to pay a 30 percent effective tax rate. So I've adopted the Buffett rule and we're going to go right at it and try to get that done. [applause]\nAnd then I want to go further, I want to impose what I call a fair share surcharge on incomes of $5 million or more. Now, there aren't very many of those, but there's a lot of money there because I want to use that money to make college affordable. I want to use that money to invest in clean energy. I want to use that money to move toward paid family leave so that families get more support to be able to do their work at home and take care of their families. I want to use that money to help bring down the cost of child care, which in some states is as expensive as college tuition. There are things we can do that will relieve the burdens on middle-class families, and the money should come from those who have it.\nNow, people say to me, \"Well, how are we ever going to get that done?\" Well, I do have a political strategy. I've seen a little bit of this in the last 20-plus years. There are not that many people who make $5 million or more in America, and I think we can make a very clear case.\nMr. Congressman over there, are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? Are you in favor of early childhood education and the way we're going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million? Or are you going to deny that to the 350,000 people who live in your district?\nWe're going to make a very tough case about why we have to make the tax code fairer. You know, you can talk about it, but I have a plan to do it. Not just a plan on the substance, but a political plan because I want you to know what I aim to do for you and what it will cost you. And I want everybody to be able to look at that and make your own judgment.\nI also have what has been described as the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street.\nNow, I totally agree with my two esteemed opponents, Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley, that we've got to keep our eyes on the big banks. And no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail. But we already have the authority to go after them. That was in the Dodd-Frank bill. We don't have to do that, we just have to implement it. And I have said if they pose a systemic risk to our economy, I will go after them and I will use the process President Obama signed into law.\nBut here's where I differ with my two friends\u2014that is not enough. And this is what we've been arguing about on the debate stage. You see it wasn't just the big banks that caused our problems, it was an investment bank like Lehman Brothers. It was a big insurance conglomerate called AIG. It was a mortgage company called Countrywide. It was another bank, not one of the big five, called Wachovia, and others who are in what is called the shadow banking sector.\nSo what I've is we're going after risk wherever it is in the financial system. And Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, said I have the best plan. Barney Frank, who is actually the Frank in Dodd-Frank, said I have the best plan because I'm trying to look not just at what happened in the past to prevent that from happening again, but what could happen in the future.\nAnd you know, the best evidence I have that I have the best plan is that the Republicans and their billionaire allies are running ads against me. You know, it started a few weeks ago. These two hedge fund billionaires formed a super PAC to run ads against me to convince Democrats not to support me. And then along came Karl Rove, you know, the errand boy for the billionaires, and he's now running an ad against me. And now another billionaire has jumped in, and he's now running an ad against me.\nNow you got to stop to think, why are they spending all this money to try to convince Democrats not to support me? Well, I think you know the answer, because they know that I say what I mean, I do what I say I will do, and I know how to get it done, to take after them, to prevent them from\u2014[applause]\u2014pushing an agenda on us that hurts the economy.\nNow, another area where I have very strong feelings and share exactly the same goal as Senator Sanders is health care. You know, I believe in universal health care coverage. Every American should have it. You know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare back in '93 and '94 when I was trying to get universal health care, and we were not successful. And that was really disappointing.\nI mean, the drug companies, the insurance companies spent millions of dollars against us. So we didn't succeed. And then I got to thinking, well, what can I do now? Because, you know, my view is when you're knocked down, you share the human experience because everybody gets knocked down about something. The real question is whether you get back up. So I started thinking, what can I do that can help somebody make a difference in their lives.\nAnd I remembered when I was traveling around the country trying to get universal health care, meeting so many people who did not have health insurance, they couldn't afford it, they had a pre-existing condition and the insurance companies wouldn't give it to them. And I met so many really good, decent people who are so overwhelmed by what was happening to them. And I remember I was at the Children's Hospital in Cleveland. I was meeting with a group of parents whose kids were really sick with chronic diseases. And one man said to me, he said, \"You know, I've gone everywhere to try to get insurance for my daughters. I have two girls with cystic fibrosis, and nobody will sell it to me.\"\nI said what do they say when you go ask them and you tell them you want to try to pay for something? They say no. He said, I'll tell you what the last person told me at the insurance company I visited. He said, we don't insure burning houses. This man said, they called my little girls burning houses. And that stuck with me, that and the stories I heard. So I started to work with Democrats and Republicans and we created the Children's Health Insurance Program, and it now insures eight million kids because when you get\u2014[applause]\u2014you encounter an obstacle, you run into a problem, you've got to keep going. You can't ever stop if you're trying to accomplish something that will help other people. And I was thrilled when the president passed and signed the Affordable Care Act.\nWe've been trying to get that\u2014the Democratic party has been trying to get that accomplished since Harry Truman. And now, I meet people all the time who are benefiting from it. I want to build on it and I want to improve it. You know, the Republicans want to repeal it, and that's what they'll do if they get the White House back. We can't let that happen.\nHere is what I want to do. I want to decrease costs, out-of-pocket costs; decrease prescription drug costs. [applause]\nI want to make sure that we get the authority for Medicare to negotiate for lower drug costs with the drug companies. I want to go after the predatory pricing that drug companies are using to raise the price of drugs. I want to take away their tax benefits. They actually get a tax benefit for advertising all that stuff on TV to us that we never\u2014I can't understand what they're talking about.\nThey have people walking through fields of wildflowers, walking on beaches. They have the name of the drug which, you know, is unpronounceable. And then in a low voice, under the music, they have somebody saying if you take this drug, you know, your nose will fall off. I mean, it\u2014[laughter]\u2014drives you crazy. And they spend more money advertising on TV than they spend on research. So we're going to go right at them. We're going to take them on on this.\nBut I don't want to start over, my friends. That's the disagreement I have with Senator Sanders. I want us to build on what we have and make it better, and go from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent of Americans. I don't want to start at zero and have to\u2014[applause]\u2014fight it all over again, have to have the national battle we that we had on health care over the last 25 years. So I'm determined that we're going to make this work for everybody, and I know it's the right thing to do. And I hope that, you know, we will be able to get your costs down, your co-pays, your deductibles, what, you know, a lot of people are telling me are starting to pinch again.\nI also will defend Social Security against privatization. The Republicans still want to privatize it. They're still talking about that. It's a terrible idea. And you know the worst part of the idea is they want to turn the entire Social Security trust fund over to Wall Street. That's what this is all about. Take all that money that people have been paying in for, you know, 75, 80 years and turn it over to Wall Street. I will never let that happen. That is the worst\u2014[applause]\u2014idea that is imaginable.\nI will also not let them voucherize Medicare, something else they want to do, and I will not let them privatize the VA. We have to fix the VA, but we are not going to take away guaranteed benefits from our veterans who have earned them through their service. That's not going to happen. [applause]\nAnd when it comes to foreign policy and national security, well, I think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe, and I have some ideas that I've been putting out based on what I did in the Senate after 9\/11, based on my work as secretary of State.\nIt's imperative that we do everything we can to defeat ISIS, to stop the flow of foreign fighters and funding to fight them on the Internet where they're quite effective without putting American troops back on the ground in either Syria or Iraq. [applause]\nThat will not happen. It's not\u2014it's not going to happen on my watch. And then we have to do a better job working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to keep us safe at home, and we have to do a better job sharing intelligence, getting intelligence that will help us prevent attacks.\nWhen I was a senator after 9\/11, I'd be kept up-to-date on all the threats that still were facing New York, and we had a very, very dedicated group of police and federal law enforcement and everyone who worked together. But, you know, one of the best things we did was a campaign which said, If you see something suspicious or you hear something suspicious, report it. And so people were picking up the phone and telling the police or maybe calling the FBI, and it really provided kind of the\u2014the eyes-on help that we needed. And people could then follow up, and we prevented attacks. We foiled attacks.\nWell, the reason I mention that is because of this. The Republican candidates, led by their frontrunner, have been attacking Muslims, right? You've heard that, attacking American Muslims, attacking Muslims around the world. That's not only shameful, it's dangerous. We need everybody in this country to be on the same team when it comes to preventing terrorist attacks. [applause]\nAnd we need people who are in the community who hear something, see something to report it and not feel like they're being demonized, defamed, insulted, pushed out. And certainly, if we're going to defeat ISIS, we need a coalition that includes Muslim nations.\nNow, I can tell you I built the coalition that imposed sanctions on Iran. I know a little bit about how you do this. You don't start by insulting people's religion and then ask them to be part of your effort to defeat a common adversary. [applause]\nThat's not the way it works in the real world. So we have to be smart about how we protect ourselves, and that will be my highest priority.\nI also want to continue to move toward comprehensive immigration reform, which I think is in the best interest of our country and our economy. [applause]\nAnd I want to let you know where I stand on a lot of the issues that the Republicans have taken positions on because they seem to be against so many of the fundamental rights that I support.\nI am for a woman's right\u2014a woman's right to make her own health decisions, and I am against defunding Planned Parenthood. [applause]\nI am for marriage equality and against discrimination against the LGBT community. I am against Citizens United, which is a terrible decision that has opened the doors to floods of unaccountable money from the Koch Brothers and others. And I would do everything I can to reverse that decision.\nI also want to keep pushing for criminal justice reform and reform in the incarceration system. And I want to fight for common sense gun safety measures that will help keep\u2014 [applause] \u2014Americans safe without infringing on gun owners' rights.\nWe are a smart\u2014we are a smart people. We can do this. And what I don't understand is how when we know we have, on average, 90 people a day dying from gun violence, 33,000 people a year, we cannot figure out how to protect people, protect first-graders going to school, people going to a movie theater, churchgoers going to Bible study. We can do this. We can't stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic, avoidable accident, but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybody's rights.\nAnd 92 percent of the American people agree with that, and 85 percent of gun owners agree with that. So we need somebody who will stand up to the gun lobby and stop them from intimidating common sense reforms in our country. [applause]\nSo we have a lot of work to do, my friends. And you have been really patient. The children who are still here have been especially patient, and I don't want to keep you any longer.\nI just want to say a few closing comments, and then for those of you who want to stay, I will shake your hands and take pictures and you can ask me questions. But everybody else can go home and not feel bad about it because I need you to get up tomorrow and help work to get more people to go to the caucus next Monday. [applause]\nAnd, you know, I am all about\u2014I am all about making progress against the odds. I am all about working with people. I worked with Republicans as first lady, as senator, as secretary of State. I worked to get results for the people I represented in the Senate as well as our country. I worked when I was secretary of State to make our country safe and to have our values and interests promoted. And I know how to find common ground because I've done it.\nI don't think that\u2014I think I\u2014I do believe that probably every Republican I served with at one time or another sponsored a piece of my legislation. Actually, when I'm not running for something, they say nice things about me. [laughter]\nEven in the case of Mr. Trump, they give me money because they think I'm so good as a candidate and a senator. So, you know, this is politics. This is all that that goes on.\nBut once the election is over, I will work as hard as I can to find that common ground, to get good things to happen for you, for your families, for your country and make it possible for young people to feel like I felt, that, you know, really the American Dream was available. You had to work for it, but if you did, you could get ahead and stay ahead. That's what I think about when it comes to my granddaughter. You know, I am the granddaughter of a factory worker, she is the granddaughter of a former president. I think it shouldn't matter. The grandchildren of everybody should have the same opportunities in our country. [applause]\nAnd that's what I am going to stand up for and fight for. And with your help, starting at the caucus next Monday night, that's what we will do together. Thank you all so much. [applause]\n","156":"\nTODD: This morning, there is some good news though for Clinton. She won the endorsement of the \"Des Moines Register\". By the way, as did Marco Rubio on the Republican side but one would argue the \"Des Moines Register\" will probably have a greater impact among Democratic caucus goers.\nSo joining me from Cedar Rapids, Iowa is the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Madam Secretary\u2014welcome back.\nCLINTON: Thank you\u2014Chuck. It's good to talk to you this morning.\nTODD: You got it.\nLet me just start with this. Your opponent 74 years old, calls himself a socialist, started this campaign with next to zero name recognition. You have 38 of 44 U.S. senators endorsing, 12 of 18 Democratic governors. He has zero.\nWhat happened? What's gone wrong? Save me the \"we always knew this was going to be a close race\" answer.\nCLINTON: Well Chuck\u2014look, I think it's actually good for the debate that we're having that there is so much interest and energy that I feel on my side and I know, obviously so does senator Sanders on his.\nWe have a big choice to make. And it's exciting. I had a great couple of events yesterday. I'm enthusiastically pursuing the opportunity to reach every single voter in Iowa and we're going to see what happens. I feel good about where we are. Obviously, we'll find out a week from tomorrow.\nBut if you look at the differences between Senator Sanders and myself, I just don't think we can't wait. We can't wait to make progress on the myriad of issues that I think we're going to be facing in the next administration. I want to build on the progress that President Obama has made and he has a different approach. And that's what voters are trying to determine, which they prefer.\nTODD: Look, as you know, the caucuses sometimes are about passion, enthusiasm. Let me read you something that was in the \"New York Times\" from Gayle Collins. \"Nevertheless, you can't ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton is now the candidate of the aging Democratic establishment whose supporters pray for a low turnout on the Election Day. That might get her nominated in the long run but it's not really the kind of image that makes you go whistling into the election booth.\"\nBy the way, she wrote that in 2008. By the way, she wrote that in 2008, Madam Secretary. Is there a deja vu happening here?\nCLINTON: No, there isn't. I just have to tell you, can only react to what I'm doing, feeling, getting responses from people. And you know, I feel great that we have the level of enthusiasm that we do and we also have a really good team on the ground that has been working for months to make sure that it's not just here today, gone tomorrow. But people are involved. They are really reached out to and yes, we believe they're going to come caucus. So, you know, the speculation and all the rest of it is entertaining, I admit that. But we're just going to keep moving forward and do the work that we think is going to be successful on February 1st.\nTODD: Are you worried that experience, your long resume, is not an asset in this wild year?\nCLINTON: No, I'm really not. Because I think at the end of the day people take this vote seriously. They know they're voting for who they prefer to be the next president and commander in chief, and I believe that when I am out there talking with people about what we have to go up against here at home, get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, begin to raise incomes, which hasn't happened, deal with health care, going from 90 percent coverage, which is what we have under the Affordable Care Act now, to 100 percent and I lay out what intend to do to get there.\nI can only tell you they see people nodding. I know people are signing up as they leave my events. That's what matters here. It's very personal, and people look and they think, can we imagine this person to be president and commander in chief? And because of my experience, particularly my years as secretary of state working with President Obama, I think that's something that people really take into account.\nTODD: What are you willing to\u2014you know, it's interesting, your husband used a lot of political capital\u2014you and your husband used a lot of political capital to do health care. President Obama, arguably, used all of his political capital to get health care passed.\nWhat is it? What is the one issue you are going to be willing to use all your political capital to focus on? You and I both know you basically have one big shot at one big issue. What is it that you're willing to use all your political capital to do with?\nCLINTON: Well, Chuck, first of all, I don't agree with you on that. I think that there are several really important issues, health care being one of them. We've got to get costs down. I met a man on Friday who no longer can afford to pay for his HIV medication. I met a woman yesterday whose bill for the drugs she must take and has taken for 25 years has gone from a couple hundred to over $14,000 for the same amount of the drug.\nThat really hits my heart. I know what people are going through. I'm going to use whatever tools I can to get us lower prices, cap those prescription drug companies and take that on.\nBut I'm also going to focus on the economy because unless we create more jobs and get incomes rising and fix the tax system so that it doesn't in so many ways tilt toward the wealthy, people are not going to get ahead, they're not going to feel they're getting ahead and they're going to still believe that the government, the economy is rigged against them which is bad for our democracy. TODD: As you know, your opponent Senator Sanders has been hitting you on Wall Street contributions and including some paid speeches that you did for Goldman Sachs among other banks. Let me ask you this\u2014why do you think one of these big banks paid you over $200,000 for a speech?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I gave speeches to a wide array of groups from health care groups to auto dealers and many, many more, and I think what they were interested in because what we talked about was the world coming off of four years as secretary of state in a complicated world, people were interested in what I saw, what I thought, they asked questions about matters that were on their minds. A lot of interest in the bin laden raid, how such a tough decision was made and what I advised the President. You know, I think Americans who are doing business in every aspect of the economy want to know more about the world. I actually think it's a good conversation for people to be having.\nTODD: You don't think they expect anything in return?\nCLINTON: Absolutely not. You know, first of all, I was a senator from New York. I took them on when I was senator. I took on the carried interest loophole. I took on what was happening in the mortgage markets. I was talking about that in 2006. They know exactly where I stand.\nAnd I'll tell you, Chuck, it's really interesting to me that now Karl Rove has taken money from the financial interest to run an ad against me to try to influence Democrats not to support me. Why? Ask yourself why.\nBecause he knows number one I know what must be done, and number two I know how to get it done to make sure that Wall Street writ large, not just the banks but the investment banks, the hedge funds and everybody else, no longer can wreck our economy the way they did in 2008.\nTODD: All right. Two more quick questions.\nThe \"Des Moines Register\" editorial, in praising you and your experience, did bring up the e-mail issue as one of those things that they're frustrated with how you responded to it.\nLet me just ask you this question. Last week you were asked about the FBI investigation. Are you concerned? You said you haven't been contacted by them. Are you concerned this investigation is taking too long? That it's putting an extra cloud over your candidacy and until it gets behind you, you're sort of going to have these issues and Michael Bloomberg even cited it as a reason why he's thinking about running.\nCLINTON: No, I'm not concerned because I know what the facts are. I never sent or received any material marked classified. I cannot control what the Republicans leak and what they are contending. And I said it was interesting, Chuck\u2014you'll as a political observer understand why. You know, back a couple of months ago Kevin McCarthy spilled the beans that the Benghazi investigation was all about bringing me down, something that I suspected but I went ahead, testified for 11 hours, answered all their questions, and even they admitted there was nothing new.\nAnd now Senator Grassley shows up at a Trump rally yesterday in Iowa. He's the chairman of the judiciary committee who has\u2014and his staff have been behind and pushing a lot of these stories, and announces he's there for the simple reason, to defeat me.\nI can't control what the Republicans are doing. But I know what the facts are and I will just keep putting them out there. This is something that I think is very clear about what happened and I know it will be over and resolved at some point. But I can't control what the Republicans and their allies do. But I think it's important voters know what they're doing.\nTODD: And Michael Bloomberg? Your reaction to his potential candidacy?\nCLINTON: He's a good friend of mine, and I'm going to do the best I can to make sure that I get the nomination, and we'll go from there.\nTODD: So you're not worried about him getting in?\nCLINTON: Well, the way I read what he said is if I didn't get the nomination he might consider it. Well, I'm going to relieve him of that and get the nomination so he doesn't have to.\nTODD: All right. Madam Secretary\u2014stay safe on the trail. We'll catch up with you soon.\nCLINTON: Thank you. Good to talk to you.\nTODD: Nice to talk with you.\n","157":"\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton going at it this week as we begin this campaign in 2016 just two weeks from the Iowa caucuses.\nSecretary Clinton joins us now from Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of tonight's big debate.\nGood morning, Madam Secretary.\nCLINTON: Good morning, George.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get to that back and forth between you and Bernie Sanders, but first the news that the American hostages from Iran are heading home this morning. Donald Trump not giving the president any credit and Marco Rubio says it's going to create incentives for other U.S. adversaries to take hostages.\nDoes he have a point?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I'm pleased, like I hope everybody is, that we have American citizens coming home this morning from Iran. They were unjustly held there, and I did a lot of work on these issues when Americans were being picked up, falsely charged and imprisoned, to get them home. So I applaud the fact that that's happened.\nWe still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, so we have unfinished questions and business still. But I think this is a part of what we're going to be pursuing\u2014persistent, patient diplomacy.\nToday's also the day that we have verified the Iranians have followed through on the requirements under the nuclear agreement. They have shipped out the vast majority, I think it's up to 98 percent, of their enriched uranium. They have poured cement into one of the reactors we worried about because of a plutonium potential threat. They have destroyed centrifuges.\nSo this is the kind of smart diplomacy I was proud to be a part of in the first administration of President Obama that we're just going to have to be persistent with, because we have a lot of problems with Iran\u2014their aggressive behavior, their destabilizing of neighboring states, their continuing military support for Assad and so much else.\nBut the fact that we've put the lid on the nuclear weapons program, the fact that we got our prisoners back, I think is a reason for good news.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get to the campaign right now.\nA strange series of events yesterday. The super PAC coordinating with you put out word that they'd be demanding to release of Bernie Sanders' health records. Sanders campaign struck back, calling that vile. Your campaign disavowed it. It appeared to go away.\nSo what is relevant here and what's not?\nShould age and health be an issue in this campaign?\nCLINTON: Oh, look, you know, I put out my medical records. I think you've been around long enough to know, George, this is all part of the expectation.\nBut I think it's fair to say that I share a lot of the same goals with Senator Sanders about what we need to do on behalf of our country. But we have differences. And that's what I'm focusing on now. We're going to have a spirited debate, I expect, tonight in Charleston. Certainly Senator Sanders has been pointing out differences.\nAnd one of the issues that I have drawn a very stark contrast on has been guns.\nYou know, I have pointed out repeatedly, because I think it's a critical issue, that Senator Sanders has, for years, voted many times on behalf of the NRA gun lobby position. And one of the most egregious of those votes was the vote to give immunity from all liability to gun makers and sellers. Now, I was happy when -\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He now supports taking that away.\nCLINTON: Well, he flip-flopped last night, said that he would sign on to a bill that is currently pending in the House and Senate to repeal that liability. And I'm delighted that he has had a change of heart. I think that's all for the good.\nNow I hope he will take a hard look at what we call the Charleston loophole. That's a provision he also voted for, that gives a gun to a potential buyer after three days whether or not the background check has been completed. And it's called the Charleston loophole because that's how the killer in Charleston got his gun when, if there had been a little more time, information would have come to light that would have shown he was prohibited. And, of course, we know he used that gun to go to Mother Emanuel Church and murder nine faithful people at Bible study.\nSo I want to see movement against the gun lobby, because we cannot continue to lose 90 people a day, 33,000 a year, to gun violence. And I welcome Senator Sanders moving on one of the issues he was wrong on. I hope he will continue to move.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And we're going to ask him about that in a few minutes.\nAnother big difference on health care. He wants to replace Obamacare with a single payer system, Medicare for all.\nSo are you against that because it's a bad idea or because it's not practical? Would a single payer system be better if you could get it passed?\nCLINTON: Well, first, I share the goal of universal health care. You know very well that I threw myself into that back in '93 and '94 and still have the scars to show for it. So the goal is we want everybody to have access to quality, affordable health care. But I think we should be defending the Affordable Care Act. This is a historic achievement for our country. It certainly is for President Obama. We are making progress. I want us to protect it, to defend it and to improve it.\nThe Republicans keep trying to repeal it and offer nothing in place of it. So rather than tear it apart or get rid of it and start all over again in a contentious national debate, let's do what I'm proposing, to get costs down, get out of pocket costs down, get more support for families who face big medical costs. Let's deal with the rising cost of prescription drugs. That, I think, is the right way for the country to go and it certainly is what I'm advocating.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You also have your differences over Wall Street. We've heard a little bit of that going into this. And I was struck this morning, American Crossroads, a super PAC founded by Karl Rove, who, of course, worked for President George W. Bush, has just launched this online ad in Iowa.\n[begin video clip]\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary Clinton's gotten 54 times more money from Wall Street interests than from all of Iowa. Hillary rewarded Wall Street with the $700 billion bailout. Then Wall Street made her a multi-millionaire.\nCLINTON: I represented Wall Street.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Huh, you sure did, Hillary.\n[end video clip]\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Now, that echoes the points being made by Bernie Sanders in his campaign.\nAre you worried that your ties to Wall Street are weighing you down?\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me say I think it shows how desperate the Republicans are to prevent me from becoming the nominee. I find that, in a perverse way, an incredibly flattering comment on their anxiety, because they know that not only will I stand up for what the country needs, I will take it to the Republicans. I have a track record which shows I know how to stand up to them. And I will win.\nSo I think this just proves my point, that I am the strongest candidate to go up against any Republican.\nWith the back and forth on Wall Street, I think it's, you know, look, I have stood up to Wall Street even though I did represent New York. I have advocated for changes. But what I find sort of strange is, number one, the ad that Senator Sanders ran was really against all Democrats who ever took any contributions from anybody associated with the financial industry. That would include President Obama, who took more anyone ever had in 2008. That did not stop him from turning around and imposing the toughest rules on Wall Street since the 1930s. The same with Barney Frank, who has actually written about this.\nYou know, that is just a false charge.\nBut in addition, I think it's important for us to look at our respective plans. In fact, everyone who has offered an opinion about the plan that Senator Sanders has proposed and the one I put together has said mine is tougher, mine is more comprehensive, it would be more effective, because it tries to get not just at the problems of yesterday, but the potential problems of tomorrow, going after shadow banking and investment banks and big insurance companies, like what we saw in '08 where Lehman Brothers and AIG were principal causes of what happened to us.\nAnd I think, finally, I would say that I have gotten maybe 3 percent of my - less than 3 percent of my contributions this time from anybody associated with financial industry activities. I've gotten so much more from students and teachers. Ninety percent of my contributions are from smaller donors and 60 percent from women.\nSo I'm just - you know, I didn't know about Karl Rove's ad against me, but it kind of boosts me up, because I assume he thinks that I am going to get the nomination and he's trying to interfere with the Iowa caucus to maybe confuse people on their way to caucus for me.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Madam Secretary, thanks very much for your time this morning.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nGood to talk to you, George.\n","158":"\nTODD: But we start with the Democrats and a Hillary Clinton\/Bernie Sanders race that has turned out to be much closer than the experts thought especially the Clinton campaign.\nIn fact, we have some brand new NBC News\/Wall Street Journal poll numbers out this morning and it does have some good news for the Clinton campaign. Nationally we still have her with a big lead over Bernie Sanders 59 percent-34 percent.\nBut in Iowa the story has been very different. Three polls out this week alone showing neck and neck race including our own NBC News\/Wall Street Journal\/Marist polls which had Clinton leading by jut 3; Quinnipiac found Sanders actually up by 5 and the \"Des Moines Register\" had Clinton up by just 2. Bottom line, it's too close to call.\nSo as they close the race it has become a more aggressive race against Sanders so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins Clinton campaign against Sanders and so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins us from Charleston, South Carolina. Good morning\u2014Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Good morning, Chuck.\nTODD: Let me start with the Iran deal. Yesterday in response to it you immediately said that Iran is still violating U.N. Security Council resolutions with its ballistic missile program which should be met with new sanctions, designations and firm results.\nSo I guess my question is what do you tell the American public that says you want new sanctions against Iran, they're still violating agreement and yet what did we do? We just handed them $100 billion and we just did a prisoner exchange. Would you have still done that considering your concerns about their missile program?\nCLINTON: Absolutely. Look I have said for a long time that I'm very proud of the role that I played in getting us to the point where we could negotiate the agreement that puts a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program but I've also said that the way we're going to hold them accountable is to have consequences when they do anything that might deviate from the agreement or continue to block the kind of sanctions and mandates the U.N. Security Council has put on, including on missiles.\nSo I see these as mutually reinforcing, Chuck. I was delighted that the prisoners are on their way home. That's a good sign. We still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, there's more work to be done there. But if the implementation of the agreement which is being done today is to be successful in the way that I expect we're going to watch Iran like the proverbial hawk.\nAnd when it comes to the missile program, they are under U.N. Security Council sanctions and if they are violating it which the evidence seems to suggest they should be held accountable. They need to know that this is a good step forward with respect to the nuclear weapons program but there are other areas of their behavior that we're going to continue to be focused on.\nTODD: Do you consider Iran a national security threat to the United States?\nCLINTON: Well, certainly we have lowered that threat because of the nuclear agreement but they continue to be destabilize governments in the Middle East. They continue to support proxies and terrorist groups like Hezbollah. They continue to threaten Israel. There are a lot of concerns. But what I've said for some time now is I'd rather have the nuclear weapons program off to one side and work to make sure they abide by the agreement and then turn our attention to some of these other behaviors that are threatening, certainly in the region and therefore cause concern for us.\nTODD: All right. Let me move to the campaign. To try to figure out why this race has gotten closer in Iowa, why your lead has shrunk in Iowa, we spoke to a number of voters. I want to play three sound bites from Iowa voters about some potential pause they have regarding your candidacy. I'm going to play it and get you to respond on the other side.\n[begin video clip]\nJAY HELTON, O'MALLEY SUPPORTER: You get the impression from her that she believes maybe the rules don't apply to her. Or the same rules don't apply to her that apply to everybody else.\nNATASHA NEWCOMB, SANDERS SUPPORTER: She's worked really hard and done some amazing things I just feel that Bernie Sanders is kind of\u2014has a little bit more fire lit up in people.\nSALLY WILSON, CLINTON SUPPORTER: Well, I hear people talking about questioning her honesty. And I don't necessarily do that but I think that's one thing people are kind of not sure and they've felt that way about Bill Clinton, too. So I think some of that rubs off.\n[end video clip]\nTODD: Madam Secretary, how do you answer that pause. This is from Democrats\u2014some pause that they have.\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, Chuck, I always thought this was going to be close and I can't speak for anybody else but I've worked as hard as I can to build an organization in Iowa, to be out there listening and talking with Iowans as they move toward making the first in the nation decision in the caucus on February 1.\nAnd I've also been very consistent over the course of my public life. If I tell you I'm going to fight for something, I will do my very best to get results. I think that's why I have such strong support and I feel very good about where we are but we're going to just keep working until the very last caucus is decided on February 1.\nTODD: You know, another problem you may be having in Iowa is that you don't ideologically fit. This was in the Des Moines Register poll this week. 43 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identify as socialist. Only 38 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identified themselves as a capitalist. You, in the last debate, said you were a capitalist. Bernie Sanders calls himself a Democratic socialist. If you don't win Iowa, do you think that's the reason?\nCLINTON: Oh, I don't know how people take all this information. But I support a free market economy. I support the competitiveness that has created the greatest economic engine in the history of the world. What I am worried about is that it's not continuing to do what it used to do which is to give the vast majority of Americans the chance to get ahead and stay ahead.\nThat's why I've got a very vigorous jobs agenda. That's why I put raising incomes at the center of my economic policy and I think what I know will work is to get back the good old-fashioned job opportunities that will help people get ahead through manufacturing, through infrastructure, through clean energy, through the kinds of plans that I've been putting out.\nLook, when we have a Democrat in the White House\u2014a Democrat\u2014we do that better economically. We saw that when my husband was president, we've watched President Obama dig us out of the huge ditch that Republican policies put us into, so I'm very confident that I know what will work if we have a\u2014the right commitment as a nation and that's what I want to do as president.\nTODD: Let me ask you about whether\u2014going with Chicago\u2014right now, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been under fire for what he may have known about a shooting incident. Do you think he still has the credibility to heal the wounds in Chicago between the African-American community and law enforcement?\nCLINTON: Look, like everybody else who watched that video on television I was just outraged by what happened to Laquan McDonald. I was one of the first to call for a complete Department of Justice investigation and, in fact, urged that it include the entire Chicago police department.\nThis is not a problem that is unique to Chicago, unfortunately, and we've got to do more to deal with the systemic racism and the problems that policing has demonstrated. Mayor Emanuel has said that he is committed to complete and total reform and I think he should be held to that standard.\nTODD: But do you think he still has the credibility to do that?\nCLINTON: Well, that's going to be up to him and up to the people of Chicago to prove.\nTODD: Very quickly, the movie \"13 Hours\" about the incident in Benghazi. I know there's a lot of chatter about the movie itself. But let me ask you\u2014the controversy involves whether or not everything was done that night to rescue Ambassador Stevens.\nLooking back, do you believe everything was done that night that could have been done to save his life?\nCLINTON: Based on everything I know and based on a Republican-led intelligence committee investigation, is a Republican-led arms services committee investigation, the answer to that is yes. That people were scrambling trying to figure out what could be done if anything.\nAnd I can't speak to a movie but I know people have raised questions about some of the dramatization. I testified for more than 11 hours, as you know I answered every question I was asked. My real focus, Chuck, is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harm's way\u2014military or civilian, diplomats or our soldiers\u2014we take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure that they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it.\nTODD: All right. Secretary Clinton, I have to leave it there. We look forward to seeing you tonight on stage in Charleston for the Democratic debate.\nCLINTON: Great.\nTODD: That's right here on NBC. Thank you.\nCLINTON: Thanks a lot.\nTODD: You got it.\nEND\nLOAD-DATE: January 17, 2016\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Transcript\nCopyright 2016 Federal News Service, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved \n\n\u00a0\n7 of 1079 DOCUMENTS\nFederal News Service\nJanuary 17, 2016 Sunday\nCBS \"Face the Nation\" Interview with Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Democratic Presidential Candidate\nLENGTH: 1189 words\n??????????????????????? Subject: The 2016 Presidential Race\nParticipants: John Dickerson\nTime: 10:30:00\nDate: 2016-01-17\nDICKERSON: And we start with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is in Charleston this morning. Good morning, Secretary Clinton.\nAfter this prisoner exchange, Senator Marco Rubio said\u2014quote\u2014\"If you take an American hostage, Barack Obama will cut a deal with you, whether it's Bowe Bergdahl, what he did with the Castro brothers, and now what he's done with Iran.\"\nYour reaction to that?\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's just typical political rhetoric, and it overlooks some very basic, important issues.\nNumber one, we always try to get Americans back who are unjustly held. I certainly did when I was secretary of state. And when I was a senator, I advocated for the Bush administration to do the same for people who have been unlawfully held in foreign countries.\nSecondly, the important news here is that the Iranian agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program of Iran is being implemented. The Iranians have so far fulfilled their side of the bargain by destroying centrifuges, by shipping out 98 percent or so of their enriched uranium out of their country, even making one of their plutonium reactors under construction no longer able to be ever used because they have poured cement into it.\nSo, the real issue here is, if you're committed to making the world safer and to show strong American leadership, you have to engage in patient, persistent diplomacy with people who are not your friends. They are on the other side of a lot of the issues and values that you hold very dear, and that is certainly true for the United States.\nDICKERSON: Former FBI agent Robert Levinson is still in Iran. Do you believe that the Iranians know where he is? And, if so, why wasn't he a part of this deal?\nCLINTON: Well, I regret deeply that Robert Levinson was not on his way home either. And I hope and expect that the Iranians will continue to be pressed very, very hard to give up any information they have and, if possible, to return Bob Levinson to his home and family.\nDICKERSON: Switching to the topic of gun control, you have said Bernie Sanders should vote or support the idea of lifting the immunity block on gun manufacturers. He now says he will support the legislation you have pushed him to. So, hasn't he done what you wanted him to do?\nCLINTON: Well, I am pleased that Senator Sanders has flip-flopped on legal immunity for gun makers and sellers. Now I hope he will also join members of Congress to change what's called the Charleston loophole that enabled the killer in Charleston to get the gun that he used to murder nine people at Bible study here in Mother Emanuel Church. That's something else Senator Sanders has supported that we need to change.\nSo, now I'm calling on him to also flip-flop in the right direction and sign on the legislation to change the Charleston loophole.\nDICKERSON: You at once in 1939 when you were first lady supported in testimony in front of the Senate Finance Committee a 25 percent tax on guns. You're not supporting that now or promoting that now.\nHow have you evolved over the years in terms of your support for the Second Amendment?\nCLINTON: Well, I do support the Second Amendment. That has always been understood.\nI just believe that, like any amendment to our Constitution, there are reasonable steps that can be taken. We have reasonable restrictions on certain kind of speech or certain forms of assembly. And for goodness sakes, we ought to be smart enough and do so consistent with the Constitution, to have more gun safety measures to try to save some of the 33,000 lives that we lose to gun violence every single year.\nThis is something that I have spoken out about, that I have advocated for right now. I think there is a consensus in the country on comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online and Charleston loopholes, reversing the immunity given to the gun industry, certainly prohibiting would-be terrorists on the no-fly zone from buying guns.\nThat's kind of the commonsense approach that we should be working to achieve.\nDICKERSON: I would like to ask you about these stories out of Flint, Michigan. Lead levels in the water have created an emergency there. Senator Sanders called for Rick Snyder, the governor, to resign. What is your feeling?\nCLINTON: Well, John, this is an issue I have been involved in now for a couple of weeks. I am horrified by what has happened in Flint.\nI started calling for immediate action, calling for federal intervention. I sent two of my top campaign aides to meet with the mayor of Flint. As you may know, I appeared on a show this past week and demanded that Governor Snyder ask for the help that Michigan needs to deal with the horrible consequences that children and their families are facing in Flint.\nAnd I saw that Governor Snyder turned around within two hours and finally asked for the help that he should have asked for some weeks ago. I don't want to get caught up in the political back and forth here. I want to help the people of Flint.\nAnd I particularly want a comprehensive health analysis of what's happened to these children. Lead is a poison. It destroys your brain. It interferes with your learning and your behavior. Whatever it takes for Michigan and the federal government to come together, through FEMA, through Health and Human Services, the EPA, whatever it takes, we now have to fix the problem and help these kids and especially their health and education development probably for years to come.\nDICKERSON: On the topic of health care back at the national level, you\u2014your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, said that Senator Sanders' universal health care plan will dismantle Obamacare, dismantle Children's Health Insurance Program, and a series of other things it would dismantle.\nAren't\u2014isn't she and your campaign not taking into account that those things would be replaced by an actual plan that Senator Sanders has put forward?\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's very confusing, because he hasn't put forward a plan.\nAnd the only way we know what it is he's advocating for comes from looking at the nine bills that he's introduced in the House and Senate and Congress. And in those bills, every kind of health care is rolled all up together, and handed over to the states, which bear a financial responsibility to match what the federal government provides in order to administer health care.\nSo, it's not a traditional kind of single-payer system, as I understand it. It is a state-based system, kind of similar to Medicaid, if you will. And I do think there are very legitimate questions that can be raised, and because we don't have an up-to-date plan from Senator Sanders, all of us trying to figure out what it would mean for everybody to be put into that new system.\nDICKERSON: All right.\nWell, Senator\u2014excuse me\u2014Secretary Clinton, I know that will be debated this evening when you're on the stage with Senator Sanders.\nWe thank you for being with us.\nCLINTON: Great to talk to you again, John.\n\n","159":"\nTAPPER: We're joined right off the bat by Democratic candidate for president and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nMadam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us.\nOn Saturday, you called for new sanctions against Iran for its ballistic missile program. That prompted a response from another American who was once held prisoner in Iran, Shane Bauer, one of the hikers released in 2011. He had some tough words for you on Twitter, writing\u2014quote\u2014\"Seriously, why would Hillary call for more sanctions now? As far as we know, four of the Americans are still in Iran. Totally irresponsible\"\u2014unquote.\nHe also said, whenever he was in Iran, whenever he heard your voice, his heart would sink, because\u2014quote\u2014\"All she ever does with Iran is inflame tensions.\"\nI want to give you awe chance to respond.\nCLINTON: Well, look, I appreciate what he went through when he was held prisoner in the infamous Iranian prison.\nAnd we were very happy that we were able to get him and the two other hikers back home. But we have a very clear path we are pursuing with Iran. I am pleased that we do have an agreement that is being implemented. And I was part of putting that in place by getting the sanctions imposed on Iran that the entire world went along with.\nBut we also have made it clear from the beginning that their missile activity is still subject to sanction. That is part of the overall approach that the administration has taken toward Iran, and that I support.\nSo, when we became aware of missile activity that is under U.N. supervision and is prohibited, it would be a mistake not to make clear to Iran that we are very, very happy to see us implementing the agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program and the way that they have complied, but that doesn't mean they can now go off and invest and test a lot of missiles that would eventually be able to be intercontinental that could reach the United States and maybe carry a very dangerous weapon.\nSo, I think there might be a misunderstanding of what our whole agreement consists of, because, certainly, I have made clear I'm proud of the role that I played in getting that agreement in place, but, as president, I will enforce it.\nAnd there have to be consequences if Iran veers away from what it has agreed to or what it has been mandated to do or prohibited from doing by the international community.\nTAPPER: Let's turn to politics, obviously a big night tonight, a Democratic debate.\nYou will be facing off with Bernie Sanders in this new, more contentious phase of the election, with just a week and a\u2014two weeks and a day until the Iowa caucuses.\nOne of your top allies, David Brock, is calling on Bernie Sanders to release his medical records. The Sanders campaign\u2014campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, he called this\u2014quote\u2014\"one of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable.\"\nWho's right there, David Brock or Jeff Weaver? [laughter]\nCLINTON: Well, I don't know anything about it, but I have released my medical records.\nAnd I remember being asked frequently for me to do so. And, so, obviously that's, you know, something I will leave up to the Sanders campaign.\nBut this is a spirited debate, because, although we share some very similar goals for our country, we have differences. And Senator Sanders has been pointing them out.\nOne of my biggest differences has been on guns. And I'm very pleased that he flip-flopped on the immunity legislation. Now I hope he will flip-flop on what we call the Charleston loophole, and join legislation to close that, because it's been a key argument of my campaign that we Democrats, in fact, Americans need to stand up to the gun lobby and pass comprehensive commonsense gun measures that will make America safer. And that's what I intend to do.\nTAPPER: One of your major lines of attack against Bernie Sanders, in addition to the gun one that you just leveled, has been on his proposal for single-payer health care.\nBack in 1994, you said a single-payer system administrated by the states would actually lower health care costs. Take a listen.\n[begin video clip from 1994]\nCLINTON (in 1994): Single-payer would have lower costs. And one of the reasons that the president has a provision in his approach that guarantees states can go single-payer is to permit states that are able to do that to start down the single-payer road.\n[end video clip]\nTAPPER: Now, I know that was a long time ago, but you said in the Q&A single-payer would not be politically feasible.\nIn a perfect world, do you believe that single-payer would ultimately lower health care costs?\nCLINTON: Well, I believe in universal health care. And I think we have now, finally, after many decades of efforts, thanks to President Obama, a plan that will get us to universal health care. It's the Affordable Care Act. So, I'm not interested in what the Republicans are trying to do, which is to repeal it, as they consistently vote to do. And I also think it would be a mistake to really thrust our country into another contentious national debate about how we're going to provide quality, affordable health care to everybody. So, I'm...\nTAPPER: Right, but just on the merits.\nCLINTON: ... very focused on\u2014well, the merits are we need to get to universal health care. That is the merit.\nThe merit is, how do we get to universal health care, where everybody's covered, where everybody can afford it? We have had some experimentation with states. Actually, Vermont tried to do single-payer. They found that the cost and the taxes that were required were prohibitive.\nColorado now has a referendum on its ballot, so it's going to also pursue it. I'm a big believer in letting states experiment. But when it comes to where we are right now, in 2016, I'm going to defend, protect, and improve the Affordable Care Act.\nTAPPER: For years, you have been very protective of your daughter, Chelsea Clinton, especially when she was a child, of course, and now she's a grown woman.\nThis week, she surprised a lot of people when she unleashed one of the most scathing attacks of the cycle, accusing Bernie Sanders of wanting to empower Republican governors who might then cut people's health care.\nPolitiFact called Chelsea's remarks mostly false. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said it was not an honest attack. And liberal columnist Mark Shields said the attack turned your daughter into a\u2014quote\u2014\"political hack.\"\nDo you think it was a mistake to muddy up Chelsea like that?\nCLINTON: Look, she was asked a question. I love my daughter. And she answered a question.\nAnd all I can say, Jake, is that the only health plan we know of from Senator Sanders is what's described in the legislation that he has introduced nine times in the Congress, in the Senate. And it does turn all of the programs we know of that provide health care over to the states.\nThe federal government would provide a big portion of the cost, but states would be mandated to also pay considerably, about 14 percent of the cost. That's what's in his bill.\nSo, I think anyone who wants to compare and contrast, since we don't have any more current plan from Senator Sanders, has to look at the legislation that he introduced.\nAnd, yes, if it were going to be state-run, then governors, Republican and Democrat alike, would bear responsibility for appropriating the funds and administrating it, according to Senator Sanders' own legislative proposals.\nTAPPER: So, no regrets about using Chelsea that way?\nCLINTON: Oh, I didn't use her. She answered a question.\nAnd, you know, she gave a factual answer, based on the legislation that is the only way we know what Senator Sanders is actually proposing, because he introduced it nine times in the Congress.\nTAPPER: OK. PolitiFact said it was mostly false, but let's move on.\nA new movie opened this weekend. It's called \"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.\" It's a cinematic version of a book, a nonfiction book, telling the story of the six private security contractors who defended the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, from an attack by Islamic militants.\nAre you planning to see it at all?\nCLINTON: I'm just too busy campaigning. I am still very focused on making sure we do everything we can, as I did when I was secretary of state, as I testified to over 11 hours, to make sure that nothing like that happens again, insofar as we are able to prevent it.\nAnd that's my focus when it comes to the continuing obligation that the United States government has whenever we send anyone into harm's way.\nTAPPER: Let's talk about ISIS. It's a big concern among many Americans.\nI know that you're very reluctant to criticize President Obama, and I understand that. But I want to ask you about the situation in Syria on the ground, because Anne-Marie Slaughter, who is the former director of policy planning at the State Department under you, she told me on my show \"THE LEAD that, if President Obama had listened to you about arming the Syrian moderates years ago, there's a\u2014quote\u2014\"very good chance that we would not be facing ISIS like we are now.\"\nDo you agree?\nCLINTON: Well, we will never know the answer to that question.\nObviously, I thought, at the time, it was the right approach. And I advocated for it, along with then Secretary Panetta and CIA Director Petraeus, because I was worried about what would happen if there were a very vicious civil war, when, on one side, you had Assad's army backed by Iran, and now we know also backed by Russia, against a group of people who wanted more freedom, wanted to live in dignity, not the continuing oppression from the Assad regime, that it would be a pretty uneven match, to be understating that, and it could open territory for terrorist groups, foreign fighters, and others to come in.\nSo, let's talk about where we are now. And I have laid out a plan to deal with ISIS about airpower that is being used now, with more nations joining the United States, which is in the lead, to try to go after ISIS leadership, infrastructure, other assets, also to support Iraqi and Syrian fighters who are on the ground trying to take territory back from ISIS, and what else we need to do to build up those forces, the Iraqi army, which has had some success taking back Ramadi, Sunni tribal fighters, which we have to get back into the fight, and that is beginning to happen, and supporting the Kurdish fighters, who have been extraordinary brave on both sides of the border, by helping to equip and support them.\nSo, we have a clear mission to deprive ISIS of territory. And there is some movement, positive movement on that. And then we have to cut off their foreign fighters, their foreign funding, and take them online\u2014take them on online, so that they are no longer able to recruit and propagandize, which keeps their flow of fighters and money coming.\nTAPPER: I'm told we're out of time. I just have one last question for you.\nIn terms of the status of the FBI investigation into your private e-mail server, have you been interviewed by the FBI yet?\nCLINTON: No.\nTAPPER: You haven't.\nAll right, Secretary Clinton, thanks so much. Really appreciate your time. Good luck with the debate tonight.\nCLINTON: Thanks. Thanks, Jake.\n","160":"\nCAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for sitting down with us here in Iowa.\nCLINTON: Thank you, Alisyn.\nCAMEROTA: We are in Ames, Iowa --\nCLINTON: Yes.\nCAMEROTA:\u2014where the temperature as we speak is one degree.\nCLINTON: Uh-hm.\nCAMEROTA: And I know that you have been going to countless campaign events here and I'm wondering when you get up in the morning in Iowa if there are ever times you question your life choices?\nCLINTON: Absolutely, no. You know, I grew up in Chicago. I'm used to cold weather. It doesn't bother me. In fact, I'm somewhat reassured that there is a real winter, that we are actually seeing snow and lower temperatures. But I get up every day whether I'm in Iowa, in New Hampshire, wherever I am in the country and I really look forward to the day because I find the opportunity to go out and listen to people, hear their stories, give them my views about what I think the next president should do very energizing and very, you know, reinvigorating all the time.\nCAMEROTA: So, let's talk about the tightening race between you and Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is speaking to reporters on Monday night here in Iowa. And he said that your campaign is in, quote, \"serious trouble.\" Is that how you feel?\nCLINTON: Not at all. In fact, I have always known that if you are going to run to be president, particularly in the Democratic Party, it's a long, hard, challenging road. And so I've been in these elections before. They always tighten up as people begin to make up their minds, as they look at the candidates, totally predictable. I feel really, really good about the campaign organization that I have. A caucus is different from a primary. It takes a lot of intensive work to convince people to come out on a cold Monday night, spend a couple of hours in order to stand up for your candidate, but I'm asking Iowans if they'll stand up for me on caucus night. I will be standing up for them all through my presidency.\nCAMEROTA: There is a new Quinnipiac poll out just about one hour ago in which Bernie Sanders is now beating you in Iowa. It is 49 percent to 44 percent. It is the first time that this has happened that he's been beating you in Iowa since September. We are 20 days out. Does he have more momentum than you?\nCLINTON: Well, the funny thing Alisyn is, after that poll came out about an hour later there was a PPP poll where I was leading him by the same margin about six points up. I don't pay any attention to this. I don't feel that it's a good reflection about who will actually come out on caucus night. I can only tell you that the energy, the enthusiasm, the excitement of my volunteers, my organizers, the voters who come, who sign up on commit to caucus cards is just building. That's my experience. So I'll let people poll and try to figure out who is going to show up. I'm looking at people who are showing up, making up their minds and trying to, you know, convince them to come out and caucus for me.\nCAMEROTA: Why don't you feel that the polls are good reflection of what's going to happen in the caucus?\nCLINTON: Because they are so unpredictable. And it's gotten increasingly difficult to poll. And I think you would have to add a degree of difficulty to polling for a caucus. So, that's been my experience. I've watched this a long time. I've had a prior election where I campaigned in Iowa. So, I just put that aside. I'll let pundits and others worry about who's up and who's down. I just get up every day like we were saying, going out there, making my case, drawing the contrast because I have the highest regard for my two opponents, but there are real differences. And we need a spirited debate. Because after the first of the year, a lot more people start paying attention. And now I know it's, you know, the make or break time, people make up their minds.\nCAMEROTA: Bernie Sanders is also winning in New Hampshire. Not surprising. He is from a neighboring state. Have you considered what would happen if he wins in Iowa and New Hampshire what your plan is?\nCLINTON: I don't think about that. I'm going to do everything I can to win as bigger margin as possible in the caucus and then go to the primary. But this is a national campaign. We've been organizing in South Carolina, in Nevada, a lot of the March 1st states, the March 15th states. Remember, I campaigned all the way into June last time. And I have always thought that given the unpredictability and the, you know, changes in people's concerns going into this election, that we wouldn't know exactly how the outcome would be for, you know, a couple of cycles of these primaries and caucuses. So, I'm going to do my best to convince more Iowans to come out and caucus for me. And even though as you say, Senator Sanders as a neighbor and a neighbor never lost in New Hampshire, I'm going to take that challenge on and do the best I can to get people in New Hampshire to support me, as well.\nCAMEROTA: Vice President Joe Biden offered his thoughts to CNN on why he thinks Bernie Sanders is resonating. He said that he thinks it's about Senator Sanders' positions on income inequality. And the Vice President said, quote, \"It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that. That's been Bernie's. No one questions Bernie's authenticity on those issues.\" What's your reaction?\nCLINTON: Well, the Vice President who I deeply respect and regard as a friend, went on to say as I recall. But, you know, Hillary Clinton has a lot of very good economic policies that are thoughtful and on and on. Look, I have been working toward closing the gaps between people, poor people and well-off people primarily all my adult life. I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I helped to reform the education system in Arkansas. I was a legal services lawyer defending poor people. I went to work to try to make sure that we got health care in the beginning of my husband's administration because of so many people who were left out and were uninsured.\nI have been on this issue in many different ways. How do we make education more equal? How do we make health care more equal? Of course that's tied to income equality, but there is also a broader range of issues that I have a long record of addressing. And when I was in the Senate I took on corporate executive pay. A lot of the abuses that I thought were there. I took on these derivatives and credit default swaps that contributed to the collapse of the economy and the great recession. I stood up to Wall Street. I called them out. So I have a very long record. I have a broader agenda. It's not the only thing I talk about because I think you have to view equality of opportunity and how we deliver that in the 21st Century for many different perspectives and that's what I tried to do.\nCAMEROTA: And since you have been devoting much of your career to talking about this, why do you think the Vice President would say, it's more in Bernie's wheelhouse and it's about his authenticity?\nCLINTON: Oh, I don't know. But you know, I have a lot of regard for the vice president. And I think today he clarified what he said and said he was talking about me when I was Secretary of State. Well, when I was Secretary of State, I couldn't talk about domestic policy. There is an unwritten rule, you do not meddle in domestic policy when you are secretary of state or for that matter, secretary of defense. So yes, for four years, despite a long career both in and out of public service where I have been relentless in talking about these issues, there were four years when I did not. I talked about how we were going to get Iran to the negotiating table and try to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon, how we're going to, you know, deal with a rising China, what we're going to do about women's rights, something that goes to the heart of inequality. So, I had a different agenda because I had a different job.\nCAMEROTA: So, you didn't take Biden's comments as a slight?\nCLINTON: No. Not at all.\nCAMEROTA: OK. You are introducing your tax plan. One of the headlines is that you would impose a four percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million. And I believe that that would raise about $150 billion over ten years. Does that go far enough in addressing income inequality?\nCLINTON: Well, we've got a variety of proposals. Not only the four percent surcharge which I call the fair share surcharge. The so-called Buffet Rule which would have a minimum tax rate for people making more than $1 million, limiting deductions to 28 percent with a charitable exception. Going after a lot of the subsidies that, for example, still subsidize the oil and gas industry about $6 billion a year while we have to move toward a clean renewable energy future. So I have put forth plans, paid family leave, tuition, debt-free tuition for public colleges.\nCapping prescription drug costs and much more. And it would cost about $100 billion a year, all of which I pay for. In contrast, Senator Sanders has some very big ideas, but he hasn't yet told anybody how he would pay for them. And he had promised that he would roll out his tax plans before the Iowa caucus on February 1st. Well, if you wait too long, nobody will have a chance to see them or analyze them. And so I am very clear about what I would do and how I would pay for it.\nCAMEROTA: Another point of conflict between you and Senator Sanders is on gun policy.\nCLINTON: Uh-hm.\nCAMEROTA: We just watched this very emotional event this morning.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nCAMEROTA: That you were involved in where this mom who lost two children --\nCLINTON: Right --\nCAMEROTA:\u2014to gun violence got up and spoke. And it was really heartbreaking to hear her. It sounds like she lost her children to criminals.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nCAMEROTA: So, how would you stop that?\nCLINTON: This is a very big difference in this campaign. Because as you saw, I received the Brady campaign endorsement today and both the woman Delfin Cherry who introduced us to the stage and the head of the Brady campaign had lost family members. It was really hard standing up there because I have held the hands of and listened to countless people who have lost family members to gun violence. And I agree completely with the President about us having to take action now. We lose on an average 90 people a day. It has to stop, Alisyn. I've been in this campaign advocating for comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what's called the Charleston loophole.\nYou know, there was a loophole, my opponent voted for it, Senator Sanders, that at the end of three days, business days, you get that gun whether they have finished the background check or not. The killer in Charleston who bought that gun, if there had just been a little more time, it would have been discovered he should not have been able to buy the gun because he had a federal record. We have saved a lot of lives. I can't put an exact number on it. But because of the Brady bill which Senator Sanders voted against five times, more than two million people, the Brady campaign says, 2.4 million purchasers have been stopped from buying guns.\nSo, we are talking about violent criminals. We are talking about domestic abusers. We are talking about the dangerously mentally ill. We are even talking about terrorists because the Republicans won't close the loophole so that people on the no fly zone can buy guns. I feel passionately about this. And the cumulation from Sandy Hook to the community college in Oregon, the fact that we have so many mass killings in the last few years, I think it certainly motivated the President, and I am so proud to support him and I want to make this a voting issue in this campaign.\n[break]\nCAMEROTA: I want to talk about an issue Donald Trump wanted to make an issue in this campaign, that is\u2014are allegations from your husband's past. He is going further actually than that. He is making it about you. He is saying that you are an enabler of bad behavior and of sexual assault.\nWhat's your response to Donald Trump?\nCLINTON: I have no response. I'm going to let him say whatever he wants to say. He can run his campaign however he wishes. I'm going to keep talking about what the next president will have to do starting January 20th, 2017.\nI have deep disagreements with what he's proposing. His tax plans would cut trillions of dollars of taxes from the wealthy and corporations. He doesn't believe in equal pay. He thinks that American workers are already making too much.\nSo, I'm going to draw the contrast with him that I think the American people are interested in seeing.\nCAMEROTA: But when someone accuses you of being an enabler of sexual assault, don't you need to respond to it? I mean, particularly since this is an issue you wanted to talk about on the campaign trail. Can't this sexual assault\u2014you say survivors need to be believed and they need to be heard.\nSo, when he's accusing you of doing something that is the antithesis of what you want to talk about, don't you need to address it?\nCLINTON: I'm going to let the American voters decide what's relevant and what's not relevant in their decision as to who they're going to support.\nCAMEROTA: I have a few more questions. Donald Trump was on \"The Tonight Show\" and asked about the possibility of you two running against each other, if that's how this all plays out in November. He said that would be, quote, \"an amazing thing.\" [laughter]\nCLINTON: Yes, it would be amazing. I would look forward to it.\nLook, I think this is serious business. Campaigns always have some great stories and great characters. That's part of the political process. This is really serious business, who the next president is. We are either going to build on the progress that we've made or we're going to see it ripped away. We are either going to defend human rights and civil rights and women's rights and gay rights and voting rights and workers' rights and all the rest that is at stake, or we are going to turn the clock back.\nAnd that's why I have tried to very clearly explain where I stand on all of these issues because the stakes are so high. And if I'm fortunate enough to get the nomination, I will run hard against whomever the Republicans' nominee, because they represent a brand of politics and policies that I think would hurt our country. I don't want to see that happen.\nCAMEROTA: Let's say you get the nomination. Let's say you win the presidency.\nCLINTON: Yes, let's say that.\nCAMEROTA: Let's say it.\nAnd on day one, you walk into the Oval Office, what's the first phone call you make?\nCLINTON: Well, I think the very first phone call would be to whoever I've asked to be the chief of staff of the White House. Let's get a meeting together, let's get our agenda together. There's a lot we have to get going. The earlier we start, the better we'll be off and we'll get more accomplished.\nBecause I want to really think hard if I do get the nomination, right then and there, how we organize the White House, how we organize the cabinet. What's the legislative agenda?\nYou know, the time between an election and inauguration is short. You can't wait. I mean, you can't take anything for granted. You have to keep working as hard as you possibly can, but I think it's important to start planning because we know what happens if you get behind in getting your agenda out and getting your appointments made. You lose time. And you're not doing the work that the American people elected you to do.\nCAMEROTA: Before I let you go, I definitely want to ask you about your granddaughter. You talk about her on the campaign trail. Today is I believe or recently, Chelsea is making her first appearance on the campaign trail.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nCAMEROTA: She said she believes that you becoming a grandmother is a driving force behind your campaign. How so?\nCLINTON: Well, she's right, because I feel very fortunate. I like to point out I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker who came to this country as a young immigrant. Went to work in the lace mills in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\nSo, here I am three generations later asking people to vote for me to become their president. And we have this amazing 15-month-old grandchild with another on the way next summer. And so, I think a lot about the future, but I think not just about her future because we're going to do everything we can to make sure she has the best opportunities life can offer, but I think about what kind of country she'll become an adult in and what kind of world is going to be waiting for her.\nI want to make sure\u2014it's not just our grandchild, but every child who has the opportunity to go as far to fulfill their God-given potential as possible. And a lot of that depends on the kinds of decisions that our presidents make. It's not, you know, you have to have family support, you have to have community support.\nI wrote a book called \"It Takes A Village.\" I understand that. Do you kids have health care? That's why I created the children's health care insurance program, because too many didn't. Your kids have good education, that's why I'm for early childhood, because too many kids come to school unprepared. How about college affordability? Too many kids are weeded out because they can't afford to start or stay.\nI go through the list of what is really dampening the opportunities that young people in our country have right now. And I want to be the president who unleashes that potential again.\nCAMEROTA: And when you think about your grandchildren's future, are you worried or hopeful?\nCLINTON: I'm always hopeful, Alisyn. I'm always hopeful. I think this is the greatest country.\nWhen I listen to the negative comments made about our country on the campaign stage predominantly by the Republicans, I mean, look at what we've come back from. It was a Republican administration under which we had the Great Recession. That is just a fact.\nPresident Obama inherited an economy that was losing 800,000 jobs a month. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out and getting us standing again. So, I know that choices really matter in politics, but I am absolutely committed to the belief, the conviction that I have that our country is resilient, we're strong, we're smart.\nGiven the right leadership, we can do anything. That's why I actually am quite optimistic and confident about the future.\nCAMEROTA: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much.\nCLINTON: Thank you, Alisyn.\nCAMEROTA: Great to talk to you.\nCLINTON: It's great to see you.\n","161":"\nDICKERSON: We're going to get right to our lead guest, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is in Chappaqua, New York, this morning.\nGood morning, Secretary Clinton.\nI want to start with politics. We're going to talk about a lot today, but let's start with politics. A new NBC\/\"Wall Street Journal\"\/Marist poll says in Iowa it's 48-45, you over Sanders. You were once way ahead. So, what's happening?\nCLINTON: Oh, John, you know these polls go up, they go down.\nI stay pretty focused, as I think we all should, on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration, but go even further. And that's why I have outlined a very significant agenda to raise wages and to take on the gun lobby and to be making America safe in every way that I can.\nAnd those are some of the differences that I have with my primary opponents, and certainly very deep differences with all the Republicans running.\nDICKERSON: This week, another batch of your e-mails were released by the State Department.\nOne of them is a back-and-forth between you and a staffer about a secure fax that won't come through. And you directed him to -- quote -- \"turn into non-paper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure.\"\nAren't you ordering him to violate the laws on handling classified material there?\nCLINTON: No, not at all.\nAnd as the State Department said just this week, that did not happen. And it never would have happened, because that's just not the way I treated classified information. Headings are not classification notices. And so, oftentimes, we're trying to get the best information we can.\nAnd, obviously, what I'm asking for is whatever can be transmitted, if it doesn't come through secure, to be transmitted on the unclassified system. So, no, there is nothing to that, like so much else that has been talked about in the last year.\nDICKERSON: So, in no instance -- what is striking about that particular e-mail is it suggests you were very facile with how to do this, this process. You knew the instructions about how to get around the restrictions for sending classified information.\nSo you're saying there was never an instance, any other instance in which you did that?\nCLINTON: No. And it wasn't sent. So, I think this is another instance where what is common practice -- namely, look, I need information. I had some points I had to make. And I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture.\nBut, oftentimes, there's a lot of information that isn't at all classified. So, whatever information can appropriately transmitted unclassified often was. That's true for every agency in the government and who everybody does business with the government.\nBut the important point here is, I had great confidence, because I had worked with Jake Sullivan for years. He is the most meticulous, careful person you could possibly do business with. And he knew exactly what was and wasn't appropriate.\nAnd, in fact, as the State Department has said, there was no transmission of any classified information. So, it's another effort by people looking for something to throw against the wall, as you said in the beginning of the program, to see what sticks. But there's no there there.\nDICKERSON: Well, this one is a little different, since the FBI is investigating this specific question of whether a classification was meddled with.\nLet me ask you about another e-mail in this batch, which was one in which you seemed to express surprise that somebody e-mailed on their non-State Department personal e-mail, which is what you were doing. Why was that a surprise to you?\nCLINTON: Well, I e-mailed two people on their government accounts, because I knew that all of that would be part of the government system.\nAnd, indeed, the vast majority of all my e-mails are in the government system. So, that's how I conducted the business. I was very clear about e-mailing anything having to do with business to people on their government accounts.\nDICKERSON: On gun control this week, you have been pretty tough on Bernie Sanders, specifically on the question of legal protection to gun manufacturers.\nHe has now said that he would be interested in looking to changing the law to allow -- to go after gun manufacturers who act irresponsibly. So, isn't that what you want?\nCLINTON: No, that's not what I want. And that's not what the country wants. And that's not what President Obama called for. And I think he has been consistently refusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability.\nIt's the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences. You know, President Obama and I and Senator Sanders were all in the Senate at the same time. Two of us voted against what the NRA says was the most important piece of legislation in 20 years for the gun lobby. Senator Sanders voted with them, and through this morning has been unwilling to join the president and me in saying that this should be repealed. That has to be the effort that we all are behind. And he often says, well, look, I'm from Vermont and it's different. It's not like being in New York City.\nWell, in fact, the other senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, voted with President Obama and myself. So, I think that the excuses and efforts by Senator Sanders to avoid responsibility for this vote, which the NRA hailed as the most important in 20 years, points up a clear difference.\nAnd it's a difference that Democratic voters in our primary can take into account. Who is going to really stand up to the gun lobby, try to deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes 90 people's lives a day? I'm pretty clear on what I will do. And I support and will work hard to implement what the president has been advocating.\nDICKERSON: On Senator Sanders' response, this idea that he represents a state which there are lot of gun owners, you were a senator. You -- aren't you sympathetic to that? You said you represented Wall Street, and that's what shaped your views on certain Wall Street policy. And you have suggested that, as president, you would be different than you did as senator, when you were representing a state with a constituency.\nCLINTON: Well...\nDICKERSON: So, why isn't it fair for Bernie Sanders to say, as president, I would be different than I would as a senator representing a state with a lot of gun owners?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, I think you have really mixed up two important issues here.\nI have been consistent on gun lobby restrictions. In fact, I supported the Brady Bill. Senator Sanders voted against it five times. So, there is a very clear difference.\nAnd when it comes to Wall Street, yes, I represented New York. And I was proud to do so. And I took on Wall Street. I'm the person who came out against derivatives. I'm the person who came out calling for restrictions on CEO pay, which, thankfully, got into the Dodd- Frank bill.\nI'm the person who went to Wall Street and actually confronted them in 2007. I called them out on the role they were playing in the mortgage market. So, I do have a history of taking on what I consider to be the abuses that come from any industry, including Wall Street.\nAnd I will continue to do so as president. And the proposal that I have put forth about how we rein in the excesses of Wall Street, so we never again face what we did in 2008, has been judged as being more comprehensive, tougher, more effective by Barney Frank, by Sherrod Brown, my friend from Ohio who leads the banking efforts in the Senate, and by Paul Krugman. So, I have plan that will go after not just the big banks, because Dodd-Frank has given us the tools to do a lot of that, but to go after the so-called shadow banking industry.\nDICKERSON: Right.\nCLINTON: And I think I'm well-prepared. I know what needs to be done. It's kind of like Nixon going to China, John.\nDICKERSON: All right, Senator, let me ask you about a general election opponent you may face. That is Donald Trump.\nYou got into a pretty ugly exchange. You charged that he -- you charged him with sexism, and then he put out an Instagram video of your husband and Monica Lewinsky. Your reaction to that?\nCLINTON: Well, if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past, that's his prerogative. You know, so be it.\nI'm going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, which affects two-thirds of the women, who are the ones receiving the minimum wage, protecting a woman's right to make the most personal health care decisions.\nThat's why I'm so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire, because I'm going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, something that he supports.\nSo, there are very clear distinctions. He can say whatever he wants to about me. Let the voters judge that. But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made. It's been too hard-fought-for. And I'm going to stand up and make it clear there's a huge difference between us.\nDICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, what do you say, though, to those even in your own party who say that -- a discussion of that portion of your husband's career is fair game to talk about in an election?\nCLINTON: Well, it's been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years. They can do it again if they want to. That can be their choice as to how to run in this campaign. Didn't work before. It won't work again, because it is what people are focused on, not for the past, but for the future.\nWhat are we going to do to get wages rising? What are we going to do to create more good jobs? What are we going to do keep rights? What are we going to do to make sure that the Supreme Court has people on it who will defend women's rights, who will defend marriage equality, who will defend voter rights?\nSo, I can't run anybody else's campaign. They can say whatever they want. More power to them. I think it's a dead end, blind alley for them, but let them go. I'm going to talk about the differences between us, because I think that's what Americans care about. DICKERSON: Secretary Clinton, I'm afraid we're at a dead end ourselves and out of time. [laughter]\nDICKERSON: Thanks so much for being with us.\nCLINTON: Thanks. Let's continue the conversation, John.\nDICKERSON: See you out there.\n","162":"\nMATTHEWS: Thank you, Madam Secretary. This is a big interview for us. Twenty-two years we've been doing this, and this is one of our big ones. I want to tell you\u2014want to ask you about 12 questions tonight...\nCLINTON: OK.\nMATTHEWS: ... in two segments. I hope we get through them all.\nCLINTON: Thanks, Chris.\nMATTHEWS: Back in 2001, when we had 9\/11 and you were a senator from New York, there was a different spirit in this country, including the Republican Party. You had a Republican president who went on the air and made it clear time and again this is not a battle between the West and the East. It's not about Muslims. It's about terrorism. And he did it so effectively.\nAnd now we have the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president basically declaring a war on Muslims, saying they're not allowed in the country, the whole works. What do you make of this?\nCLINTON: Well, it's deeply distressing to me because I, as you know, well remember what happened after 9\/11. And I have publicly given President Bush a lot of credit for the way that he set the tone and his entire administration echoed that.\nAnd now we need to have a sense of unity and purpose in combatting terrorism. I view it as a threat. I believe ISIS cannot be contained. It has to be defeated. But in order to do that, we need to work within our own country with Muslim Americans, so that what I'm hearing from the other side, is not only offensive and shameful, it's dangerous, counterproductive. And of course, we have to work with countries around the world in order to have a unified coalition against terrorism.\nAnd I've laid out very clearly what I think needs to be done, and it does include an American-led air alliance, and we're doing that. And we're supporting troops on the ground that are not Americans, special forces, but we do need to have the Kurds and the Arabs with special forces support, but not American combat troops.\nAnd we need to go after the arc of instability that fuels this terrorist ideology from North Africa to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and go after their funding and their foreign fighters and their very effective use of the Internet.\nBut then the third pillar of my approach is we have to be safe here at home. We have to work with our friends and allies around the world. And I know you just got back from Israel. We have a lot of important work to do with countries from one end of the globe to the other. And we need to do it in alliance with Muslims here in America and elsewhere. And that's what I'm advocating.\nMATTHEWS: That's why I'm concerned about the Republican Party because this ethnic way of going at this situation, the way they seem to be going at the Muslim people, rather than the terrorists\u2014this started\u2014remember when the man whose name we dare not speak anymore, Donald Trump\u2014I mean, the fact is, Trump started his sort of initiation in politics by saying the president of the United States was an illegal immigrant, he was probably a Muslim, he had a\u2014he almost was an identity thief who created a notion of himself through a phony birth certificate, a phony birth announcement, and he was somehow\u2014in fact, he used to say things\u2014Trump would say things like, Nobody knew him in school, like he's some phantom impersonator, usurper.\nThe Republican Party, every time he did that, said nothing.\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: Boehner, the speaker of the House, who was pretty much respected, wouldn't\u2014isn't this a Republican Party problem, that started with Trump's first arrival on the world stage as some sort of politician, that it's ethnic with them? The president of the United States is one of the bad guys, one of the\u2014if not the terrorists, one of the sneaker-in-ers who snuck into the country and assumed an identity. It's pretty sick.\nCLINTON: Well, it's very divisive and I think counterproductive. It undermines our values, who we are as a people. We are a nation of immigrants, which you know so well. And when I hear what's coming from the other side\u2014and it's not just one person. There's an echo chamber there. And it's very troubling to me to try to divide and conquer, divide and conquer, and you know, a house divided against itself cannot stand.\nWe need to be united. And we should not reward people who use inflammatory rhetoric, who use the kind of derogatory comments, whether it's about Muslims or Mexicans or women or people with disabilities, whoever it might be. That is not a sign of leadership. That's a sign of, you know, showmanship, of desperation that should be rejected roundly by the American people.\nMATTHEWS: By the way, you know, my grandmother spoke Irish when I grew up. I had an Irish accent in the house.\nCLINTON: Yes?\nMATTHEWS: Let me ask you about guns...\nCLINTON: I would have guessed that.\nMATTHEWS: Yes. Well, let's talk about guns because you've shown a lot of guts out there. And we know all the politics of guns. You know it. You ran with your husband. You ran before for president.\nThere are states that have a real gun culture, including the state I grew up in, Pennsylvania. And you come from that part of the world, in a way. And you do come from [inaudible] Scranton...\nCLINTON: My father comes from, right.\nMATTHEWS: So you know there's a gun culture. How do you deal with that in Electoral College situations, where you've got to beat a Republican come next November, hopefully, for you? How do you\u2014how do you make sure that the gun people don't emotionally say, Oh, she's an enemy of guns?\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's important to be focused on what we can do together, and that's why I do support comprehensive background checks and to close the gun show loophole and the on-line loophole and what's called the Charleston loophole...\nMATTHEWS: Right.\nCLINTON: ... and to prevent people who are on the no-fly list from getting guns. And in fact, what I am proposing is supported by a great majority of the American people and a significant majority of gun owners.\nJust today at Osage\u2014you were here when I was speaking to the crowd\u2014and then afterwards, I always take time so people can come up to me. Sometimes I do it publicly, a lot of times I do it privately, what's on their minds.\nAnd a man came up. He had a veterans cap on. And he said, you know, I'm a gun owner, he said, but I don't see any reason why we can't do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: And he asked me, What can I do? I said, Well, please stand up against the NRA and the gun lobby. And please talk to your friends because what we are proposing is consistent with constitutional rights.\nBut I agree with you, Chris, it's going to be part of the\u2014you know, the political debate, and frankly, the battle in a lot of parts of our country going forward.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: But it is so important, when we lose 90 people a day, 33,000 Americans every year, and when you have met as many victims of gun violence as I have, when you've sat there and you've listened to their stories about losing a child, losing a husband, losing a parent\u2014and I've met with the mothers who have lost children to gun violence by police hands, by, you know, more likely, gun and gang\u2014deadly combination. I've just so many people, from Columbine to Sandy Hook.\nI just can't remain silent. And I think we are at a turning point. And what I said to the man here is, you know, There needs to be a rival organization to the NRA of responsible gun owners, who know that their hunting rights...\nMATTHEWS: Moms Demand Action.\nCLINTON: ... their collecting rights, all of that is not going to be affected. So I'm going to keep beating the drum, and I'm delighted that the president announced the actions he did today.\nMATTHEWS: Well, you're back in this fight.\nCLINTON: I am.\nMATTHEWS: You know, you were here eight years ago. Here you are again.\nCLINTON: I am. I am.\nMATTHEWS: And I do wonder sometimes at you sometimes, your ability\u2014your... [laughter]\nTo use the word \"stamina,\" that hasn't been used correctly lately. You know, I'm a student of history, like you are, and I remember Nixon back in 1950 ran against Helen Gehagen Douglas. And she was one of the first women, liberal, to go out there...\nCLINTON: She is.\nMATTHEWS: ... progressives, to try to win a big seat.\nRight.\nAnd he used to\u2014he said things like, You know, it's awfully hard on a woman. [laughter] He used these little shots at her.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nMATTHEWS: Here we are, two thirds of a century later...\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: ... and the leading Republican candidate is out saying that you don't have the stamina, the strength\u2014is this sexism? Is it what it is?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, I have a new year's resolution...\nMATTHEWS: I know. I've heard this... [crosstalk]\nCLINTON: I will not respond to his, you know...\nMATTHEWS: What does it say about the Republican...\nCLINTON: ... personal attacks.\nMATTHEWS: Well, let me try to phrase it\u2014I feel like a lawyer now. How do I rephrase? [laughter]\nHow does the Republican Party deal with the fact they're voting for this guy, that 35 percent of people are supporting him, and even though he's making these charges, which a lot of people would say are\u2014why would he go after your stamina, rather than Bill's stamina or George McGovern's stamina or anybody else's, except you're a woman?\nCLINTON: Well, look...\nMATTHEWS: He's older than you.\nCLINTON: That's true.\nMATTHEWS: I'm older than you.\nCLINTON: That's true!\nMATTHEWS: My stamina's all right.\nCLINTON: That's true.\nMATTHEWS: So why is he doing this?\nCLINTON: Well, why does he do whatever he does? I can only tell you what I hear from people, and what I hear from people is really about their lives and their future. I mean, lot of this back and forth that goes on...\nMATTHEWS: I know, but...\nCLINTON: ... in the political...\nMATTHEWS: ... he's winning.\nCLINTON: ... universe\u2014well, we'll see. We'll see. We haven't had a single caucus. We haven't had a single primary. The Republicans will have to choose whoever they decide to be their nominee, and I'm looking forward, if I am so fortunate to be the nominee, to run against whoever they put up.\nI'm just going to keep working really hard, like right out there today, you know, getting people to caucus for me, connecting them up with my great organizers. I have an amazing team here...\nMATTHEWS: OK...\nCLINTON: ... and we're just going to work as hard as we can to make my case.\nMATTHEWS: He ain't going to stop. He did an interview with my colleague, Joe Scarborough, this morning. It's going to air tomorrow morning. He's out there again saying he's going after your family. He said it's fair to go after them.\nCLINTON: Well, I just...\nMATTHEWS: He's just going to keep doing it.\nCLINTON: Well...\nMATTHEWS: He says you're an enabler. He's making it personal with you.\nCLINTON: Well, he can say whatever he wants to say. I'm going to keep talking about what people talk to me about...\nMATTHEWS: OK.\nCLINTON: ... and what they talk to me about is, What will you do about prescription drug prices?\nMATTHEWS: By the way, you're good on that one. That's so true.\nCLINTON: Well, it's unbelievable what's happening to people!\nMATTHEWS: Everybody's taking drugs now, and you need\u2014if you have diabetes, like me, or somebody, everybody needs it\u2014if your parents died of Alzheimer's\u2014you talked about that out here.\nCLINTON: Yes.\nMATTHEWS: These are real things.\nCLINTON: These are real things that people talk to me about.\nMATTHEWS: OK...\nCLINTON: And I'm going to be a president who does the big stuff that gets in the headlines, that, you know, you and other analysts and reporters talk about, and I'm going to do the stuff that keeps people awake at night...\nMATTHEWS: OK...\nCLINTON: ... like, you know, making sure they can afford their prescription drugs.\nMATTHEWS: I want to say something nice about you.\nCLINTON: Oh, please! [laughter]\nMATTHEWS: No, I have to. I'm personally responsible. Back when you had all the difficulty in the second administration of President Clinton, your husband, and you had a difficult situation you had to go through\u2014and you went through it, and I think you were completely stunned by it initially, and then you had to deal with it as you became aware of what was going on.\nAnd what did you do? You didn't cry. You didn't go away and say, Gee, whiz, this is terrible, why am I going through this? What you did is you went out and you acted like a champion for Democrats. You went around the country campaigning like mad. You were the real banner carrier for the Democratic Party in '98.\nAnd something interesting happened. An epiphany happened. Somehow, out there campaigning in New York for Chuck Schumer and other people, you said something to yourself. You said, You know what? Something good can come out of this for me. I can become a hero to people.\nAnd you ran for the Senate from New York, when a lot of people were critics of you, would have loved you to have fallen on your face. They would have eaten it up if you'd gone down in a ditch up in New York and lost\u2014because at the time, you were running against Rudy...\nCLINTON: That's right.\nMATTHEWS: ... who looked unbeatable.\nCLINTON: That's right.\nMATTHEWS: And you had the guts to go out there. What made you do it? Because there's a lot of women watching right now. Half my viewers are women. And they want to hear what's it take for a woman to just rise out of a situation which is pretty bad and come out of it and say, You know what? I can rise to this occasion. How did you do it?\nCLINTON: Well, you know, that's a great question because I...\nMATTHEWS: Do you know the answer?\nCLINTON: I didn't have any sense that all of this would happen. I really didn't.\nMATTHEWS: Well, New York came and fell in love with you and said, We like you.\nCLINTON: And\u2014and...\nMATTHEWS: Come up here, live up here, be our senator.\nCLINTON: They did, and Please run. And I said, no, no, no. I said no, no...\nMATTHEWS: Charlie Rangel...[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: Yes, and so many others. And I absolutely said no. And I'll tell you what changed my mind, and it was maybe something that other women can relate to because I was in the news, like, Would she or wouldn't she, and I kept saying, I'm not going to. And I was first lady going up to do an event in New York City to promote women in athletics, and Billie Jean King and great athletes were there.\nMATTHEWS: She's great.\nCLINTON: And so I was introduced by this young woman. I think she was, like, the volleyball or basketball captain. And I came up and shook her hand, and you know, I said, Great job. She leaned over to me and she said, Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton, dare to compete.\nAnd I thought, Wow. You know, I have encouraged so many women and girls to compete on the athletic fields, in academics...\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: ... in politics, in business, and I'm being asked to compete. And it...\nMATTHEWS: And stick your neck out.\nCLINTON: And stick my neck out. And it is scary! It is.\nMATTHEWS: It's different than supporting your spouse, isn't it.\nCLINTON: Totally different. ?I mean, I had the hardest time when I started saying, I am me. I'm happy to say, you know, my husband this, or candidate X or Y, but to stand up there and be the person out there...\nMATTHEWS: Wow.\nCLINTON: And it is a big challenge. And I think because, you know, we're coming into our own as women in all walks of life, but still, there's something a little bit daunting about...\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: ... holding yourself out, asking people to support you, to give you money, to vote for you. It's hard.\nMATTHEWS: And you know who went through that? Another New York senator, Bobby Kennedy.\nCLINTON: Yes.\n[crosstalk]\nMATTHEWS: ... his brother's brother.\nCLINTON: I remember reading about that.\nMATTHEWS: And then all of a sudden, he had to be the guy and stuck his neck out.\nAnyway, we're going to come back and talk about...\nCLINTON: OK.\nMATTHEWS: ... you because I\u2014the way I look at politics\u2014and you called me an analyst. I like that. I'm an analyst. And I look at this race for president, 2016, which we're now in, and really, that list is closing. And a guy at Georgetown, a professor, once said, there's a difference between free will and free choice. Free choice means there's a limit number of choices. And it looks like there's a limited number of choices for the president of the United States coming in 2016, and you're one of them.\nWe'll be right back and talk about Hillary Clinton as the possibly the next\u2014in fact, the first-ever woman commander-in-chief of the United States.\n[commercial break]\nMATTHEWS: Madam Secretary, you may have a new title if this campaign is successful. You have to win the primary. You got to beat Bernie. You got to beat Martin O'Malley. But if all that happens, then you have to beat whoever on the Republican side, you could be the first woman commander-in-chief.\nAnd this is all happening, perhaps coincidentally, or maybe culturally, when Ashton Carter, the secretary of defense, has just made it clear now that all combat roles are open to women. This is something unique in our history. Now, maybe every woman doesn't want these jobs.\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: But these jobs are now open. You can go out there and be infantry. You can go out there, you know, with a knife in your teeth and you can go swinging on ropes into whatever valley you got to go kill people in. Women are going to be doing that, just like in Israel, where I just was.\nHow's our country going to adapt to that? And is it important culturally for us to have women in this combat role?\nCLINTON: I think it's important to open up all roles to women, but I also agree with Secretary Carter that you have to have standards. And women and men have to meet those standards because we're talking literally life or death. So I am...\nMATTHEWS: You mean like climbing ropes and things like that.\nCLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. And how much weight you can carry because maybe one of your, you know, fellow soldiers will need that one day. And so I am a huge supporter of women being able to break whatever glass ceilings are holding them back...\nMATTHEWS: If they can physically handle it.\nCLINTON: They've got to be able\u2014and mentally.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: You know, it\u2014physically, mentally, you have to be prepared. You have to be ready. And I think that you're right, not every woman's going to want to do that, and some of the women who want to do it are not going to qualify.\nBut we just had a few women pass Ranger school, which is an enormously...\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: ... competitive, grueling experience. It was just less than a handful, but they proved they could do it. And from everything I know, nobody cut any slack for them. They did it.\nAnd in fact, after it was over, they interviewed some of the, you know, male competitors...\nMATTHEWS: Right.\nCLINTON: ... to go through Ranger school, and these guys said, You know, after a while, I didn't even notice. I mean, yes, you're right, she was a woman. She carried her weight. She pulled her own.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: That's what you want because I think about the job that I'm applying for, and it really is a job interview that I'm doing all over America.\nMATTHEWS: Commander-in-chief.\nCLINTON: President and commander-in-chief. And I feel ready to fulfill both roles. I think it's important that the next president get the economy working for everybody so that we don't keep having the deck stacked for those on the top. We've got to stay safe at home and strong in the world. And we've got to deal with these problems that keep people up at night, I like to say.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: I feel particularly well prepared to do every part of the job. And when it comes to being commander-in-chief, my eight years as a senator from New York after 9\/11, my four years as secretary of state, my many, many hours in the Situation Room, I know how hard these choices are.\nMATTHEWS: You were there when Osama was killed.\nCLINTON: I was. You know, I was one of the very few people that was brought in to advise the president.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: And it was the most...\nMATTHEWS: You said, Go for it.\nCLINTON: I did. I did, you know, after, as I say, sitting through hours of meetings, listening to the intelligence being presented, listening to Admiral McRaven, who was then the head of special forces, talk about, you know, what special forces could do, looking at other options...\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: ... like a cruise missile or a Predator\u2014armed predator, and recommending to the president that we go with the Navy SEAL option, and then being there that day, watching part of the operation on a video screen in the Situation Room, just holding my breath literally through the whole thing.\nI know how hard these choices are. And I know what a cool, deliberative head needs to be finally making them.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: I have learned so much, Chris, over the last years. I feel very ready.\nMATTHEWS: You have the\u2014you know who said you had the temperament for it? Bill Clinton, which I thought was interesting, because he would know your temperament.\nCLINTON: Yes. Yes.\nMATTHEWS: Let me ask about your sort of position on this. You voted for the Iraq War authorization, if not the war.\nBernie Sanders is out there still hitting you on that one. Of course, he's coming from the left on you. You have got Rand Paul out there, who is a libertarian and a bit of a\u2014I would say a bit of a dove, saying that you would be more for regime change, that you would start the next war.\nCLINTON: Yes. Well, he's wrong. He is wrong.\nMATTHEWS: They're positioning you as to the hawkish side of Obama.\nCLINTON: Yes. Right.\nMATTHEWS: How\u2014where would you\u2014you read Fred Hiatt of \"The Washington Post\" the other day...\nCLINTON: Yes.\nMATTHEWS: ... position you as someone, I thought, a notch to the hawkish side, because he said you were for a no-fly zone in Syria. You were for ground troops, but not necessarily our troops, but some...\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: Because you need a ground component to tell the bombs where to\u2014to tell them where to drop the bombs.\nCLINTON: Right. Exactly. Right.\nMATTHEWS: Does that make you more hawkish than the president?\nCLINTON: Well, I think most of what I have been advocating, the president is now doing.\nMATTHEWS: But not that.\nCLINTON: Well, we have special forces on the ground. He sent them.\nMATTHEWS: But no-fly zone?\nCLINTON: But the no-fly zone, for me, was an idea that I developed with some advisers.\nMATTHEWS: Is it dangerous with the Russians flying around there?\nCLINTON: Well, of course you would have to have the Russians to sign off on it.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: And we were making progress.\nI don't know what the result will be of the conflict now between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But, you know, for the last four years, we have been pushing to try to get a peace conference going.\nAnd I give Secretary Kerry credit for getting everybody agreeing to be in the same room. I saw the no-fly zone as leverage. Number one, if we could get the Russians on board, because we would have to\u2014and I think we could, if we were to say, look, we need safe zones. If we're going to be operating on the ground, advising the Kurds, the Arabs, we need safe zones.\nWe also need safe places for civilians, so that they're not refugees leaving Iraq and Syria. And it can be done. It can be done in a way that doesn't create more problems.\nBut now I'm\u2014I'm very supportive of what the president's doing. We're making some progress. And I have been calling for that, calling for reconstituting the approach toward the sheiks, the Sunni sheiks in Anbar Province, getting them back into the fight, so to speak.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: They are. Rebuilding the Iraqi army.\nMATTHEWS: Yes. That's what we need.\nCLINTON: We need that.\nMATTHEWS: We need the Sunnis to retake their land, because the Shia can't do it.\nCLINTON: We need the\u2014well, the still largely Shia Iraqi army took Ramadi, but with Sunni troops.\nMATTHEWS: Army. They have to turn it over to Sunnis.\nCLINTON: And then turn it over.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: This makes all the sense in the world to me.\nSo, I view myself as being a realist, being practical, and in accordance with our values, because I think it's very important that we get back to promoting our values and pursuing our interests and protecting our security.\nIf the United States doesn't do that on our own behalf or on behalf of our friends in Europe and Asia and the Middle East, no one will. So this is not a choice. It's not a luxury. It's a necessity.\nMATTHEWS: OK. Last question. We're running out of time.\nI want to try to help you for this audience tonight, our audience, locate yourself politically in this country. [laughter]\nNow, we have Trump out there and we have Bernie out here.\nNow, Bernie calls himself a socialist. Nobody uses a derogatory term anymore. It's\u2014he loves to have that label. He's never ran as a Democrat. He runs against Democrats up there in Vermont.\nYou're a Democrat. I would say you're a pretty typical Democrat in the tradition of the Democratic Party, and Humphrey, the rest of them, Scoop\u2014not even Scoop. I would say Mondale. You're somewhere in there.\nWhat's the difference between a socialist and a Democrat?\nCLINTON: Well, you have to...\nMATTHEWS: Is that a question you want to answer, or would you rather not?\n[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: Well, you would have to ask...\n[crosstalk]\nMATTHEWS: Well, see, I'm asking you. You're a Democrat. He's a socialist. Would you like somebody to call you a socialist? I wouldn't like somebody calling me a socialist.\nCLINTON: Well, but I'm not one. I'm not one.\nMATTHEWS: OK. Well, what's the difference between a socialist and a Democrat? Last question.\nCLINTON: Well, I can tell you what I am.\nI am a progressive Democrat. I am a progressive Democrat...\nMATTHEWS: How is that different than a socialist?\nCLINTON: ... who likes to get things done and who believes that we're better off in this country when we're trying to solve problems together, getting people to work together.\nThere will always be strong feelings, and I respect that, from, you know, the far right, the far left, libertarians, whatever\u2014whoever it might be. We need to get people working together. We have got to get the economy fixed. We have got to get all of our problems, you know, really tackled. And that's what I want to do.\nMATTHEWS: I know.\nYes, I think the difference is\u2014and Debbie Wasserman Schultz wouldn't answer the question either I asked her, because I know, politically, you have to keep together. The center-left and the left has to work together. I know all that.\nLet me ask you about working together. You gave a nice speech here today in Osage about the need to work\u2014I wrote a book about Tip and Reagan. When it comes to an urgent issue, they can find a solution.\nCLINTON: Right.\nMATTHEWS: Obama\u2014I have always supported the president on his philosophy, on his general approach to a lot of things.\nBut he doesn't seem to like the company of fellow politicians. He just doesn't. He doesn't want to hang out with them, play cards with them at midnight. Maybe he did it in Springfield. For some reason, he doesn't want to do it in Washington.\nYou seem to like the company of people like Lindsey Graham and John McCain. And you can find a way, go on CODELs with them and getting along with them. And it seems to me that is an important part of life, that you have to find\u2014you were talking about Tom DeLay here.\nAnd I get along with Tom DeLay. Even though you disagree 180 on something, you have got to find\u2014Congress means coming together.\nCLINTON: Yes. Well, your book is a perfect example of...\nMATTHEWS: \"Tip and the Gipper.\"\nCLINTON: Exactly. And, look, there may be...\nMATTHEWS: You read it?\nCLINTON: I did.\nMATTHEWS: Thank you.\nCLINTON: I don't\u2014I don't want you to know that, but I did.\nMATTHEWS: But you have just told me that. I like this. You're throwing me an encomium here. [laughter]\nCLINTON: No, because I\u2014because I am always looking for ways that we work together.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: And it used to be easier in the past.\nMATTHEWS: It did.\nCLINTON: I think that the polarization has gotten so acute now, and so you have to work even harder. But relationships are the beginning of everything.\nMATTHEWS: So, you could imagine, if you're fortunate to become the next president of the United States, having people over to the White House, not going to the Jefferson Hotel for an hour-and-a-half, but actually having people come over and talk it over?\nCLINTON: Yes, well...\nMATTHEWS: By the way, you're an empty nester, so it's easier for you.\nCLINTON: It is easier.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: It is much easier.\nAnd, look, everybody has strengths that they bring to this position. And, obviously...\nMATTHEWS: Is schmoozing one of yours?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that I like it, because I am looking for that common ground somewhere.\nMATTHEWS: Yes. Yes.\nCLINTON: And I don't think that you get it just on the first try.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: You have got to listen to people. You got to get to know people. You got to look for ways that you can reach across the aisle.\nMATTHEWS: Yes.\nCLINTON: I'm not saying it's going to be magic, because part of what's happened\u2014and it is different from when Tip O'Neill and President Reagan were working together\u2014it is so much more gerrymandered. It's so much more influenced...\nMATTHEWS: I know. You don't have any Republicans in a Democratic district.\nCLINTON: Not anymore.\nMATTHEWS: You don't have any Democrats in a Republican district.\nCLINTON: And so people don't feel like they have to make deals.\nMATTHEWS: OK. I have been telling people for years that, when they're with you personally, you're very different and you're very easy to talk to. [laughter]\nI think, watching you the last 20 minutes, they get the point.\nCLINTON: Thank you.\nMATTHEWS: I think this has been a great interview. And I appreciate you for coming on and giving us the time.\nCLINTON: Thank you very much, Chris. Great to see you.\nMATTHEWS: Thank you, Madam Secretary.\n"}}
