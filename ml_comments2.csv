68,b8hvxj,"I agree, I think if it is Trump v Biden, we get four more years of Trump. Unfortunately, I don't think the DNC learned their lesson from 2016, and they are going to force a Biden ticket with superdelegates, probably with Mayor Pete or Beta as VP, and Trump is going to win."
69,b8hvxj,"so if it was trump v biden but biden raped 85 people and killed a man, you’d still vote for biden? 

That’s a little fucked up, not gonna lie."
70,b8hvxj,I wouldn't be surprised to see a Biden/Beto ticket.
71,b8hvxj,"It doesn't matter what the DNC does at this point.  The people who hated trump in the beginning are still going to vote DNC. Blacks still think Trump is a big time racist, and really nothing is gonna change their minds.    

Look at all the blacks who voted for a racist Democrat Ralph Northam or at least a former racist in Virginia who got caught with a KKK costume under his name in the year book and said ""that's not me""  .    People will vote for a racist because they are sooooo blind.    They have zero clue how corrupt the party they are voting for really is.   

People will vote for corrupt politicians because they somehow feel the other party is more corrupt when in fact, they are both corrupt.    

This is why nothing really gets done in this country because people have no idea how... their country really works.

The clear cut best way to put turmoil to corruption in both these parties is to vote independent. Keep voting independent until they start to fill up seats one by one.

People have the same piss poor excuse for this. ""They will never win"" 

Well if you believe that, and you don't vote for them...well of course they aren't going to win.  

This is equivalent to saying ""ahh I'm not ever gonna start my own business because I know I will fail"".     Of course you will fail, you didn't even try. 

I used to think the same thing, when I was 19.  However I stuck to my guns and kept voting independent because I said to myself, as long as I stick to it, eventually people will start doing exactly what I'm doing one by one. Even if it takes 100 years (if we survive that long)...it's going to happen.    We have to start somewhere.  

We can't start from the top and work our way up."

75,b8hvxj,Are the Dems allowed to put two white guys on the ticket anymore?
76,b8hvxj,">	unless dems decide to put someone against Trump who isn’t so far left that it’ll turn our country into Venezuela

That will not happen this time and probably won’t in 2024 either. Biden is the token candidate like Clinton was last time and the only way he doesn’t win the primary is if he does something so unforgivable that even Obama condemns him. Or he dies, which is unlikely by next year. Even his kiddy sniffing and groping videos aren’t enough to write him off, apparently. The only person I can think of who fits your description is Tulsi Gabbard but you should see the way the left treats her. They talk about her as if she skins people alive for sport, it’s unreal.

Yang is close but his UBI ideas are yet another heavy-handed, government-dependent top down answer to a set of problems way too complex and nuanced that a “free” monthly paycheck could address. In fact, I firmly believe it would cause more problems than it would solve. And besides, once you open that Pandora’s Box, the *only* way to get elected from there on out is to continually promise people more “free” money and continue ignoring the “is this affordable and working” question.

The left is eating itself. Something like 20% of Bernie fans won’t vote for anyone else if he loses the primary, or may even give Trump the spite vote. How many of them are calling for the end of the Electoral College so far? They lost, still can’t cope with it, and now they want to change the rules. These past two years have been the most pathetic display of poor sportsmanship that I’ve seen in my entire life. And don’t even get me started on the influx of identitarian leftists like AOC who are accelerating this disintegration of the Democrat party from within."
77,b8hvxj,"> Venezuela

for the record...venezuela has a ton of problems outside being socialist. how you people can't see that is mind boggling. 

They're sitting on the biggest oil reserve. a lot of fucked up shit is happening there by powerful countries trying to sway the outcome. blaming it on one ideology (an ideology i don't agree with) is fucking stupid."

Sounds like you're a ""Bernie-Boy""? Communism is not coming to the USA any time soon. But please...go out and argue with your own base. Show your anger and desperation loudly and boldly. Tell off all those nasty faux-Democrats who don't want a 95% tax rate. Then...

Enjoy the election... ;)"
91,fe1kei,"Are you serious? Because, if so, this post is totally absurd. The Democratic Party represents different views, and that includes those who don't support ""Medicare for All, Tuition Free Schooling, $15 minimum wage and paid leave for new mothers"" to varying degrees."
92,fe1kei,We are the middle...the left and right have become cults worshippers of men...not the job or what they can accomplish....electing a man who cannot bring people together....pitting the rabid trump humpers against the Bernie worshippers for four years is not the way I want to live...it will be a war of cults....we need the middle to get anything done...it won't be what either sides want but it's chipping away at it....if you don't like that ...work n electing progressive congressman
93,fe1kei,"I disagree, and I frankly think that your view is not only logically ridiculous, it's also self defeating because it is likely to prevent the things that you want to see enacted from ever being enacted.  And, it's offensive and exclusionary.  You're basically saying that people who don't agree with you on everything can't be in your party.

I support Medicare for all, and paid leave for new mothers.  I don't know enough about how Tuition Free School would impact the overall economy, so I don't have a strong position on that except to say that I have 3 children who will be attending college (I hope) in the next 10 years, and I would love for their schooling to be free, as I don't want them to start their adult lives in debt.  I absolutely do not support a $15 minimum wage, and if you were an employer of \~300 people and struggling to make payroll each week (like I am), you wouldn't support it either.  We've had to shorten our operating hours and cut payroll as a result of the $11/hour minimum wage.  $15 would prevent me from being solvent.  I don't think you understand what a $15 minimum wage does to a business who has employees who make from minimum wage up to six figures.  When a $15 minimum wage is enacted, what do you think happens to the people who are currently making $15/hour? Do you think they're happy being among the lowest paid employees?  Of course not, they demand a raise too.  And now that the $15/hour employee is making $18/hour, what do you think the $18/hour employee wants?  The result of increasing the minimum wage is that every single person in the organization will also demand a raise.  We've done the math -- if/when minimum wage goes to $15, greater than every cent of my profit plus my salary will be take up by the extra payroll costs.

But, I'm pro-choice, pro separation of church and state, pro strong social safety network, pro social programs, pro LGBTQIA+ rights, pro equality,  pro net neutrality, pro-environment, and against silly tax cuts that only benefit the rich.  Anything else you'd like to know?

I've already been banned from /r/conservative for pointing our that the current Republicans in Washington don't really support traditionally conservative positions.  If you want to ban me from being a Democrat because I don't support the $15 minimum wage, just let me know, and I promise I won't vote for democrats anymore."
94,fe1kei,"Democrats could win, if they vote. Poor people have barriers to voting. If Democrats are the party of poor progressives, then we will never win."
95,fe1kei,damn right!!!
96,fe1kei,Aren’t this like all of Biden’s policies tho
97,fe1kei,Ummm.. actually you are mistaken.. what you are describing is being a socialist not a democrat.
98,fe1kei,"You dont have to be a Republican to understand $15 minimum wage is stupid. And if you truly believe you can't make it off of minimum wage, you have never been put in that boat. It's also probable that your job history is not working in your favor. There are people who bust their asses day in and day out for $15 an hour, and this type of comment suggests a job with the minimum requirement to work there is you being old enough deserves the same pay out as someone like a CNA, Firefighter, or even truck driver."
99,fe1kei,"Yeah, the conspiracy theorist in me things ""Moderate"" Democrats are just here to further fragment the vote and making sure no progressive ideals ever have enough momentum. ""Moderate"" Democrats like to brag about how Hilary won the popular in vote in 2016 but if you ask ""Moderate"" Democrats about getting rid of delegates they'll look at you like you have two heads. PICK A LANE."
100,fe1kei,Maybe I should not have worn my halloween mask to vote
101,fe1kei,"> Italy is proof Bernie Sanders is crazy about healthcare

Please explain."
102,fe1kei,"1. I don't know what a ""Bernie-Boy"" is but how about you get out of your bubble and try having an actual conversation with people that might hold different views than your own.

2. There will always be people debating within parties their respective parties. Currently the more progressive wing of the Democratic party is trying to push the party towards decisions and candidates that would arguably bring us up to speed with the rest of modern world when it comes to education and healthcare for example. 

3. I agree Communism is not coming to the USA. I do hope Democratic Socialism is something America will still consider given how little our social safety nets have done to help during the current pandemic.

Here is a link to Bernie Sanders website: 

Link: https://berniesanders.com/issues/

There's a Read More option which explain in detail how Bernie plans to pay for everything."
103,fe1kei,What’s the point of being a Democrat? Why not just be a Republican?
104,fe1kei,"""How is it that Dem leaders can muster the strategy , speed, and and determination to oppose a progressive grassroots. movment...but are utterly inept confronting GOP authoritarianism"" - Peter Daou"
105,fe1kei,""" In my Inaugural I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country. It seems to me to be equally plain that **no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue** in this country. By ""business"" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living. ""   - Franklin D. Roosevelt"
106,fe1kei,"Whoa whoa whoa first off I think I totally came off to harshly. It’s totally ok too disagree and I don’t want you to feel like you don’t belong in the party. You have a right to it just as much as everyone else here. I think agreeing on most things is perfectly ok. I just think to be a Democrat you should at least believe in SOME OF THOSE IDEALS and I don’t mean some half ass Medicare for all who want it crap. Secondly, congrats on your families success and I hope all your children graduate debt free.

The people in the party (not the voters but the people in charge) have at best questionable views and progressive ideas. I don’t own a business so I would default to you in terms of what is and is not feasible but there’s a difference between not being able to make pay roll and not being able to afford your 8th house. We as a nation should work to make sure people like you (job creaters) are given all the help they need to continue what you’re doing BUT that doesn’t mean people don’t deserve a living wage which is not $11/hr. I was lucky enough to be in an industry with very high demand and I work very hard to keep myself competitive. I pulled the fuck out of my bootstraps but I can’t help realizing that not everyone is lucky enough to be given opportunities (earned or otherwise). Rising out of poverty is hard.

Lastly, totally didn’t mean to pick a fight with fellow Democrats but if you don’t believe in one of these 

 - Medicare For All
- Holiday for voting for our president 
 - Tuition Free Education 
 - Increasing the minimum wage
 - Paid time off for mothers
 - Man made climate change 
 - Stopping the for profit prison system that are literally allowed to sue a fucking state if they don’t have enough prisoners

Are you even a Democrat? What does a Democrat even mean if you don’t believe in progressive ideals that help the most amount of people. I could go on but it sounds like we agree on a lot of things but if the people at the top of the Democratic Party aren’t willing to take strong stances FOR* these important issues then what the fuck is even a Democrat?"
107,fe1kei,"No they can't.  Look at the comments directed at me in this thread -- it deems like vociferous Democrats are hell bent on not only being the party of poor progressives, but also on being the party that actively excludes progressives who aren't poor.  Very sad."
108,fe1kei,I’m SO UPSET at the apathy from young people. It’s hard for poor people to vote but I do early voting and they just mail me my ballot. I’m not sure why everyone can’t do that? I’m not being sarcastic I actually don’t know. Either way. Why aren’t Democrats pushing for a voting holiday?
109,fe1kei,They are not
110,fe1kei,Nope. :)
111,fe1kei,How so?
112,fe1kei,"But see, they're *actually going to vote Democrat*, so they're not going to ""fragment the vote"" necessarily. They're new democrats: it's like getting out of an abusive relationship.

There are also people like me who are kind of identity voters? Like, I vote Dem no matter who. I voted Bernie, but I don't care."
113,fe1kei,"Huh...its this sort of nonsense that moved me to the right. Progressives want all their demands met right friggin' now, or their gonna scream obscenities at everyone.

So I did PICK A LANE...and I blame reactionary, spoiled little brats for destroying real Liberalism."
114,fe1kei,"Government healthcare single-payer, they have one of the worst healthcare systems in the world"
115,fe1kei,"I have little to no interest in Bernie's website. I've been listening to his haranguing for a long time now. He has adopted 2 major problems now...I mean aside from the lack of posture and hair style...

1. Open borders policy.

2. The Green New Deal.

Between them, a semi-believable idea...becomes a tax burden and devaluation of the Dollar, that nobody wants. Not even you.

Progressivism has hi-jacked the Liberal agenda. A very loud and self-entitled minority, who want their playstation, and want it right gawd-damn now! Do you know how long it took many of these ""rest of the modern world"" countries to implement universal healthcare?

Progressives are...in short...what's really wrong with the Democratic Party. That and the TDS thing...And afterall, that's really what this sub is about...isn't it."
116,fe1kei,"Are you being obtuse on purpose?  The Democratic Party can and should include people  who agree on even one of those issues, but youre attempting to exclude people who don't agree with you on all of these issues.  You're the reason we have a dimwit as Trump as president. Congrats."
117,fe1kei,Also this.
118,fe1kei,"Unfortunately, I’m in retail, margins are thin, and competition is fierce.  

By your measure, what’s my choice? Continue to run a losing business? Or should I close my doors, lay everyone off, and go back to my professional job, where i made a good living but employed no one? You act like I’m paying myself millions while squeezing my employees. This is far from the truth.  I’m struggling too. 

This reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend once, who was lauding my state’s efforts to reduce cigarette smoking by raising taxes on cigarettes. He seems to agree whole-heartedly with the proposition that artificially raising the price of something will reduce consumption of it. He had no response when I mentioned to him that the same thing was true with labor - if you artificially raise the price of it, businesses will consume less. We will invest in automation and get rid of the people.  This isn’t what I want, but if it’s what you want, you’re not the good person you think you are."
119,fe1kei,"Thank you for starting this thread.  I know you mean well, but reading the comments directed at me, it's now clear to me now that the Democrats are just as bad as Republicans with their purity tests and inability to handle dissenting opinions . 

Sadly, you and like-minded people (e.g., others who have posted in this thread) are responsible for someone like Trump being elected President.  Good job."
120,fe1kei,"Other than Medicare for all, which Biden has a different plan for what isn’t"
121,fe1kei,It's not enough to just vote Democrat. Picking one choice over the other is the difference between being able to afford medication or not. Voting for a Democrat is useless if they're pulling the party towards more conservative ideals.
122,fe1kei,Europe has had a National Health Care Service since the 1970s. Don't you think it's time we kind of got on board? It's been 30+ years. When will enough time have passed before it's ok for us to ask for a national healthcare system?
123,fe1kei,"Canada has a single-payer option and has 450 cases to our 5,000. They seem to be containing the virus.

So there are some countries with single-payer systems that work and some that could work better. What's your point?"
124,fe1kei,"Italy has, per capita, the highest number of elderly in the world. They were especially vulnerable to this."
125,fe1kei,"I'm confused do you think American should have a single payer system or not? 

It's not about wanting a playstation right now. It's about insuring that someone who is fired from their job still has health Insurance. 

I'm not saying I agree with everything Bernie is proposing but I think your cartoonish characterization of a portion of the party that believe healthcare should be just as much of a ""right"" as a gun is way out of left field and it would probably serve you well to drop it if you want to be taken seriously."
126,fe1kei,"Are you not answering the question on purpose? 

Here I'll say it again so it's easier for us to be on the same page. We can Disagree on some issues and that is ok (please read this twice in case you missed). Look a new sentence right here again were I state that its ok for us to disagree. Same page? Cool. Now my original point is If we disagree on ALL issues, if you don't champion ANY progressive causes than what's your plan for the party other than not wanting your taxes raised?

I don't like my views being misrepresented so I hope this helps clear up any confusion.

And again. Just for you. Loud and clear. Ready? It's ok for us to disagree. You have just as much right to the party and your views as anyone else."
127,fe1kei,"Retail has existed since at least 10,000 years ago. The minimum wage was $11.39 in 1968 adjusted for inflation and the hourly earnings in the retail trade in 1969 was $2.30.

$2.30 in 1969 is equivalent in purchasing power to about $16.17 in 2020 

How did they do it in the past? Without the benefit of computers meaning they had to employ more people at the higher wages. I suggest you figure out what they did and do that or go back to your professional job. I would suggest raising prices.

Your not struggling if you own a business that employees people. Chances are you don't know what struggling is. Do you have a mortgage? Family? Retirement savings? Well, that last one doesn't matter much for you as your business will keep generating passive income."

137,fe1kei,"You've missed economies of scale. Wal-Mart took over because they could do more with less labor. And, because we no longer needed to drive to four corners of the town to get different items to live. The time and money savings were immense.

But, that also meant that we had one business instead of four. We didn't need as many store clerks. We didn't need as much management or real estate or gas usage to drive around. The savings were passed on to the consumer and the losses accrued to labor.

Now, we have Amazon. It is even more efficient and cheaper than Wal-Mart. It uses even less labor, more automated/mechanical means of order fulfillment. Warehousing means that there's less labor overhead for the business to run. But that also pressures Wal-Mart staffing all the more.

The trajectory is toward less and less labor as it's always been a massive cost driver--typically the highest cost--of any business.

Consumers choose low cost options. The low cost option means less labor hours.

These are realities that should be understood. A lean business is one that produces at a good cost. The only other choice is to create market distortions through marketing, etc."
138,fe1kei,"My advice for you would be to try not to push away people who agree with you on 90 percent of all issues.  That seems to me to be a recipe for electoral failure.  Instead, let's cast a broad net, build a collation of people who agree with on most issues, and let's move forward."

I personally liked this article: www.axios.com/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-energy-policy-fcf879e2-c3a9-42e5-9cbf-ba15da2579cb.html

You can argue on the merits of Biden's plan, like the lower price tag, or the fact that he likely won't use executive orders like Bernie would, but net zero by 2050 is a generally accepted mark.

140,fe1kei,"EVERYONE SHOULD VOTE AND VOTING IS REALLY IMPORTANT, FULL STOP.

Apologies if that was rude. I agree we should vote. Good. Lets end that. I don't want this threat to be overrun with tangents on voting or being involved in the political process since that a tactic used by the ruling class to keep voters fighting among themselves as oppose to talking about the actual issue.

The point I'm making is that the Democratic party has been overrun by fake Democrats that don't appear to champion progressive ideals. Both Republicans AND ""Moderate"" Democrats don't believe in even basic progressive ideals like a representational Democracy (Electoral College and Delegates) where every vote is counted and weighted the same. The only difference between a ""Moderate"" Democrat and a Republican is wether or not they hate minorities. That's why the Democratic party/establishment aren't giving voters anything to vote FOR. Because there is no difference. Their whole messaging boils down to ""vote for us or else Trump"". That's how you get another 4 years of President 4chan."
141,fe1kei,"I understand being realistic but I'm asking how long until American catches up to the modern world? Again, Americans has seen 30 years of this system already."
142,fe1kei,"Yes, but here's the thing though. Biden is going back towards the Mitt Romney compromise. So the top choices are A) slightly less universal healthcare and B) a turd the claims he's for Universal Healthcare but obviously will never pass it. Where is this choice C) a compromise that goes to slightly more universal healthcare?"
143,fe1kei,Canadians love their healthcare system.
144,fe1kei,"That's a weird example. You don't know why he went to Florida and feel free to provide with a source if I'm wrong. Secondly, This is a great country to live in despite it's short comings and there are valid reasons to want to see a doctor in the US. All that being said the average person who isn't a prime minister would be served better by not having to pay premiums or 10 dollars for a bandaid. Can you see there's something broken in a system that charges people 10 dollar for a bandit? 5 Dollar for a cough drop?"
145,fe1kei,You’re right I don’t have to take you seriously.
146,fe1kei,"The question only applies if you don't like ANY of these ideas:

- Medicare For All
- Holiday for voting for our president
- Tuition Free Education
- Increasing the minimum wage
- Paid time off for mothers
- Man made climate change
- Stopping the for profit prison system that are literally allowed to sue a fucking state if they don’t have enough prisoners

If NONE of these appeal to you than what IS your plan for the Democratic party and how is it different from a Republican plan?

I don't mean ""you"" anyone can answer this but again. If you are cool with at  least one or two of those options on the list above we're cool."
147,fe1kei,"You are. 

""I’d sure as fuck be pushing socialism and Bernie Sanders too.

Libertarians are just Republicans want to smoke pot on Sunday instead of going to church."
148,fe1kei,"Agreed. Though 

where do you think the party is moving as a whole? 

The idea is to push the democratic party towards more progressive ideals. Isn't that the distinction here between the two parties? Conservative ideals vs Progressive ideals? If both the Democratic party and the Republican party don't want taxes raised to pay for more social services than what are we actually all voting for? 

Incremental change is fine but it's starting to get harder and harder too define what those changes actually are. 

Not for medicare fo all? Cool but neither are Republicans so where is the party for progressives?"
149,fe1kei,"I can admit that there are better ways to handle these sort if discussions. Please keep in mind that what I was hoping for was a discussion about competing ideas regarding what it means to be a progressive and wether or not the party even has to be progressive. Maybe we have too conservative parties? Sure why not? People defending their right to be a Democrats regardless of their actual believes is weird since the beliefs ARE the distinctions (i.e. believing in climate change). Read though my comments I'm just asking what exactly makes a Democrat if I can be a gun loving aborting hating poor people bashing Democrat? (I'm being hyperbolic to get my point across) then I guess words have no meaning? 

I'm trying to point out the differences between the parties are becoming less and less and answering with ""people have a right to their beliefs"" while technically IS an answers it's not something I'm debating. 

I appreciate the advice."

I don't think anyone is being disingenuousness but Democratic figure heads (NOT. THE. VOTERS.) are really the issue here. What's the point of having two political parties if both parties arrive to the same conclusions that we should not champion progressive ideals. The point is that there should be some kind of qualifier for being called a progressive and I don't think just being IN the party is enough. They're voting records have to reflect progressive ideals. I mean isn't it weird that a lot of Democratic big figures started off way more right and the party had to pull them further center.

159,fe1kei,Are you saying every year add a state to the national healthcare system or wait 10 years and enroll every state?
160,fe1kei,"The objective is not realistic as the DNC is basically reversing the original plan for ACA, and putting forth a platform that only sounds ""left"" because the ""right"" has shifted so far over. In any 1st world country Biden would be considered a hard core right politician and not a candidate for the working people.

Also moving towards the direction of universal healthcare isn't ""wanting it all"", it's wanting it not to go backwards. Trump will campaign on healthcare for all, but Biden is not. He will lose just like Clinton. She campaigned as a ""center"" candidate until she won the primary. Then she pretended to ""care"" about traditional democratic platform values, but her platform was worse compared to Trump's empty promises."
161,fe1kei,"Cool, I totally see your point about the minimum wage and if I was a job creator I'm sure I would feel the same way. I can appreciate that you have a different experience than I do and I'm not looking to demonize you for it. Like I mentioned before I feel like I hold two contradictions in my head. 1. America should continue to support some level of capitalism since I actually like working hard and being rewarded (I'm lucky to have the opportunity to even try). 2. People should be payed a living wage."
162,fe1kei,I totally get that. Education is a sticking point for a lot of people. It's not even something I would benefit from so it's hard for me the gauge how important this issue is for a lot of Americans. Healthcare is more of a need education would be a nice to have.
163,fe1kei,"But the DNC didn't stop Bernie or anything

He's only 75 electorates behind Joe..."
164,fe1kei,"Create the infrastructure and provide the option, at the state level, to enroll. Then...sit back and watch the states enroll. They will once they realize that on the UHC offering, nobody goes bankrupt."
165,fe1kei,"ACA failed. I live in one of those ""any 1st world country"" and guess what...even we consider Ol' Joe senile. Not right or left...just lost...sort of.

If you don't want to go backwards...don't. The USA could...and should IMO...setup a completely government controlled HC offering. That would INCLUDE a government owned and operated insurance provider. That's the only way it can possibly work. Then...let the states join as they like. In a decade, they'd all be signed up.

As a Nationalist, Trump could do this...and it wouldn't surprise me if he tried in a second term.

I think what a lot of ""lefties"" forget is, elections are ""contests"". As such, the objective is to WIN the election...not run about claiming some sort of nebulous ""moral victory""."
166,fe1kei,You don't think the DNC is trying to stop Bernie?
167,fe1kei,I don’t really see an issue with that. I’m all for states rights and I get states have vastly different needs and consideration. Your idea is not bad. I would add that in a practical matter I could see all the states rushing to sign up at once but I’d imagine that’s something that could be adjusted for.
168,5c1lyr,"The DNC caused this by pushing their own agenda instead of what the people wanted. It's the polar opposite of what the Republican Party was struggling with. They were trying to reign in what the people wanted to push their own agenda. All. I can say is FUCK YOU, DNC! YOU FAILED US!"

It was really surprising. This whole election has been twists and turns, can we all agree on that at least? My head is on a swivel and I'm still trying to thought process that a non-politician businessman just walked into office. No government or military background. It's interesting. I would've liked to see how Bernie or Rubio would've played it out. That's just me though. "

185,ev6bx4,None of these candidates can win.
186,ffx5qc,"Corruption is present in both parties but only called out on the GOP side because the media is so crazy biased.

The media is good at creating the vision of an evil GOP, but fails to reign in the Democratic Party to the DNC's own harm.

If the media did its job rather than acting as Crony Mouthpieces of the controlling interests then we'd have actual choice in voting. The fact is we have the same choice with either an (R) or a (D) but they're identical with the only differences being at the extremes, which sadly control both parties.

I'll get to vote in my state's primary later, but it's so late that I'm not sure it will even matter.

And, given the choice between incoherent Biden and Trump--I'll vote Trump. Most politicians are pretty smart but play dumb for their audience; Biden, to meet him in person, really is that dumb. As a Senator he was punching way above his weight class already. He's definitely NOT Presidential material.

When he says things like, ""We'll settle this out behind the shed."" he really means it because that's Joe Biden. He's just the neighborhood guy sitting at the end of the bar ready to prove his manhood in a feat of strength or a brawl to show he's the bigger man. Nobody told Joe that isn't really how the world works, and he's just a dolt who can't take a hint.

So, in the Dotard race for President, I'll take four more years of the current Administration over a senile and declining bar brawler.

What is it with the party of ""diversity"" racing to show that it can be more white, older, and more male than anyone else? Does anyone else find this disturbing?"

195,ffx5qc,Why would I vote for Trump? What gave you that idea?
196,ffx5qc,Idk what her ideas are. I can’t support sanders and warren because they support a wealth tax that would destroy the economy. If a 1% wealth tax came into effect Elon musk would owe close to $1bn when he probably only has $10mn in cash assets so he’d be forced to sell off his companies which would put people in positions to push him out of his own companies. All billionaires would face this issue and I guarantee if rumors even started that a wealth tax was coming Elon would move back to Africa and take his companies with him.
197,ffx5qc,Aww man poor him. We should let him get richer.
198,ffx5qc,"Yeah and this attack the billionaire bs, we are gonna run out of billionaire real quick."
199,ffx5qc,Wouldn’t hurt anyone so why not? I’d rather allow rich people get the right to keep their money vs we shoot them in the head for committing the crime of being rich and then wonder why the economy is going to shit.
200,ffx5qc,We’re not talking about shooting them. We’re talking about them compensating their workers more. They still get to be rich just not as rich
201,ffx5qc,"Just because their rich doesn’t mean they aren’t compensating their workers fairly. Their workers are free to go to other companies if they please and more so companies aren’t as profitable as you think. Imagine if you can pick 10apples an hour for $1 each. Paying you $9/hr would leave $1/hr in profit.  Now suppose he has 10,000 workers, then the owner is making $10,000/hr and is rich, but if you wanted to raise the workers wage to $11/he you’d put the whole business under."
202,ffx5qc,Lolol. I got a business degree that’s not how it works. This is literally the way republicans say business works to people who don’t understand business.
203,ffx5qc,"Lol I have an economics degree. You can pretend owners can pay lots of money to workers, but typically they can’t. Since you have a business degree tell me what kind of margins McDonalds or Burger King have."

213,9in8tu,"This has everything to do with politics. 

We live in a nation that responds in the most extreme way to a difference of opinion. We take any slight on us or our beliefs and give 100% outrage back. The problem is, if we are outraged over everything, how do we know if ANYTHING is actually worth being outraged over? This man took the problem this nation has and flipped it on its head. A black man should have every reason to throw down with a member of the KKK and tear him apart. But he chose to do the one thing no one in this country knows how to do anymore: LISTEN. try to understand and ask questions. Discuss the things that make us similar until we come to figure out why we’re different. Many times, the answer is so small that we can walk away from a conversation with a completely different world view. Politically, we chose hatred over love. Spite over understanding. Violence and manipulation over discussion. This man is an example of how tremendous our country can be if we lower the damn volume for once."

When I came into the us I was being helped by English speakers who got me to learn English. I was at the wrong place at the wrong time and u got detained and had to translate for ICE and the other detainees until my trials (turned out okay).

Most of the immigration issues have no other proper solution. ""Imprisonment of toddlers"" is a terrible way of saying it. The only scary part was having big white dudes trying to talk to you in English, unknown to them wether you were going to act up and fight for no reason or let ICE do their job.

The Muslim ban. I didnt like it, but the French didn't act up about immigrants and look at how many terror attacks they've had recently.

Racism is a social issue, not a political issue."

219,fe8rf7,"You're right on most counts. The Electoral College dates back to the debate between popular representation versus equal voting weight. The problem isn't the E.C. but the way the states (most, anyway) have a ""winner take all"" rather than an apportionment of the popular vote within each state. If all States apportioned their votes then the EC would very closely follow the popular vote.

Anyway, the parties control things to their own advantage. Most third parties absolutely don't try to win a national election. All they're trying to do is hit the magic number of 5%. At 5%, the funds that people check the box to donate money to the Presidential Campaign Fund is unlocked. So, with every donation of $3 / taxpayer, the parties strengthen their control over everything. No third parties can access that cash windfall while the GOP and DNC each get equal amounts from it.

Primaries, IMO, should be done along Senate lines with ~1/3 being voted upon in three national primary days. They would need to be staggered slightly from the Senate races in the current year to avoid an imbalance of power among states, but I would like that system.

Finally, the Primary system itself is actually a construct of the two party system because having multiple candidates on general election day would result in potential chaos or the election of a minority candidate like Bernie Sanders. The Primary system is designed to lock out people like Bernie or other fringe candidates or third party candidates from winning. The Primary to general election cycle is created as a means to ensure that ""Democracy"" is anywhere from limited to mostly eliminated."
220,fe8rf7,That's the problem. They think you can't win with a popular candidate. Or rather they don't want to win with a popular candidate because it doesn't maintain the two party duopoly.  When you have a popular candidate you might actually expect folks to show up and vote instead of our appaulingly low turn outs.
221,fe8rf7,"Thanks for the detailed response, I was beginning to think I was the only one who cared.  When you say 1/3 being voted upon do you mean 1/3 of the candidates?  Or more like one third of the states voting?  If the latter would you have them randomly pick which states when?  And why not all the same day because I don't really get the point of staggering, it just encourages voter apathy and fatigue.

I'm totally in with the two party monopoly. In that exists, not that I think it is a good idea. There was a Freakanomics podcast episode all about it and that it is an actively managed construct sounds highly plausible to me.

I think having a strong third party - or more - is probably the only way to ensure democracy where we all get some representation instead only about 50% and even then let's not kid ourselves either party is really serving us. It's the money they serve."
222,fe8rf7,"Partially true. Elections are popularity contests. Bernie's very popular with college age people and a bunch of quite reactionary type people. They've decided, apparently, that capitalism hasn't worked, so socialism needs to be implemented. And Bernie's policies would require a taxation level nobody in the USA wants to see. Ol' Joe is not only ""damaged goods"", but he's not really as sharp as he may once have been. He's popular with most Democrats...compared with Bernie's policies and tone. He's the ""safe alternative"". Both have tried to be POTUS and both have previously failed to even win the primaries.

All the Democrats had to do, is find someone who can beat Orangemanbad, and they came up with 2 failures..."
223,fe8rf7,"1/3 of the states vote in three waves. It would permit the candidates to get out to the States and visit voters.

That's the way the Senate is elected (1/3 every two-years). However, to prevent larger emotional swings the states voting should not be the same cycle as the Senate because an outsized influence in a given election cycle would exist--electing both Senators and the President in the same year with large influence on both. So, at a minimum, the active Senate elections should be in the last wave of the three stage of voting rounds."

To ""kill it where it doesn't"" according to...you?"
226,fe8rf7,"Ok. let me clarify.   
You are a conservative. No?"

229,fe8rf7,"No. I'm not ""ok"" with any reactionaries. Left or right."

236,7ddfah,"Trump said nasty things, but is there a proof that he actually did it? "
237,7ddfah,"This woman's story doesn't stand up. She claims she was groped...she's wearing an armored vest in that picture. If she lied there, should we believe her other story?"
238,7ddfah,I guess that works in the Roy Moore case (he did it) but not the Al Franken case where there's a pic.
239,7ddfah,There’s literally a picture. 
240,7ddfah,If people could stop being disgusting human beings that would be great. I think both (Moore and Franken) are guilty. There is never a reason for this type of non consensual behavior. 
241,7ddfah,"""When you're a comedian, you can just go up to a woman and mime grabbing her boobies through half an inch of bulletproof padding, everyone will laugh, and then when it seems like a politically convenient moment, she will shriek that she was abused."""
242,7ddfah,"Over 20 women have said he did, including allegations of rape and statutory rape. "
243,7ddfah,"The picture is obviously a really poorly thought out prank/joke. He might not be touching her, even, but it’s still something that shouldn’t have been done. 

As for believing her, that’s up to you. I was highlighting the disproportionate response among conservatives who are calling for Sen. Franken’s head for this while ignoring more numerous and more serious allegations against Trump and Moore. 

edit: typo"
244,7ddfah,"There's a photograph that doesn't support her actual accusations that she claims is in the photograph. She is clearly not being actually physically groped in that picture like she claims it to. Is it distasteful? Absolutely, but doesn't support what she's saying, and has already started her accusation with a blatant lie.

Also, OP, wtf is with this comment? 

> If you're a straight male and you say you wouldn't I question your believeability.

Sexual assault isn't OK regardless of what gender you are or what gender is doing the assaulting. "
245,7ddfah,It's ok done to me by someone that looks like Kate Upton. You're not the arbiter of what's ok for me.
246,7ddfah,"Since you're so informed about the whole thing, did he also try to stick his tongue down her throat?"
247,7ddfah,"What you want done to you is between you and whomever. You explicitly say you wouldn't believe any guy that would call sexual assault, though. That's a different story altogether. "
248,7ddfah,"I don't know, I wasn't there, but if she is already verifiable lying then we owe it to everyone, especially victims who have been silenced by false accusations, for more information to come out. If her accusation is true then there *has* to be corroborating evidence. Someone who can confirm they were alone together, a copy of the script asking her to kiss him, someone who heard her scream at him. This didn't exactly happen at a private affair. This was an open event for the military. "
249,7ddfah,Didn't say that. I said I'd be happy for her to sexually assault me. Most males would. Big difference between the power of men and women.
250,7ddfah,"You did say it, I quoted you. You are a sick individual that thinks someone's genitalia lends more credence to their believability than whether or not they're actually lying about verifiable events. "
251,7ddfah,Thanks for telling me what's right for me. Mind if I take you so I can get your correct directions for my life on future issues? Thx in advance!
252,7ddfah,"Again, as I said before, you do you. Just please stay off any jury where a man is accusing a woman of sexual assault. In your own words, he would be hard to believe for you. "

Hey that's great, but that's not what Ron Paul has on tap. The rest of the article is nothing but glowing praise for Ron Paul, sans citation.

If you sincerely know of and advocate Ron Paul's positions, then you were a fool if you voted for Obama in the past presidential election. It's great if you have since found something that more closely matches your views.

This HuffPost (heh?) post would've been more sympathetic of the poster had said, ""This time, it's a McKinney/Moore/Kucinich/Gravel challenge or nothing!""

263,fczua6,"Sanders - Calls himself a ""Social Democrat"". His platform would require such high taxation that it would resemble Communism. Result - Trump win.

Biden - Has serious issues with his habitual use of his position, to enrich his family and friends. Also has some serious gaff issues. Result - Trump win.

The Democrats really should have not let their anger and hatred, drive them to this mess."
264,fydz16,"Brainwashed zombies indeed! They'll vote for anything with an R next to it to their own peril.

This tribal mindset is getting worse and worse each election and currently their drunk on their power spewing out their alternate reality babble.

I have so many words to write.. yet I'm speechless as everyday they cover the last with new drama.. And it's all planned!
Say what you want now and fire up the base with B.S because they dont fact check nor will they recall or care what was said because theirs a new mountain of lies on top of that.

They've become accustomed to being lied too but it works in their alternate reality, You cant show them charts, graphs or anything factual, They wont even look because it doesnt fit into their world of lies. How do you live your life not knowing the truth or facts? Can their minds not handle it? Is it too much.

Their being led by their party mimicking their church practices, Dont question what your being told. Dont believe your lying eyes! Gerrymandering.. voter suppression.. stealing elections!!

What has America become.. No one needs to invade you all your tearing yourselves apart. Luckily your a continent away from everyone else and you only have to worry about the corporate invasions on your wallets. 

Republicans rob and loot and then Democrats clean it up and keep it stable, Republicans get the economy going red hot and cause a crash and Democrats clean it up. 

My mind sees it's all pre planned, You know their making money off of these pre planned crashes. Then their bailed out and the middle class is decimated once again. 

I talk to Republicans who claim Obama caused the last housing crisis, He wasnt even in power!! He repaired it after Bush left!! The stupidity of these people to not research facts but it doesnt matter to them..

Where is all this leading?.. Is the point to get all Democrats and independents to throw their hands up in the air and quit and let Republicans control the military and bring about their end of the world scenario. 

You know that's what they think.. They spend like theirs no tomorrow yet whine when Democrats spend anything to further everyone. Who wants a stable world full of happy people. Jesus wont return in those conditions"
265,fydz16,"Welcome to the side of normal people, OP

A good metaphor I heard once was that republicans are like zombies, and it's especially true now."
266,fydz16,"I didn't vote for Trump, but I'm Canadian so...

I sit up here though, reading US opinions and watching this war go on. It seems to me, that Donald J Trump evokes such a negative emotional response from so many people, that it resembles some sort of spell.

I also see the base of the Republican Party basking in Trump's presidency. Wallowing in his unpolitical personality and his nationalistic policies. It amazes me that the religious right is able to stand behind this guy, who's left a trail of fairly unholiness in his wake throughout his life. But...follow they do. Why? Its actually incredibly simple. In fact I also think its the simplicity of Trump's base appeal, that produces such unbelievable frustration in Democrats.

MY NATION FIRST! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Democrats...the people want a rational and beneficial response to the blood-letting that Globalist policies have imposed on the American middle-class...and indeed the middle-class of the entire western world.

Ya know...were the Democratic Party able to find a candidate who can make American's their primary concern, and express that openly and proudly...you'd win.

Simple as that."

280,f11ks0,"I just don't see how nominating a Republican is a good move for Democrats.

Just from a politics standpoint, the resurgence of the GOP over the last 40 years isn't because they ran to the middle.  Success will always be about firing up the base, and I don't see some Billionaire doing that."
281,f11ks0,"I personally don’t see the big deal with him being a billionaire. It’s a problem with the system, not the candidate. He’s been a decent mayor other than the stop and frisk, and has great proposals for gun control and climate change, which I consider the two most important issues at the moment."
282,f11ks0,"TBH, I'm not threatened by the idea of making a boring billionaire with no personality disorders president.

I mean, I know I'm the dog in the ""this is fine"" meme, but frankly, Bloomberg is a very normal person. I mean, of course I don't like the stop and frisk stuff... but I think he is trying to make peace with that. It seems that he realizes his former republican self was a little too much.

This is just my opinion. I'm going to vote blue no matter who."
283,f11ks0,"Wanna stop drunk drivers from killing sober drivers? Ban sober people from driving. That’s basically what Dems want out of gun control. Tell me how it makes sense, please?"

He's never been my guy, I'm a Bernie fan myself, but he seems to be putting a ton of money into the race and gaining ground. I will also vote blue no matter what. We have to!"
285,f11ks0,"That’s quite the strawman. No, most dems are looking for more comprehensive checks and controls on who can buy guns. In any case, I think there is a problem with guns being viewed as a human right, but that’s another separate issue."
286,f11ks0,"I'm glad my insight was useful! He's definitely not my first pick either: I like Bernie alot too.

The only nominee that would be truly awful if they got nominated is Gabbard. She is a bad faith candidate - some kind of russian troll."

304,aiud6m,"You could say the same thing about Fox when Obama was President. While CNN does lean left, I think they give a fair voice to conservative view points, unlike Faux who has their hosts and commentator scream over the one or two liberals they allow on their shows. "
305,aiud6m,The news isn't made to inform you. It's made to get you to watch it for as long as possible. CNN thinks talking shit about Trump constantly is what its viewers want just like fox thinks praising trump for everything he does is what their viewers want. What I would do for a news source that does its best to inform in a way that is as unbiased as possible.
306,aiud6m,He's the president. When Obama was in office Faux News complained about his suit color. 
307,aiud6m,All democrats get a pass because they are democrats which means they are virtuous and perfect. Their bigotry is totally fine. I could care less about downvotes are being banned. Fuck all you hypocritical fuckers. 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
308,aiud6m,"If that is what you are looking for, then listen to NPR News. As far as I can tell, they are the ONLY national news service simply presenting facts, as well as some well balanced commentary for difficult subjects. CNN has become the left wing Fox News. It's purely political now, and set on using inciteful language and steering a narrative. I'm a liberal myself, but I cannot stand entities like CNN and Fox promoting ignorance. The only way to save this country from what it is becoming is a well informed public, not Pavlovian dogs automatically reacting to keywords."
309,68sm67,Because it's stupid and there's no legal basis for it
310,68sm67,"Well, that's not *entirely* clear. While no laws were broken, the legal system can be used to enforce contracts, charters, letters of incorporation etc. The violations on the part of the DNC/DCC leadership would fall in this area. To be clear, the Dems are free to nominate a rock if they want to, they just can't necessarily do that in violation of their own legal documents. I doubt this will all result in anything noteworthy. At worst they might be penalized with a small fine and the legal equivalent of a vigorous finger waving."

Than I realized I actually liked Obama's policies and once people started turning on him I had no problem voting for him in 2012.

It sounds like I just vote to be a dick but really this time around isn't everyone claiming it's the end of the world? I don't think a Trump presidency will make it unsafe for women to go outside, I don't think a Hillary victory will mean a nuclear war with Russia.

I am leaning Hillary though as Trump is appealing to Christian conservatives, and I do think he'd repeal Obamacare."

We've only been saying this kind of crap would happen for years... but you guys all supported Bush and how he needed the Patriot act to ""Protect us""....

331,1ftv1h,"Totally not trying to distract people from the NSA scandal, the IRA scandal, and drone scandal. Definitely not distracting from any of those at all."
332,1ftv1h,What the admin is doing now breaks the rules of the Patriot Act. Supposed to only spy on americans that are suspected of being involved in terror. Obama is collecting all phone calls from all people so he can use it against them later. Scary info for someone who harrasses and tries to intimidate political enemies.

335,1ftv1h,I just find in hilarious how you Republicunt Teabagger anti-Obama people are suddenly against the patriot act when everyone else was screaming about it when Bush devised and the Republicunt Teabagger congress passed it into law. This is EXACTLY what we all said was going to happen. i don't know why you find it surprising all of a sudden. Just remember Obama or whoever is president does this because Bush and you Republicunt teabaggers thought it was a good idea and the Government should legally have this right.  The started recording everything you look up on the internet back in 05'.... and you Bush lovers supported the Hell out of it... Now it's suddenly an issue? I am far from an Obama lover... he was merely the lesser of two evils... had we elected another Republicunt there would be even MORE laws like the patriot act allowing the Govt into our lives and reducing our privacy and freedom
336,1ftv1h,"The law was never intended to be used like this. In fact, the rules of the patriot act are being broken. No where does it say they can just collect all data. Obama even campaigned against it and was going to stop it. But again, there are several things he campaigned against then did the opposite."
337,1ftv1h,"As if democrats were against it. (which I am one and not a republicunt as you call me) It passed so easily in the house and senate it's laughable. 98 yeas and 1 nay in a democrat controlled senate. In the house 357 yeas vs 66 nays which 2/3 of democrats voted yea. Face it, both sides wanted this badly and isn't Bush fault and shouldn't be the one to be blamed for passing it, even if he vetoed it would still have a high chance of passing because of the sheer amount of people backing it back then."

Well done.

And yes, any foreign national attempting to sway American voters is a douche.

Oh...it's you again...the stocker. I should inform you that I'm a happily married man. My ""loose lips"" are for eating and kissing my wife. Terribly sorry if you misunderstood. As for this pre-occupation you seem to have with feminine hygene today...as I asked on the other thread...does it sting?"

356,i4t87v,"I’m a republican and he’s right I’m also black American Latinos tend to be more open to other races and ideas and blacks want to kill every white person and they hope they die.

365,fxjp1i,"Short answer: because I identify as a moderate Democrat and believe moderate policies are what America needs, and the only thing the GOP will let pass. 

Obviously his political career isn’t perfect. His biggest flaw was that he sided with the wrong side of history to score cheap political points in his early years, but that hasn’t been the case since he became nationally known. However Bernie’s biggest flaw is the lack of accomplishments. 

I 100% back Joe Biden and believe in him, and I truly hope you change your mind about voting 3rd party. If even half of Gary Johnson’s base from 2016 voted for Hillary, we wouldn’t be in this mess. I admire you for actually voting, but please realize a 3rd party vote is a vote for the person we’re trying to vote out."
366,fxjp1i,"I'm voting third party and trying to get as many people as possible to do so. You Biden voters should have recognized were the youth and energy was in the party. You picked the wrong guy. Now enjoy losing to trump. You guys had nothing really to dislike about Bernie but we despise  Biden and will not vote for him. With Bernie we would have had a turnout large enough to beat trump. With Biden no way. Do some self reflection on you centrists views, stop watching mainstream media, and get your info from online podcasts like young people do. The mainstream media brainwashed you into being centrists and you lost in 2016 because of it and will again in 2020. Wise up stop holding the country back!!!!"
367,fxjp1i,"Because people in the upper middle class like things they way they are and don't want any change. Change is scary. Change that might help people other than them is very scary.

It seems unfair. The idea that they had to suffer through insurance and having no health care? Well, other people need to suck it up and suffer too like they did."
368,fxjp1i,"Please don't vote 3rd party, that will deliver another 4 years to Trump. I didn't vote for Biden, don't really like him BUT if we don't stick together and vote for him we deliver the WH to Trump. Beating Trump and the Republicans is our only way to fix this country, AGAIN!"
369,fxjp1i,Because Bernie's platform would necessitate a taxation level that would deflate the Dollar and create the same conditions as the Soviet Union?
370,fxjp1i,"Trump... anyone not voting to get trump out is a petty little self serving hater...you butthurt babies did this to our nation..,you let your feelings kill all these recent vitcums.,you are just stupid....you kills poor brown people and caged little kids...you are worse than trump.,narcissist who only votes for themselves.  Your feelings are just for you not anyone else,.I pity you


Now you just can't be doing that..."
371,fxjp1i,"Vote 3rd party. The moderates keep playing this stupid chicken game where they’re hoping voters will buckle under the pressure of electing Trump again before moderates have to go any further to the left. I voted for Bernie because he gave me something to fight for not just something to fight against. 

When moderates mention Trump it’s just so they don’t have to actually sell you on policy. Trump is how moderates scare you into voting for your party without having to actually offer you anything for your vote. You obviously don’t want Trump to win right? So it’s either Trump or Not Trump. Biden doesn’t have to offer you anything. The Democratic moderates are just banking on you not having a choice. Moderates just plan to shut up long enough so Biden doesn’t put his foot in his mouth again. Even when Biden was accused of sexual assault moderates are so terrified to actually take a position they’d rather all just shut up and ride it out until November. Just keeping Biden hidden until November isn’t what I would call something to vote for.

Your vote is literally the only power you have to send a message. Don’t give them your vote. Make them earn it.

P.S. I would not give my vote to someone who is accused of sexual assault. Even if the moderates democrats all forgot about #metoo. Progressives have not."
372,fxjp1i,To not vote is to give trump four more years. And I voted for the Bern.
373,fxjp1i,"I voted for Pete the second my mail in ballot came and was devastated when he dropped out but I would have voted for Biden only because sadly I don't think America is ready for a Bernie type... and I don't thin Bernie was the one that would deliver the amazing policies he was proposing. the communist party of America endorsing him would spook a lot of trump's base who's proven to be near indestructible and above all else the blue wave in 2018 happened with moderates. I don't like that this is the way it is but its the way it is and sometimes you have to play smart, not hard."
374,fxjp1i,"I really like your points. But I do live in CA so I don’t think it will matter at all. 
The other thing that I want to say is that Bernie probably didn’t do anything notable but that’s cuz nobody gave him the chance. If he had become president then you bet he would have done a lot of things. I’m just tired of the interest groups and politics. And how the Dems try to force a candidate like Hillary rather than listen to the people and let it naturally happen.  Before then I was an a Andrew Yang supporter.  I keep getting disappointed by my party."
375,fxjp1i,"I'd say being a segregationist who wrote the 1994 crime bill aren't ""cheap political points"". There's a deep vein of authoritarian right-wing about him."
376,fxjp1i,"They had something very strong to dislike about Bernie.

Bernie would change things in a way that they couldn't sit around insider trading, getting favors from big business, and ending up making seven figures as paid lobbyists on K street as a thank you for taking money and doing what lobbyists asked over the years.

The top 1% of this country do not want money spent on people. Health insurance should continue to be a massive money making racket. Drugs like insulin that cost $2 to make should be sold for $700. And there was Joe Biden, in their enclave, saying ""Don't worry guys, nothing will change. Nobody's standard of living will change. I need you.""

They would rather lose to Trump than lose this system."
377,fxjp1i,"If I live in Maryland or Oregon, voting 3rd party won't affect a god damn thing. The only time voting R or D really matters is if you're in a swing state. The only way for your vote to matter in a non-swing state is to vote 3rd party."
378,fxjp1i,"I understand where you are coming from but I live in CA. So my vote will not matter. But what it does is give an extra vote to a 3rd party. This allows them to get more funding and if they reach the national stage, it will finally break our 2 party system. I hope that puts your mind at ease."
379,fxjp1i,"You do realize that ""Bernie or Bust"" was a promise, right?"
380,fxjp1i,He lives in California. Don’t worry
381,fxjp1i,"I’m not defending Bernie but isn’t that exactly what this $2 trillion bailout has done?
And wouldn’t Medicare for all end up saving taxpayers money?
We also have 60% of our national budget towards military and it’s growing. We can certainly throw a percent or two of that our way and that would save us a few billion. 
I’m a small business owner. I pay taxes through the nose unlike massive corps but I’m ok with it because it supports my community and my country. The USA doesn’t have a taxation problem as much as it has a budget problem but frankly both. 
I guess what I’m trying to say is that I think we can bring the best minds in the country together and critically think through & solve the problem without succumbing to previous problems faced by other countries."
382,fxjp1i,"Deflate the dollar?
We just printed off 2 trillion."
383,fxjp1i,"Not so. Medicare For All is cheaper than every other way of doing things out there. Also, legal weed, being taxed, would generate a ton of revenue."
384,fxjp1i,So what you are saying is that Biden has a better chance of beating Trump?
385,fxjp1i,"> is a petty little self serving hater...you butthurt babies

This must be the famous overture to progressives we keep hearing about. This wonderful concession and welcoming with open arms the Biden people are gushing about in their own orgy of self-congratulation.

How about this instead? Someone you love or care about will become or has become one of the 68,000 a year dead that die because of the ACA and for you single payer is not negotiable."
386,fxjp1i,Wow! I love your answer and that’s exactly how I feel. You put it so well :)
387,fxjp1i,"So vote third party if you're otherwise not going to vote. Let the Biden Hive and the Trumpistas bash it out between them and start building a progressive party that actually gives a shit about people, not companies and rich campaign donors."
388,fxjp1i,"I understand. I'm also in a solid blue state (Ohio), so I'm free to vote my conscience. People in swing states will have to make a tough decision about who to vote for in November."
389,fxjp1i,"Well you’re probably right about it not mattering if you live in California. That’s guaranteed blue. I live in NC, so it’s a little different for me. We flip flop every four years lol. If you live in California, definitely vote for who you think is the best choice. Hell even write in Bernie lol. 

And I feel your pain on the Yang thing. I was initially a Beto supporter, then a Pete supporter lol. 

The issue lies with the people in my home state and other swing states who COULD make a difference with their vote. But hey, if you really do live in California, this is me, a Biden supporter telling you to vote third party if you really want"
390,fxjp1i,Was pissed off until you said you live in California.
391,fxjp1i,You are absolutely right Rogue One ;)
392,fxjp1i,"Cool! I'm in a non-swing state. Since my vote doesn't matter, I'll use it more constructively. Thanks!"
393,fxjp1i,"Spot on. My brother lives in D.C. He voted third-party last election to prove a point.

That's what someone should do in an entrenched district with a guaranteed outcome."
394,fxjp1i,"Whether it was a promise or not, we have to do what is best for the country now. I am hoping we can get a better progressive candidate in 4 years"
395,fxjp1i,"His vote will still count in the total number of votes, popular vote"
396,fxjp1i,"> I’m not defending Bernie but isn’t that exactly what this $2 trillion bailout has done?

No...it isn't the same at all. For one thing, this ""bailout"" does not gather power and control to the government. It finances a part of the nation in a time of extreme hardship.

> And wouldn’t Medicare for all end up saving taxpayers money?

I think it would. But you can't demand it all at once. This needs to be done incrementally.

> We also have 60% of our national budget towards military and it’s growing. We can certainly throw a percent or two of that our way and that would save us a few billion. 

You can make a good case for that. I don't know how the general public would feel about it though. America loves its military might, and the nation is able to use it as a bargaining chip...which is a plus.

> I’m a small business owner. I pay taxes through the nose unlike massive corps but I’m ok with it because it supports my community and my country. The USA doesn’t have a taxation problem as much as it has a budget problem but frankly both. I guess what I’m trying to say is that I think we can bring the best minds in the country together and critically think through & solve the problem without succumbing to previous problems faced by other countries.

I'm a small business owner too. One man show in fact. And I know that what you say about taxes is true. OUCH and a half. And I too am good with paying, as long its not being wasted on silly crap.

Its not the desire to ""even the playing field"" for the middle class, that anyone objects to. With Bernie, AOC and the like, its the down right demand that all change now. Its also that friggin' brainless Green New Deal."
397,fxjp1i,"$2T? They literally threw a trillion a day at the stock market. No fanfare, no discussion, just started shovelling money at it. When it's something important like the stock market, nobody asks questions about the deficit. $30T so far and counting."
398,fxjp1i,ROFLMAO...ya ok...
399,fxjp1i,"Yes we saw how Obamacare was...cheaper...

You are being completely disingenuous as you ignore the devistration the his Green new Deal would bring."
400,fxjp1i,"What Ohio is not a solid blue state, in 2016 Ohio voted Trump, in 2008 and 2012 Obama, in 2000 and 2004 Bush, Ohio is the exact definition of a swing state."
401,fxjp1i,Ohio is always listed as a solid blue State very much like Florida. They never change...
402,fxjp1i,LOL Ohio is a swing state
403,fxjp1i,"I have no idea where you get that from.

Nearly every poll or analysis I’ve seen has Ohio as swing or leaning R."
404,fxjp1i,Lol yeah it doesn’t even matter. It’s a protest vote anyway. Cuz if the DNC is manipulating the candidates then that’s not right.
405,fxjp1i,I love your username
406,fxjp1i,Thank you for your great responses to each of my points. Change is tough. And bringing it on incrementally may be our best bet. We are a young nation and are constantly trying to improve. Hopefully we can just keep getting better and not fall like the Romans.

410,fxjp1i,I love you both
411,fxjp1i,"You're quite welcome. And change is tough. People naturally want to resist. Some more than others. A form of Obamacare would work, as long as it was open and that each state could decide for its own, whether to allow it or not. As about a decade goes by...they'll all get signed up. Just the way we did it in Canuckland...which is even younger than your nation.

Don't worry about the Romans...they were Roman. You're American. That's different. Better some would say. What's important...IMO...is that whatever track the USA, and especially my own nation, take, it needs to be done in the name of the actual and measurable benefit of OUR OWN NATIONS...respectively."
412,fxjp1i,"Oh my...a ""greenie"". The Green New Deal is nothing more than a power gleep. I grand lie designed to have the population willingly hand over everything. The people who propagate this grand lie...need a gawd-damn spanking!"
413,fxjp1i,"No way is Ohio a lock to go blue. Trump won Ohio by a little over 8% in 2016, the last time anyone won the state by over 5 points was Clinton in 96. You have to go back to 88 to find a president who won the state by more than Trump did in 16. If Dems show up to vote in November Biden should win but I would hardly consider him a lock."
414,fxjp1i,"Oh my.... a group that actually will work for single payer and try and avert disaster.

415,fxjp1i,"Disaster? What disaster? The climate changes...so what? If it scares you so much, don't buy a house on a coast. But don't expect people to flock to the absolute destruction of the global economy for...lies and absurd doom's day predictions...that never come to pass..."

421,fbuw6y,Well obviously these raffles are for the kids to get class trip money etc. Tickets are sold to anyone but you still have to go thru the process (background check) to get your prize.
422,fbuw6y,"I grew up in Idaho, which is where this appears to be from googling the sporting goods store. This is all very normal for countryside communities.  Most of my friends and I took hunter's-safety courses around 5th grade, and many of us had our own guns or access to the family's guns at those ages. You can be concerned, but people are allowed to decide what is risky for their children. Riding horses and farm-equipment accidents were responsible for far more injuries to people I knew than anything gun-related.

People sell raffle tickets for things people want.  Obviously this is a community where a good rifle is seen as valuable.  People in the country look at guns as tools and recreational equipment.  It's sold from a sporting goods store, not a black-market arms dealer."
423,fbuw6y,If your from a rural area you would know this is normal for schools to do my middle school had hunting competitions
424,fbuw6y,Lol it’s a bolt action anyways
425,fbuw6y,"I have had a hunting rifle or shotgun ever since I was 14, being a gun owner doesn’t instantly turn you into a republican. I have voted democrat or independent every time I could. A responsible 5th grader that attends a gun safety course, is safer than most adults with a gun."
426,fbuw6y,I have to wonder...which would be worse? Having a little 22 for gopher shooting and learning to handle a firearm? Or getting handed a 44 handgun in Chicago and told to defend your turf?
427,fbuw6y,It's a hunting rifle. Don't be a dumbass.
428,fbuw6y,Considering that most NRA nut jobs and rednecks don't go beyond third grade this must be some type of incentive to stay in school and they can say they have advanced education.
429,fbuw6y,"So today my sister told me her 5th grade class is having a raffle and that I should buy a ticket. I then asked ""well, what is the prize if I win?"" I was a bit ""caught off guard"" when she said, ""it's for a huge gun, a rifle""

&#x200B;

I'm having a difficult time deciding whether this is right or wrong. Please tell me what you think?

&#x200B;

My sister is 10 years old, in 5th grade, and attends a private Christian School. I'm just curious... Did the students decide what would be Raffled? A teacher? The PTA? 

THERE'S AN ENDLESS AMOUNT OF POSSIBILITIES THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT PRIZE... WHY A RIFLE OF ALL THINGS????

&#x200B;

Can't forget the best part, here is the flyer/envelope that was sent home with all the kids to collect money from neighbors and other members of the community."
430,fbuw6y,I'm extremely pro-gun but this seems inappropriate even if it's a private school
431,fbuw6y,I don’t think a school would raffle this especially a elementary school but ya know anything to fit the narrative.
432,fbuw6y,"Huge gun? Hyperbole only exacerbates the other side of the aisle. Most pro gun folks are going to call you out for being ignorant if you focus on things like “huge gun”-when it’s like 44-50” max(smaller for rifles)
And you are given the option to take a 500$ gift card.

So, if I understand this correctly, you think that you should have control over what someone donates for a raffle?

Or, are you angry that someone may get a gun without proper credentials?-bc that’s assuming a lot between winning and getting a gun, in hand.

Or, would you have them NOT accept a prize from a pro-gun store such as Dicks sporting goods or Academy sports? 

Or, guns and school being used in the same sentence shakes you to the core and you came to reddit where similar unhinged outrage is a normal, and you want-nay, NEED 
 your ECHO(echo) CHAMBER(chamber)"
433,fbuw6y,"
>THERE'S AN ENDLESS AMOUNT OF POSSIBILITIES THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT PRIZE... WHY A RIFLE OF ALL THINGS????

I posted a longer comment on the overall thread, but just to address your question - because people raffle things that have a proven track record of getting a lot of tickets sold.  So obviously you live in an area with a lot of people who hunt or enjoy recreational shooting.  They're not trying to promote a political ideal, it's purely about fundraising.

What type of raffle prize do you think would likely sell more tickets in your community?"
434,fbuw6y,"Are you in Idaho as others have suggested? If so, there do not appear to be requirements to the registration for transfer of long guns (rifles, shotguns, etc.)."
435,fbuw6y,Really? 500$ gift card to sporting goods store? You read that you have options if you win
436,fbuw6y,It also depends on where you live. Our schools closed for the first day of buck season.
437,fbuw6y,Well the gift card to the sporting good store is a great idea that way the winner can decide to buy a rifle or buy camping gear. And I honestly don't care either way I was just trying to stir the pot LOL that's what Reddit is all about right lol. It did however make me think though which I don't do much of being I from Idaho.. Kidding
438,fbuw6y,"Haha oh yah, I always appreciate some pot-stirring."

441,be2j3a,"i got banned from beto 2020 for asking questions , trying to start a discussion, debate 

&#x200B;

so i guess we cant talk or do anything contrary to their ideas  even if its logical, true and simply asking for info"
442,be2j3a,What is the point of people trying to talk if you won't let them talk? That is the whole point of Reddit to talk. Why ban people for having a different opinion than you or people trying to have a real discussion on things. Why ban people for trying to get a discussion started let alone a debate?  Are the Moderators afraid of harder questions then on a CNN panel?
443,be2j3a,Maybe the admins are afraid to have their opinions challenged. How ironic for people who are supposed to defend free speech. They can't accept the fact that there is also a diversity of opinions within the Democratic Party.
444,be2j3a,"Did they ban you when you posted it the first time, or when you reposted it an hour later?

They've also got a rule about not posting negative things about the Democratic Party. 

As an aside, there's also 17 campaigns that are about stopping Bernie Sanders. It's called a primary and it's not a surprise."
445,be2j3a,"I thought something had gone wrong the first time because it wasn't showing up under ""new"" which is when i reposted it. I used the exact same URL and didn't realize that /r/democrats didn't have an automated filter for double postings like most subs.    

I was temp banned and so I replied to the ban and asked what the reason for the ban was. That was when I was permanently banned.    

I totally get an /r/hillary or /r/dnc taking this kind of aggressive moderating stance but /r/democrats should be a place for all democrats, not just the ones David Brock likes. Might explain why they have 90k users compared to /r/SandersForPresident with 244k.       
Rule 4, technically, says nothing divisive. I have noticed that the legions of posters who regularly trash Bernie Sanders or post articles trashing Bernie Sanders don't receive any of the aggressive moderation that is present on that sub."

A minority of very loud, very annoying fascists have USED the George Floyd murder and BLM (which is a disgustingly fascist and blatantly racist organization to start with), to execute their anti-American horse kaka. Today these LOSERS are treading on very thin ice.

And ICE is about to crack and deliver a healthy swath of these fascists to the cold water of deportation. As for the rest...I believe its against all sorts of laws, what they've been up to of late. Arrest and cage them."
466,hbqnpl,"This is a huge over generalization about ""the left"" in r/Democrat. This sub has become a breeding ground for people to come trash Democrats with misrepresentations of ideals. Just like y'alls examples, just because some of the left take the movement too far doesn't mean the left in general ignore it for cops. 

It grinds my gears because people say ""oh I don't make this logical fallacy, they do"" and the fact is you can support both police officers and the BLM movement because you support the good cops and the fight for justice and equality without the destruction and violence."
467,hbqnpl,"So are you saying that other black people who don't directly participate in a crime but only allow it to happen, associate with known criminals and fail to report crimes aren't punished?

Because they are.  Its called being an accessory to a crime.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_(legal_term)

The issue here is that cops that know about the ""bad apples"" don't intervene.  When they actually have a duty to, while civilians don't *always* carry that duty legally. 

https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/21/us/crime-bystanders-no-charges/index.html

A cop's actual job is to uphold the law.  It is what they are trained to do and what they are paid for.  

A reasonable comparison would be a doctor. Doctors are meant to heal/attempt to heal their patients.  That is what they are trained to do, it is what they are paid to do. 

So if a doctor knowingly allowed a fellow doctor to actively hurt their patients, kill them, or deceive them into paying for unnecessary procedures they would also be held legally accountable. 

This is the crux of the problem.  Cops aren't weeding out their ""bad apples"" they are actively defending and covering for them. (In many, many, many cases.  There are always outliers. Some are taking the necessary step to root out bad apples.  It just needs to be *everyone*.)

I think that is a simple point we can all agree on."
468,hbqnpl,"Yeah. Shit happens. No one can stop 100% bad things from happening. Btw, if no bad things happened, there would be no growth and life would be dull. Also, people forget Tony Timpa died the same exact way back in 2016. Hmm hmm hmm..."
469,hbqnpl,"This sounds like what Hitler and Musolini used to do. Yeah, fuck em."
470,hbqnpl,"Your gears are being grinded for no reason. Your whole argument doesnt sit with what I experienced. I couldnt do both. I was shamed for it. Either one, or the other. I dont care what this sub has turned into.. I care that this country has turned into a huge VS battle. Division everywhere. You are worrying about the wrong thing."
471,hbqnpl,"Firstly, I didnt say a damn thing of what you said, dont put words in my mouth.

Secondly, blacks weed out their bad apples? Come on. Nobody weeds out their family members or close friends. Cops are, by a fair amount but not so many, comprised of family members, you have lots of cops who became cops because their dad or uncle or aunt or whatever were cops or are cops or hold a high rank in the institution. It is why there are investigations from other sources. This is how you weed out bad bad apples. That accessory punishment might exist, but it has its flaws. You cant just expect everyone to be a law abiding citizen, hence you need law enforcment, but that too has its flaws, everything has a flaw in it. Just because of that flaw you cannot cancel the whole damn thing, only fight where the flaw is, not the entirety of it. This is exactly what Im saying. Nothing less, nothing more."
472,hbqnpl,"Bahaha gaslight much? There is definitely reason to be dissatisfied with people who can't make logical arguments and contribute to conversations. I can be annoyed and frustrated by people relying on logical fallacies and trying to force only supporting one of two not mutually exclusive things. It doesn't mean I'm consumed by it or it's the only thing that concerns me. 

Division is stoked by literally everyone. Everyone wants to blame others and not take personal accountability. To me this sub is a place to converse with people about news, policies, etc. without having toxic people relying on logical fallacies to convey ideas. And now it's basically people like you saying to other ""Democrats"" you're concerned for no reason and worried about the wrong thing. So no wonder the country is in disarray, we can't even have a civil discussion in r/Democrat."
473,hbqnpl,"Your comment tried to compare the fact that the left doesn't stereotype all black people based on those who commit crimes, while simultaneously condemning all cops for the crimes of some.  That was your point correct?  Am I misunderstanding and putting words in your mouth?

I never claimed that black people ""weed out"" rotten apples.  I said that they are legally required to in some circumstances. While the same is not required of cops.

My comment illustrated that your comparison is really apples to oranges.  

Not expecting every civilian to report and shun crime is not equivalent to expecting those whose job it specifically is to do so.

It's not a hypocritical stance.  A patient of a doctor (they would be the civilians in this example) are not bound to the same duty a doctor (the trained and paid professional: cops) would have to report it.

I agree there are flaws.  That wasn't the point I was trying to make."
474,hbqnpl,👌 okay bud!
475,hbqnpl,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
476,hbqnpl,">I agree there are flaws. That wasn't the point I was trying to make.

But I was. This whole time. You are opening another argument. And in regards to your argument, not required for cops? If there are suspects or witnesses they will be called for investigation, or to confess before judges wether they be a president, a cop, a lawyer or even another judge. Where is it written that cops are untouchable by the law or cannot be called to confess?"
477,hbqnpl,"...you can't though.  That's literally what ""apples to oranges"" means.

I think we will have to agree to disagree.

Edit: oh damn you're a bot.  Or having a huge glitch."
478,hbqnpl,"Holy shit dude we just keep talking past each other.

I *understand* your point was to try and give an example of a flaw.

However my *reply* clearly explained that your example of a ""flaw"" was incorrect.  

Your point was trying to state that its hypocritical to stereotype cops (""they are all bad apples"") but NOT stereotype all black people as being criminals when *some* black criminals exist in their community. 

That is literally what you wrote.  If that was not your intention then you need to revise your comment because that's what its interpreted as.

And MY comment was clearly illustrating why your statement is not accurate. 

My comment also DID NOT state that because your example wasn't valid that there are then NO FLAWS.  My comment only addressed your specific example.

I also did not say that cops are untouchable by the law.  Now who is putting words in who's mouth?  

But obviously, if you have watched any news from the past few months then you know that there is an issue with cops evading the law.  If you don't agree with that, then no further conversation can be had.  Because that would be denying the literal reality of the situation. 

I am sorry if I confused you.  But I've spent way too much time trying to explain our exchange and feel like it's useless for me to try.  You seem to want to create a fight.

I'll step aside.  Enjoy your weekend.

Edit: so I see now you are a kid.  So the confusion is somewhat understandable, this problem is much more nuanced than black and white and only experience will teach you that. 

It's awesome though that you are getting involved and learning.  Keep going man and just practice kindness.  Good luck!"

493,f7cfg7,I think conservatives don't like/are insulted by the idea that (1) Trump needs outside help to win and (2) that these less-than-desirable foreign powers want *him* to win.
494,f7cfg7,"They’re also helping Sanders.  And Bernie’s comments on Cuba and Castro, and his staff’s comments on gulags and land confiscation and murdering capitalists, it’s terrifying to Hispanics and Cuban immigrants in Florida, as well as us Midwest moderate democrats. 

Bernie is absolutely frightening. 

I voted for him in ‘16 and I feel stupid that I didn’t see this side of him.  He cannot be allowed to be nominated, Russians backing him or not."
495,f7cfg7,Right on that
496,f7cfg7,"Why would you think conservatives are insulted by that? 

Let's really be blunt about the type of ""interference"" these Russians managed to produce. Essentially they managed to hack Podesta's email account at the DNC, because the dumb twit GAVE them his bloody password. They also posted trash on Twitter and Facebook. That's about the size of it.

People will pick a favorite horse. Why should any conservative care that Putin prefers Trump?"
497,f7cfg7,The outside help he received was Hillary’s campaign and the media.
498,f7cfg7,"Its an interesting how far left Bernie now feels he can safely go. Its very concerning to see all the real fanatical support his position has.

The Russians are not ""coming"". They're here. Have been for a long time now. On the flip-side, American political interests are already ""in"" Russia too. And China, and India, and...

This whole argument has been a joke to begin with. Its the Democrats using a ""boogyman"" to scare Americans into questioning their own POTUS. And because we now know that it was the Democrats who actually USED Russian misinformation and in a sense...""colluded"" with Russians, the fullcourt press to misdirect focus to Trump...MUST continue. And it will, unless Barr has the balls to air all this and make the indictments."
499,f7cfg7,"So generally the resistance to that idea from that side is more about how ""Russia would love to have Hillary in there"" or some nonsense.

Alot of conservative ""fandoms"" are about pride: being stronger, smarter, something-er than the other side. Very emotional."
500,f7cfg7,"LOL...no...I really doubt Russia would want Hillary-Billary back. Not because she can't be bought...she obviously can. But simply because...the woman's an insufferable bitch.

""fandoms""??? Why must Democrats do that? Are you trying to pick a Hillary-Billary-style ""bitch-fight""? 

Staunch conservatives...of which I am not one...tend to believe they represent rational thinking. That's not always the case, of course. But for the last few years, they have made more rational sense than have liberals. They do value strength...and do have their own whacky extremists to deal with. Just like the liberals. I think one difference ""might"" be...is that a conservative will tend to find strength in financial well being, a large national military, and for many...their Gawd. Liberals tend to find strength in what? Numbers maybe? I don't know anymore, and I used to lean left politically.

But man...I just don't recognize them anymore..."
501,f7cfg7,"Trump is strengthening our military standing with Ukraine providing weapons and trying to get nato members to pay more

 Bernie Sanders  wants to cut military spending by half doesn't care if nato members aren't spending  on the military I'm not sure about his policies on aid to Ukraine but I can assume he won't be a big fan of it considering his hate for military spending and being involved in conflicts 

It's funny how Democrats themselves always talk about this mass cover up conspiracy when they themselves have suspicious ties to Ukraine and meddling in our elections they accuse Republicans of trying to influence the Georgia governor's race and various house races when they themselves have been accuses of such things  like the governor's race in Kentucky and the interference of the 2016 election by literally reaching out to foreign governments to obtain documents on Trump  and also having spies in the Trump campaign

Also at this point it means practically nothing when a democrat says it's the Russians literally any Trump supporter online is immediately called a Russian troll or any news story or  study that is pro republican is immediately a Russian troll u can't take it seriously"
502,f7cfg7,"Liberals generally do not identify with the ""winning means you're superior"" mentality: ""Win at any cost"" is not one of their values. They run on numbers and data and such."
503,f7cfg7,"Uhhhmmm…

""Basket of deplorables"". 

Liberals ""assume"" a position of ""moral superiority"", and the quote above lays waste to your idea that ""Win at any cost"" is not a liberal value. We could also include the DNC's rather thorough frigging of Sanders, in the 2015 DNC campaign. They're-a-gonna do it again to Bernie too...just watch...they've already started.

So ""no""...liberals are certainly not terribly concerned with ""numbers and data and such"". They may have at one point, but that point is gone. They appear to have placed their faith in endless accusations and ganging up on opposition, through drowning them out...""outing"" them...or simply beating the shit out of opposition in the streets. Sort-o' like the infamous Brown Shirts.

In short...today's staunch Liberal...has serious anger issues...accompanied by deep feelings of inferiority and desperation, hidden by volume, numbers and a mask of moral superiority.

That's not one issue, that's THE issue. This also assumes that his policies would be universally supported by Democrats, which is a poor assumption.  

> And when hard times come, he wants government to first take care of the little people, not the political donor class, as both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have done. Sanders also wants universal health care, paid for with tax money.

Obama *wanted* to support the little people too. Hillary *wanted* universal healthcare in the early 90's. Recognizing what is an is not practical in our real political climate is not the same as wanting things. 

> His plans, if smartly put into law

When is the last time this happened?

> More than 80% of Americans support raising taxes if necessary to permanently maintain Social Security, with strong majority support among Republicans, according to surveys by the National Academy of Social Insurance, Social Security Works and others.

Because ""raising"" taxes is a vague metric. It says nothing about how much. 

> This is essentially Sanders' stance. What's so radical about that?

It's the ""how much"" and just ""how"". 

> Sanders also wants to invest in the future of America by making public universities free again. The money would come from a tax on Wall Street speculators who buy and resell stocks in less than a second.

Another idea that is great in theory. 

> The Sanders campaign notes that ""last year, Germany eliminated tuition because they believed that charging students $1,300 per year was discouraging Germans from going to college"" and that the Nordic countries and many others provide college free because it spurs economic growth.

The scale and diversity of our economy is in a different league. 

> Meantime, Sanders would restore the ability of workers to form unions and bargain jointly. 

Really? He would personally do that? Are we electing a dictator or a president?

> And those are the policies of the Sanders campaign.

The key word here is *campaign*. Obama's campaign was all about change as well. You don't have to be a political expert to see the real challenge of the office is not coming up with ideas, but actually turning those ideas into reality. He has been a member of the very Congress that has disappointed all of us, so he knows as well as anyone that most of these things will never happen. I don't see how his unrealistic promises could be considered anything but misleading.

Hillary can't hide from a record because she has a record on a national stage. Bernie has no record other than representing a small, extremely liberal state. It would be like a departmental manager claiming that he can run a company better than the CEO. *Maybe* he could, but it's not enough to just criticize the CEO, you actually have to demonstrate how you would realistically do better.

536,44oddk,"> I doubt Clinton's integrity. She changes her positions based on political expediency

I don't doubt her integrity. She is a politician and she owns that. She won't try to gloss over the reality of politics even when she knows that it will mean more shit-slinging from the Republicans and Bernie's campaign. I have less trust in someone pretending to be *above it all*. To think that anyone makes it to that level without playing the game is just naive. Bernie is playing a game just as much as she is, except that his strategy is to make unrealistic promises because it's working and let Hillary face the lion's share of scrutiny. How is deflecting questions about how he would deliver on his promises not an issue of integrity? If it stops working, he'll change tactics, guaranteed.

>  She changes her positions based on political expediency (I honestly have no idea what she believes in), is favored by wealthy donors, and has shown that she is in favor of war when it is not necessary.

If you follow the history of her career, her changes make sense in the context of decades of political history and learning from her experiences. There's a huge difference between fighting for a cause, getting knocked down, dusting yourself off and changing your strategy than just arbitrarily changing your mind. 

Regarding wealthy donors: this is a convenient way for Bernie to capitalize on the fact that he's not getting large donations without actually having to convince people that he's a better investment. Again, it's a reality of politics. His grassroots funding isn't going to help the people he's supposedly stands for if it just sets us up to lose to the Republicans. I'm all for campaign finance reform - it would be great if someone who is an experienced member of Congress would lead those policy changes, I wonder who might be a good person to do that. Until that happens, I'd rather not have the Democrats set ourselves up to be at a disadvantage. 

Regarding the war, she has admitted that she was wrong. Keep in mind that the Bush administration *lied* about the justifications for starting that war and she was representing the state that was attacked. Bernie simply was not in the same political position at the time. If someone makes a mistake, I want them to fess up and tell me what they would do differently the next time. What does Bernie have to say about what he's learned from being a part of an ineffective Congress who he would have to rely on to make his promises a reality?"

Gonna shoot the other foot too?"
575,g0szvq,"I am in TOTAL agreement with you. Democrats have screwed themselves. 

More explicitly, the elite and geriatric ""OK Boomer"" Democrats have screwed themselves and everyone else with a conservative agenda that does little to nothing for the rest of us.

These geriatric Democrats, who run the show, give the rest of us nothing positive to vote for.

Their whole agenda is based on:  Trump is bad, throw him out, don't ask for more."
576,g0szvq,Second times a charm
577,g0szvq,"If you want to make your vote matter, vote Green.

Getting them to 5% will get them federal funding.  15% and they will get a seat at the table during those Presidential debates.

Neither the Republicans nor Democrats want that."

579,g0szvq,"I'm discusted with Biden and Sanders. The  wall street puppet and the commie bomb thrower. With luck (and half a mind), Biden will choose Warren as running mate and beat Trump then have a stroke and we'll have president Warren.

586,g0szvq,"Which in theory, will prevent progressives from changing anything for sixteen years.

Not bad, neoliberals. It'll be the conservative agenda for almost 20 years. Well long enough to make everyone forget about this Bernie guy."
587,g0szvq,"He’s very likely NOT going to choose warren just FYI. In the last debate between him and sanders- he said he had a woman of color pick basically (when asked by the moderator if they would look for a woman of color, Biden said his veep would be one). I personally hope it’s someone with a progressive platform to round in some of the Bernie camp and hopefully warren camp as well!"
588,g0szvq,Ah yes Warren. The lifelong Republican who suddenly decided she was a Democrat.
589,g0szvq,"I'm not voting for a guy who is in a clear state of mental decline to become our president. Please do not tell me that he is not because any person can see it plain as day. The fact that the dnc is pushing him as their candidate while wearing blinders regarding this makes me sick. Trump is going to walk all over him with a pair of old-fashioned metal golf cleats during campaigning and debates. By parading him around in this state the dems are showing they have no moral compass just like the repubs. 
As I said above, the only thing that might, I repeat might change my tune is who is picked as vp.

I expect those 2 to go at each other like junkyard dogs. Man...you could sell tickets...and they will...

To me, there is only one issue. Globalism Vs. Nationalism. Can you guess which way I lean? I'm sure you can, eh?

But to not vote...write in another name, write in your opinion, hell start a third party.

593,g0szvq,Compare the Sanders platform to the Green Party. You'll be very pleasantly surprised.
594,g0szvq,"Biden and the conservative Democrats will be to blame if Trump wins. Biden refuses to appeal to the vast majority of voters who want Progressive issues resolved in their favor.

597,g0szvq,"Right! Because nothing screams your rights as a woman than voting for someone who doesn't think a woman's right to her own body rests entirely with her.

Vote the old man, Catholic, serial sexual harasser if you want. That's one way to get female empowerment I guess?"
598,g0szvq,"You know as well as I do that voting third party is just as effective at doing nothing as not voting at all. I wish it weren't true, but it is. The only thing that may sway me is Biden's pick for vp as there stands a good chance that person will become president through succession (due to Biden's rapidly declining mental state) if they win the election."
599,g0szvq,">Ol' Joe should never have gotten into this. I said that the day he announced

603,g0szvq,Perhaps.
604,g0szvq,"It's called an **election**. Candidates point out their virtues and their opponents lack of virtue. Bernie dealt out his share of criticism too.

Like Obama *finally* gave in to idiots who continued to claim he was not born in America by calling a news conference to show his birth certificate, Elizabeth finally show her DNA test results, which did indeed show she had some Native American ancestry. Obviously, being blond haired and appearing not that much what most people would associate with Native American features, everyone knew it would not be a high percentage of Native ancestry. But she shut Trump up just like Obama shut the rumor that started with Trump that he was not a native born American.

FYI: The state Elizabeth is from, Oklahoma has a high percentage of it's population with varying degrees of Native American ancestry. Oklahoma was the end of the [Trail of Tears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears), where Native Americans from around the US were force-marched when the government decided to violate treaties and force them onto squalid reservations on land no one seemed to want at the time."
605,g0szvq,I got 10 dollars in Kamala Harris
606,g0szvq,Elizabeth Warren.
607,g0szvq,">  Elizabeth finally show her DNA test results, which did indeed show she had some Native American ancestry.

She is absolutely NOT a Cherokee. And to be honest, that DNA test is not accurate when making those assumptions. Not that far back."
608,g0szvq,"Yuck! Please not the hypocritical district attorney.

As a centre/right conservative...I was impressed with Tulsi Gabbard. If Democrats wanna actually WIN...she would be a marvellous choice for VP. And hey..as an ex soldier, she can fend off Ol' Joe's pawing and come-ons definitively."
609,g0szvq,It will be Warren. They decided this in January of this year.
610,g0szvq,She's annoying.

619,ehpys1,This really doesn't matter seeing as President Trump is going to get reelected and the GOP will take back the house 🤣🤣🤣
620,ehpys1,"Great idea.  However, the article I wanted to link to is from The Intercept and r/democrat blocks links to that site.  I suspect because they are willing to criticize establishment Democrats and this subreddit seems to encourage partisanship... a team mentality."
621,ehpys1,"It's not smart, it's morally bankrupt and shows he believes in nothing.  Democrats are supposed to be about criminal justice reform (at least this time around) and if you benefit from keeping people in prison for cheap labor to support your own campaign, you aren't going to change the system.  Your incentives are wacked in such a case  It's a conflict of interest.  Here's a a hypothetical example imagine a prison warden ""rehabilitating"" prisoners by having them learn a valuable skill remodeling his home...  Again, conflict of interest.  It is not a matter of saying prisoners should not work.  It is a matter of who they work for and what they're doing for work in such a case. There's a reason why Bloomberg wanted to distance himself from this.

Not only that, but speaking of criminal justice reform: Bloomberg was behind the Stop and Frisk policy.  Not sure if you're familiar?  If not, I recommend looking into it.

""In 2011, at the peak of the practice, the NYPD stopped 685,724 people;  53 percent of them were black, 34 percent were Latino. Black and Latino males between the ages of 14 and 24 made up 4.7 percent of the city’s population — and 41 percent of the stops. In 99.9 percent of stops, no guns were found.

Stop and frisk also didn’t make the city safer. Since a federal judge ruled against the practice in 2012, stops dropped drastically. And so did crime.""

Crime went DOWN after stop and frisk went away.  It was completely unnecessary and ruled as unconstitutional in court (because it was).  It is an example of the draconian system we have here in the USA.  Bloomberg only apologized for it right at the time he decided to run for president, which clearly is not genuine.  To come up with such a thing as a ""solution"" in the USA shows a lack of respect for freedom, democracy and regular people.  So does using prison labor for your campaign's benefit.  Compare this with Bernie Sanders who relies on volunteers and his staff members are unionized. Bernie also has comprehensive criminal justice reform plan.  Bloomberg, predictably, does not.  Because he doesn't really believe in it.  He's just a billionaire who self-aggrandizes and feels entitled to be president (wants power).  It's a very different way of interacting with humanity."
622,ehpys1,Unfortunately you're probably right.  I have no faith in the voters.  I'm surprised the USA even still exists as a country.

* She has voted against protections for refugees
* She's aligned herself with Hindu nationalist figures and has kind of a bizarre personal background, where she grew up in a religious sect that was maybe-a-cult and is maybe-still-associated with her campaign?

628,d2egnc,"Tulsi falls behind Bernie for a lot of people is part of the issue she is having. She should have endorsed him this time and set herself up for a very strong run in 2024 or 2028. Tulsi is a wild card and thats going to scare a lot of people. She does a lot of things that for good or bad make people raise eyebrows and her history is often at odds with itself. I dont dismiss her by any means....but I dont see a reason to chose someone like her over someone like Sanders who has literally decades of consistency and a broader coalition/name recognition. 

As I said, Tulsi should have endorsed Bernie (and ideally taken on Warren for endorsing a cheater while she resigned) and after Sanders she would have been likely to be President."
629,d2egnc,She resigned her position at the DNC because she felt that the they were conspiring to unfairly prevent Bernie from winning. She has been on the outs with the establishment ever since.
630,d2egnc,She's absolutely not. Think Jill Stein circa 2016.
631,d2egnc,"Personally, she's one of my favorite candidates in the Democratic field, but I guess that's just me. I think she'd be at least a solid pick for VP, as I don't think she has much of a chance of winning the nomination."
632,d2egnc,"Most rank-and-file Democrats, when getting the opportunity to listen to her, like her a lot.  There's a reason she's the most googled candidate after the debates, and after the 2nd debate when she hit Kamala on her record, plenty of people were in her corner.

&#x200B;

In the left-leaning social media / mainstream media sphere, she is vilified (and has been since resigning from the DNC in protest).  That was ratcheted up to eleventy after going after Harris.

&#x200B;

A lot of actors (media, professional politicians, the politicos that get paid via perpetual campaigning) don't like that she has crossover appeal.  It's dangerous to the easy-breezy party-line bloodsport that sells.  If you ask most Dem voters on the ground, most would have no opinion, a neutral opinion, or like her from what they saw in the debates."
633,d2egnc,"But why? At this rate, she won’t have a place in the dem party after the 2020 campaign. Not her turn becomes no place in the party very quickly."
634,d2egnc,"These seem to be the common smears. Pelosi has also met with Assad, and meeting with adversaries for the sake of peace, diplomacy, is a duty the president should always be doing. PB compared that to Trump meeting with Kim, which I think was actually the only good thing Trump has done. This does not make Trump a good president, even a broken clock is right twice a day."
635,d2egnc,"Booker has a history of voting to favor corporations and is flooded with dark money. He has done some good things in his career, but he has also taken a lot of money from Wall St and big pharma and came to their aide several times. This makes many of us distrust."
636,d2egnc,this was proven and Donna Brazile apologized for it. And you're 100% right about the establishment.

668,i1jgus,[removed]
669,i1jgus,"Ummm....wait what?! I’m following this thread but your comment makes no sense.

Never, anywhere prior to your comment, did anyone state that protests were a business: you’re defending, utilizing an ad hominem attack, a defenseless position; the premise you lay out never existed.

No one ever claimed that protests were a business, in this thread. What exactly are you referencing?"
670,i1jgus,[removed]
671,i1jgus,"That very well could be the motive of the OP, and since I'm not the OP, I cannot take a stance either way. You may be right.

The comparison wasn't between businesses, churches, and protests. It was about the paradox of mandating the shutting down of churches and certain businesses due to the CDC and Fauci's claims that crowd-volume and social-distancing increased the risk of spreading covid-19 contrasted against Fauci's seemingly remiss attitude towards the massive crowd-volums and lack of social-distancing at these protest events.

Given what we know about how Covid-19 spreads so far, if you were to view your average Sunday Church service in the midwest, and compare that to your average protest in one of our major cities (Such as Portland), ANY medical professional would tell you that given the massive crowd-volume combined with a tremendous lack of practicing true social/physical distancing, church services would be FAR safer to attend than a protest.

Just like how US Citizens rights to protest are protected, and have remained protected through the pandemic, so too are Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Assembly rights available to churchgoers, yet church's, schools, and some businesses that are of a far less threat to covid-19 spread have been shut down, causing devastation to the socio-economic health of our country and world.

The hypocrisy of it is fairly clear. I'm not saying one side is right or wrong, but just pointing out and highlighting the paradox of it all.

The fact that Fauci, as educated and an old boy in politics as he is, and as intelligent as he is, responded in the manner which he did, particularly during his moment with Jim Jordan, with the facts that we know combined with common sense, I found to be concerning and bizarre.

Honestly, it appears to me that Fauci is the one who is so desperately playing politics in his moment with Jim Jordan, whereas Jim Jordan is playing facts and also happens to be a typical republican. But it is fallacious to throw out anyone simply because of their political affiliations. 

Politics are NOT black & white."

686,hyhu52,"Hi how would you know people don't like me!? you don't even know who i am! the majority of the country is republican, and i got a lot of friends and family, unlike your liberal a**., I'm dad."
687,hyhu52,"what are you even talking about lol. nobody is talking about who likes you or who doesn't. Can you not read?? The majority of the country is not republican, not sure where you grabbed that stat from. Who cares about your friends and family lol, nobody was talking about that. Re-read what I wrote, you are flaming someone for being a democrat posting on a republican forum, while you're a republican posting on a democrat forum. The irony, again, is totally going over your head on this one lol. Also, why do you tantrum like a 4 year old?"
688,hyhu52,">Nagger 

The rest of what you said went unread because you instantly gave a tell it would be a waste of time.

See ya."
689,hyhu52,Unlike my liberal a**... how dumb are you? I ain't a liberal. You just copy and pasting everything I'm saying.
690,hkejir,"This is fucking stupid.

32 years ago, Joe Biden misspoke, and he gave some speeches wherein he didn't give credit to speechwriters? Yawn.

Today, donald trump knows russia is paying bounties on American soldiers abroad, but hasn't done a damn thing about it except to try (and fail) to get russia back into the G7. He calls our generals ""idiots"", he trusts vladimir fucking putin over our own intelligence agencies- whom he derides as the ""deep state"". He wants to use the US military to squash peaceful protests by using force against American citizens.

Oh, yeah. Almost forgot the 131,485 Americans dead due trump's pathetic response to the covid.

691,hkejir,"Every one of your ""stats"" are made up. The only real thing in your post is your liberal hatred mixed with your hypocritical liberal excuses for your own kind. How's bidens taint taste???"
692,hkejir,32 years later everything that spills out of his worthless cunt mouth of his is nothing but a lie including his fucking hair!
693,hkejir,">Today, donald trump knows russia is paying bounties on American soldiers abroad,

LIE.

> He calls our generals ""idiots"", he trusts vladimir fucking putin over our own intelligence agencies 

LIE.

> He wants to use the US military to squash peaceful protests by using force against American citizens 

LIE. He wants to use the US military to preserve the history of the United States of America. And to stop those who openly deface and destroy public proper and private property.

> Oh, yeah. Almost forgot the 131,485 Americans dead due trump's pathetic response to the covid. 

Biggest LIE of all.Much of that tragic number is directly due to Democrat Governors and Mayors packing infected people into old folks homes. An act that is so INCIDEOUS that one could easily charge Kuomo and the rest of those morons...with murder."
694,gj9fv8,"> The Senate is expected to vote Wednesday to renew the 2001 PATRIOT Act, and Mitch McConnell is pushing an amendment to the law that would expand the FBI's surveillance powers. An amendment proposed by McConnell would, for the first time ever, let the FBI collect records on Americans' web browsing and search histories without a warrant. Another amendment drafted by McConnell would give the attorney general more oversight of FBI investigations into political operatives, like the recent FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties to foreign countries."

696,g31uys,What values or ideology do you believe should represent the modern left?
697,g31uys,"The Green Party is pretty much the Sanders platform. They even invited him to run with them. 

That's who you should support if you don't support Look here, Fat, the Thing."
698,g31uys,The USA needs a third party badly.
699,g31uys,The founding fathers didnt believe in 2 parties but the current public and media only talk about the 2 parties so ita basically impossible for another party to be created
