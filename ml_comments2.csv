0,7gzh5a,I feel net neutrality is too vital a thing to leave up to a small indirectly elected group of people to decide.

Because trump told them to be - this is the real damage done by trump, the acceptance of anything he does without question.

This is the easy way out rather than elaborating on the real cause. Lack of critical thinking, lack of meaningful discussion, lack of better platforms that break silos. It's easy to blame a scapegoat. There will always be men and women like trump, who will do anything and everything to latch onto power. The world will never stop producing them.

It's the responsibility of society to make everyone inclusive. An inclusive society will nip people like trump at their buds. The real problem is lack of awareness, lack of proper oversight on media, lack of punishment on the media for reporting false facts.

>2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers.

>2011-2013, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace

>2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)

>2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.

There was also a period (personal anecdote) where YouTube videos would not fucking buffer. I had to go through a proxy to get the videos to load normal. I had at the time 150 mbps download. There is no fucking reason that YouTube should have been loading slow back then.

Just because you personally are not aware of the issue, doesn't mean it wasn't an issue.

The shaping of the packets you request could be so incredibly slight, you might not have even noticed but they can kill a website. Make something take a few more second to load, and someone just might leave that website, and someone loses that traffic. That is a good way to hurt competitors in an almost hardly detectable way.

The guy Obama put in charge enacted title 2 protections.  The guy Trump put in charge is trying to get rid of title 2.  That is all there is to it.  Implying that Pai is Obama's fault is ignorant and misleading.  Pure propaganda and fake news.
149,7gzh5a,To be fair he was following McConnell's recommendation who at the time was the minority leader. This also happened 3 years before net neutrality laws were passed. There was no way he could have seen this coming at that time.

Unfortunately, North Korea immediately reneged on the deal before the ink was dry, with nuclear residue even being found on the agreement paper and on some aluminum tubes even though they supposedly shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility.. NOPE

Meaning Pai's appointment was part of a trade. The GOP held almost every appointment hostage unless they got something.

Now you might argue ""Well Obama shouldn't have done that deal then."" But Obama's in a tight spot. Obama is the hostage negotiator in this situation. Worse: he can't just give up and tell SWAT to go in and shoot these particular hostage takers. He HAS to negotiate with them, because half the voters actually *want* them to do this stuff. So they aren't going anywhere.

'god' didn't forgive him, it was his supporters that forgave him."
551,7oj9cv,"Speaking of logical conclusion, why don't people take the make-abortions-illegal logic to its conclusion?

If you truly believe it's murder, you're going to have to toss pregnant women in jail. You'd have to lock up these women until they give birth (or miscarry). You'd have to restrain them throughout so they can't deliberately miscarry. However it ends, you'll have to send these women on to regular prison to serve the remainder of their term, and thus find a home for the child (if a human is actually born here).

If you can't see yourself sending your pregnant daughter that sought an abortion to prison for 9+ months, then you don't believe that abortion is murder. It's as simple as that."
552,7oj9cv,I think they do take it to that conclusion.
553,7oj9cv,It also helps to be a republican 
554,7oj9cv,"Because unless he's somehow completely realized the gravity of his sins and somehow realize he's been wrong, he's a bad, lying ""Christian"". God only truly knows if this man feels that in his heart, so whatever happens to him on Earth is one thing, but how he's judged after death is another can of worms. 

Basically, God doesn't believe what you say, but what you actually believe. I know there's a joke out there that you can just convert to Christianity before death in order to go to heaven, but that's not at all how it works. "
555,7oj9cv,His baby Jesus die for his sin.
556,7oj9cv,I'm fairly certain the only true religious people are hermits or whirling dervishes. The rest of religion is an excuse to participate in the community; Lord over people; or what you said.

So, you're saying you have personally talked to God to know this, eh?  ^(*speaking to those ""types of religious people"" as the ""you""*)

I'm distinctly *not* against people having religious beliefs, but that's just an irrational supposition - either because they assume things they can't know, or because they still hate people who do the things they did *even though* those people could also be forgiven (according to their rules). Really it's just that they cherry pick which of their views is important at any given moment, but their overall behavior/views are inconsistent even by their own rules."
617,7oj9cv,"Dismissals of policy like this are fine, but we must be wary of blanket dismissals of people as a whole. Every single person has legitimate grievances whether they're on the right or left of the political spectrum, so we should fight them on policy issues, NOT on tribalism."

619,7oj9cv,"People do exist that think this way, but people also exist that don't think this way, too. I understand you believe it is a majority, but in my experience, the people you describe are a vocal and visible sect, not the whole or even the majority. It's not good to write off a whole class of people as ""unsalvageable"" since you only create a more polarized environment and you do the same thing you accuse ""them"" of doing. You don't solve anything, you perpetuate the us vs. them mindset that hinders collaboration. You have to talk to the people who will listen. 

Picture this: Jim and Pam view themselves as conservative Christians. They read the Bible, go to church, and watch Fox News sometimes. They have genuine strong beliefs, and they would never vote for an adulterer, much less a hypocrite. HOWEVER, they are unaware that their congressman is both. They don't see beyond their sphere - they don't have anyone around them who isn't a republican, and when they talk in passing to other people they are insulted if they disagree with them politically, and are called hypocritical, mocked for their faith, but never have someone have a genuine discussion with them. Should they look beyond their sphere? Sure, and in my experience, some do, but Jim and Pam shy away from things when people are hostile to them. So the only people who actually talk to Jim and Pam are the scum like this congressman, their radical church mates, etc. and the polarization of society grows. 

We have to talk to each other and listen to each other if we want to succeed in this world. Yes, some people are going to be assholes to you because they disagree with you and write you off because of your beliefs. But you aren't showing them what's what by doing the same yourself - in fact, if you talk to everyone you disagree with with respect and the intent to change their minds you will, little by little, undermine those who do not by converting people to your side. 

I will imagine you are a very liberal individual. In this aspect I am different from you. But I believe if we have discourse like this, everyone benefits.  "

> Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, ""I am not the kind of person I want to be."" It must never sink into an assemblage of the self-satisfied.

> Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life. True religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The proper teaching is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you’ve always known.

> All men seek to be enlightened. Religion is but the most ancient and honorable way in which men have striven to make sense out of God's universe. Scientists seek the lawfulness of events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.

EDIT: No one writes big articles about a church that busses homeless people in from downtown to shelter them during a hurricane. And no one who actually believes the word of Jesus is going to proclaim the good they do: 

Matthew 6:1 “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

2 “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

The right understands implicitly that the best way to get people to continue to vote for you is advance their interests. 

A pro-life person will still vote for this POS because he publicly moves the policy needle towards their misogynist ideology. Upper middle class and upper class white men stay voting Republican because that Party has never deviated from advancong their interests since the 70s. The two previous Republicans that got ousted (Nixon and Bush I) were both perceived as inefficiently loyal to the base. Same with Romney. 

The Democrats always spew bullshit about ""bipartisanship""  or like Clinton (both of them), they fixate on appeasing and trying to peel off middle class voters. But then they enact policies that are so watered down that they help no one. Obamacare is a great example: pass a mealy-mouthed market based universal health care that leaves a lot of low-income people out while infuriating the Republican base. Obama was woefully naive at thinking the Red states would go along with the Medicaid expansion. They undercut him and whipped up their base anyway. They sent a message to their base that ""we care about your issue and will fight to the end."" All the Democratic base learned is that voting for Democrats is a crap shoot. But Obama and Clinton couldn't deliver for their base without alienating the Coastal donor class. 

The next Democratic President needs to embrace pro-labor policies, equal pay for equal work, universal pre-k and quality early childhood. If you have to reduce Defense spending that's fine. Better yet, dismantle the mass incarceration apparatus. If a Democratic President could do that then I don't give a shit how many celebrity and upper class pussies are grabbed if it helps the mass of single mothers, LBTGQ, and people of all color have a better life.

It's not as cool as you think to say ""Fuck christian values!"" to be an internet edgelord, and then go on to prove that you don't even really know what constitutes ""christian values"" as a contemporary term.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordeal_of_the_bitter_water

>A Sotah (Hebrew: שוטה‎ [1] / סוטה) is a woman suspected of adultery who undergoes the ordeal of bitter water or ordeal of jealousy as described and prescribed in the Priestly Code, in the Book of Numbers, the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible.

As in, the story has roots in Judaism, not so much in christianity.

Other excerpts of that page:

>According to Mishnah, Sotah, 9:9 the practice was **abolished some time during the first century CE** under the leadership of Yohanan Ben Zakkai.

>Although, as with later Judaism, the actual ordeal was not practiced in Christianity it was referenced by Christian writers through the ages in relation to both the subject of adultery, and also the wider practice of trial by ordeal.

Also, for someone claiming that abortion isn't murder, to turn around and then claim that it is, you look a bit more foolish, if that is possible.

Since you're still failing to comprehend, I'll give it one more shot.

The phrase I was responding to was ""Fuck christian values!"". No disclaimer of which ones, so it would be just for one to assume the original speaker, if that was not your super genius(/s), that it was meant to fuck all the values, because, edgy is cool or some shit....

I am not speaking specifically as to abortion being murder.  I'm talking about christian values in general, because that was the comment I was replying to, and then I gave a couple of vague examples:  No murder, no theft, etc.

These values and other *are* good for society.  Again, if you wish to argue that point, **do so**.  Go ahead, tell me why we should just fuck those values, why we should just go ahead and allow violence, murder, theivery, etc.  Explain why you feel that ultimate anarchy is healthy for society.

Don't go citing irrelevant and obscure ancient texts to tell me what contemporary(modern) ""christian values"" are, especially something so ludicrous as a story about adultery that hasn't been practiced in centuries even in the Jewish faith where it originated....meaning you couldn't even really cite the correct religion.  I mean, you can if you want, but if someone else calls you a stupid asshole for doing so, they're not really being mean, just stating what's plainly observable.

You are making the mistake of thinking that pointing out some ridiculousness is somehow relevant to the conversation.  You sound like a fairweather atheist, one that doesn't know jack shit, but has taken the anti-christian stance because you somehow think it makes you better or smarter, because reasons.  Being ill equipped, you seem to regurgitate talking points you read from some other edgelord who's at least cracked a book or two.  ""I said some words that I don't understand, look how great I am!""  Arguing the way you are is why many atheist edgelords are seen as laughable pieces of shit.

No, that is not how this works, that's now how any of this works.  Please crawl back into your hole or whatever Dunning Krueger study-lab you escaped from."

831,7oj9cv,"Not hearing the verse and not hearing the mentality are very different. While I've heard only a handful of times people talk about this verse in particular, they speak all the time about works vs faith and saved vs lost. There are other verses that indicate this concept, not just Matthew 7. For example, the whole purpose of the book of James is walking in genuine faith.

A Sotah (Hebrew: שוטה‎  / סוטה) is a woman suspected of adultery who undergoes the ordeal of bitter water or ordeal of jealousy as described and prescribed in the Priestly Code, in the Book of Numbers, the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible. The term ""Sotah"" itself is not found in the Hebrew Bible but is Mishnaic Hebrew based on the verse ""if she has strayed"" (verb: שטה satah) in Numbers 5:12. The process was a trial by ordeal administered to the wife whose husband suspected her of adultery but who had no witnesses to make a formal case (Numbers 5:11-31). The ordeal is further explained in the Talmud, in the eponymous seventh tractate of Nashim.

835,7oj9cv,Do you realize the 10 commandments are based in Judaism?
836,7oj9cv,"Do you know you're still being irrelevant and dodging the original concept?

Simple as can be since you still don't understand:

Many ""christian values"" are good for society.

Being against murder and theft is good for society.  Life expectancy only goes up if murder is cut to a minimum.  It's not some opinion of mine, it's objective fact.

Ergo: ""Fuck christian values!"" is not only edgelord material, it's borderline sociopathic."

841,85y5ja,Thats not how drafts work
842,85y5ja,"If there is a draft and you get five deferments and all five people who took your place died, why the fuck would anybody want to be there. Like take a step back and wonder why anybody should, or would want to get out of that. "
843,85y5ja,"That's not how the draft works.

He received draft deferments. One was for bone spurs and the other four were education-related.

If you were in college and had satisfactory grades, you would get deferred.

The bone spur issue didn't make him ineligible indefinitely, just for the time being while he had bone spurs.

So I'm not quite sure how he ""dodged a draft"" when doing so would result in jail time."
844,85y5ja,Did all 5 of them die?
845,85y5ja,Is there a reason for the number five specifically?
846,85y5ja,"No way he can walk that far wearing his ~~high heels~~ elevator shoes.

If this is truly a celebration like fleet week in NY, then let it be on a voluntary basis only. Or civilians can go ahead and do it and I’ll have a “thank you for your support” in the barrel ready to fire off.

We get supported plenty, almost no one doesn’t respect us and our sacrifices. There are better things to be spending our time on. Much better things. "
877,85y5ja,"Besides the crazy cost (That could be better spent actually helping vets), the fact that the Pentagon doesn't want to do it, the optics of the parade looking eerily similar to the types of military shows of strength that dictators use to stroke their own ego, the logistical nightmare of moving that much equipment and manpower just to show off, or the uncertain way this will be perceived on the world diplomatic stage given the hyperbolic rhetoric and out right threats of war our current commander in chief has been expressing over the last year? 

I don't know... maybe it will rain on the parade day and everyone's shoes will get soggy?"

943,89dmy7,So is the company amazon? Because I think it’s a little unfair to say this is happening strictly on “them owning a paper”. I’m like %90 sure we’re all liberals here so can we at least agree that one of the largest companies in America should pay their fair share of taxes? If trump gets them to pay the amount they should(which I doubt will happen) I can’t say that I’ll personally be against it.

Political inconvenience isnt my view, it's what's currently happening. It's politically inconvenient to stand up to him, when your donors benefit from him regardless of what he doesand did to get there.   

And no one in or around Trump is clean. He doesn't operate that way. He operates on loyalty. That's why he has nda's. You do dirty work, you keep your mouth shut. 

To think the Ryans and McConnell's aren't complicit by now is naive.  If nothing less, they are complicit through dis-engagement and turning their head to issues detrimental to the US, or democracy and a subjugation of their oaths. "

1027,89dmy7,"You really, really have to be completely out of the loop to not see the connection here. Trump has made deregulation and getting government out of business a centerpiece of his political career. He has talked time and again about lowering the tax burden businesses bear. That's like, 99% of his platform. 

So, now he comes out and suggests MORE regulation and MORE taxation for one particular company who just happens to own the media outlet which has been relentlessly critical of him. 

If this manchild somehow manages to cook up legislation or any other action from his angry shitroom tweets, it'll be direct retaliation on the press. It will be a direct attack on the free press. 

Granted...I doubt it'll come to that. I think he's just blowing hot air and being a dumbass, and I don't think he can rally the legislative branch full of Republicans to attack the richest dude on Earth. That just isn't how they roll. It's still pretty fucked up though. 

As far as liberals hating on Amazon for dodging taxes, being a shitty place to work, being a generally shitty corporate citizen...all that stands. But see, the left isn't so married to our ideas that we'll take them even when they come with a ton of baggage. I think that's the difference between left and right lately...the right will take a ""win"" no matter what. They don't give a shit that it betrays their other principles, so long as the win irritates at least one person slightly left of center.

""High crimes *or misdemeanors*"".



In the context of the times, ""misdemeanor"" was a pretty broad term, up to and including just being awful at your job. 



Anyhow, the actual answer is that the Republicans in Congress who would have to do the actual impeachment prefer to keep him in office rather than remove the leader of their own party in what would surely be a messy, messy affair. "
1137,89dmy7,"> Impeachment proceedings can only be started if he has committed a crime.

Flat out wrong. And there's no such thing as ""impeachment proceedings."" Impeachment is akin to an indictment. Indictments don't have proceedings.

More to point, Trump can be impeached for *any reason* -- for something illegal *and* for something legal, too.

That's because impeachment is a political process, not a criminal process. That's why there are no criminal punishments if the impeachment is successful; it's simply about removing the official from office. That's why an impeachment cannot be stopped by a court or appealed. It is an ""extra-legal"" process, a lawyerly way to say it's a process outside the judicial system.

""But what about the high crimes and misdemeanors language in the Constitution?"" you may be asking.

That is an archaic phrase from common law and does not literally mean an official must commit a crime or misdemeanor. An earlier constitutional draft included the phrase ""maladministration"" but the more commonly understood (at the time) phrase of crimes and misdemeanors was a late substitution.

As the Constitutional Rights Foundation says, [""on first hearing this phrase, many people probably think that it is just an 18th century way of saying 'felonies and misdemeanors.' Felonies are major crimes and misdemeanors are lesser crimes. If this interpretation were correct, 'high crimes and misdemeanors' would simply mean any crime. But this interpretation is mistaken.""](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html)

The phrase dates from the fourteenth century and, as the linked page explains, was used for actions that were both illegal and legal. In the United States, Congress has impeached and removed officials from office for ""being habitually drunk,"" even though that is not a crime.

Hence, the House of Representatives could impeach Trump for any reason they want, even if some or all of those reasons don't involve violations of the law. They could impeach him because he demeans the presidency, he demeans the country, he divides the populace, his behavior is intemperate, and/or his conduct is unbecoming of a President -- whatever the reason -- they have every right to impeach him for that and more.

Thus, they could impeach Trump for his pardon of Joe Arpaio, even if that is a legal act. They could impeach him for trying to stop Robert Mueller's investigations into his campaign, the Russian scandal, and more, even if such actions would not be considered sufficient enough to be criminal obstruction of justice.



"
1138,89dmy7,"Uhg... He was impeachable under the Emoulments clause the day he entered office. 

Congress has to actually want to impeach."
1139,89dmy7,"He doesn't actually have to commit a crime.

They could draw up articles of impeachment because he puts his pants on left leg first if they wanted to. It just wouldn't make it very far in the process.

"
1140,89dmy7,"Under the federal constitution, no officer can be impeached unless for ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" No impeachment proceeding in the US has ever been reviewed by a federal court, so we don't actually have any case law that says what this phrase means. It's important to understand, however, that at the time the federal constitution was adopted, the US criminal code didn't exist, so it can't be the case that the founding fathers wished to limit impeachment to those circumstances where the official committed a violation of this code. Rather, the best understanding of this phrase is that it refers to abuse of power, gross dereliction of duty, or misconduct that, due to its very nature, can only be committed by someone in a position of power (""high"" means great or elevated). So, to use Nixon as an example, firing someone who you have the authority to fire for the purposes of stopping an investigation of yourself. It's allowed, but clearly violates a fundamental, valuable principle that no man, not even the President, is above the law.

If it sounds very fuzzy, that's because impeachment is properly understood as a political proceeding with a quasi-legal veneer."
1141,89dmy7,You can be impeached for any reason or no reason at all. You don’t have to commit a crime.
1142,89dmy7,"NVM the fact that impeaching him doesn't necessarily mean we'll get rid of him.  Clinton was impeached, for example."
1143,89dmy7,"> Impeachment proceedings can only be started if he has committed a crime

Impeachment can occur at any time congress feels like it. "
1144,89dmy7,"That's not really true though, right? There's no way to appeal being impeached. So they could vote to start impeachment proceedings for no reason, but as long as they eventually voted to convict, you're impeached and there's nothing you can do about it.

Anyway, Mueller appears to be building a case that Donald obstructed justice."
1145,89dmy7,"**Impeachment**

Impeachment is the process by which a legislative body formally levels charges against a high official of government. Impeachment does not necessarily mean removal from office; it is only a formal statement of charges, akin to an indictment in criminal law, and is thus only the first step towards removal. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote, which then entails the removal of the individual from office.

Because impeachment and conviction of officials involve an overturning of the normal constitutional procedures by which individuals achieve high office (election, ratification, or appointment) and because it generally requires a supermajority, they are usually reserved for those deemed to have committed serious abuses of their office.

You'd have to be either completely clueless or willfully stupid to pretend this is driven by anything other than him being mad at WaPo. 

Trump's entire political career is made up of him crowing on about deregulation and lowering taxes against big business. Outside of immigration, that's his entire goddamned platform.

And here he is talking about regulating and taxing *one specific business.* And that business just happens to be owned by the same guy who owns the Post? 

Given the way Trump acts...given his history of wanton vindictiveness....given his complete inability to let criticism against him just stand unanswered...yeah, you'd have to be a complete idiot to believe this isn't a directed attack against a media outlet. 

The fact that it's working to some extent...that Amazon's stocks are taking a hit...that's precisely why he's keeping it up. I don't think for one second that Trump is going to push for any legislation or even any kind of action on this issue. He won't try to tax Amazon. He won't try to regulate them. He won't try to change their relationship with USPS. What he *will* do is continue to tweet about how super-totes-bad Amazon is, because again...it's getting him the results he wants. He's hurting Bezos in the pocketbook. 

I doubt WaPo is going to give a shit though. "

Speaking anecdotally, a lot of my American friends absolutely *bristle* at any criticism or notion that America is less than perfect.

So, of course, you're right that we can't tell people ""they're terrible"". But the first step, imo, would be for **far more** Americans to start actually analyzing and considering the problems with their democracy/system and how to actually solve it without devolving into paranoid delusions or knee-jerk jingoism.

Edit: In fact, you almost did the exact thing that I described. It was said (my paraphrasing) ""It's time Americans start to realize that ""American"" isn't synonymous with ""good"".""

Your reaction was that ""[we can't] convince people to vote Trump out by telling them they're terrible people"" Ok.. but wait... *who said Americans are terrible people*? All that was said was the ""American"" isn't universally synonymous with ""good"".

I have no doubt that your comment had great intentions, but it almost perfectly fell back into the knee-jerk defense that I see from Americans all the time."
1212,89dmy7,"The problem is that it was the blind jingoistic unfounded ""America No 1"" crap that got the US into this mess in the first place.

Trump isn’t against Amazon for being a bad company. Him and the GOP *love* bad companies. Trump is against Amazon because Bezos has the nerve to allow WaPo to print the truth about him."

1382,5r5c79,"Well most states require some sort of permanent residence... Which isn't possible In multiple states.

While you are likely right about it not being criminal, this is one of the biggest gaps in voter registration and one of the only ways a person could theoretically vote twice and have both ballots counted.  "

1387,5r5c79,"The whole point is that is the basis behind the exaggerated voter ""fraud"" claims. These reports are more of *a status of the voting system* overview and the low-hanging fruit recommendation is to manage registration better so you can't be registered in more than one state as it's an obvious way to reduce the potential for voter fraud.  Anytime anyone actually checks if fraud occurs from multiple registrations though, it always comes up with no fraud, likely because it's obvious and stupid."

1400,5r5c79,"That's correct, but wasn't it Trump himself who said something along those lines?"
1401,5r5c79,"But with so many States having early voting, it's soooo easy to do.  Ask yourself honestly...would Republicans cheat to win?"
1402,5r5c79,Accurate reporting too confronting?
1403,5r5c79,"As a rule, states have been hesitant to clean voter rolls for a few reasons.  Firstly, it has been used in the past as a tactic to disenfranchise 'undesired' voters by whomever was in power (pick a party).  You can put a process in place for getting back on the list of eligible voters, but draconian processes have been used in the past to dissuade people from going through the effort of getting back on.   

Second. If you do clean up the voter rolls, the people in power, ie they that ordered the clean up, don't want to look responsible for keeping Grandma from voting when she is accidentally kicked off the list of eligible voters.  Looks bad, pisses people off.

Third, it gets a lot of attention from outside groups and regulators, creating headaches for administrations people really would rather not go through for a limited return on effort, time, and keyly money.

Lastly, organized voter fraud has not been a problem in the US for generations.  So all the headaches above are hard to justify to your constituents and eats up time when you could be working on a legislative agenda or the grind of running a state.

**TL;DR**

Cleaning voter rolls was used as a tactic in the past to disenfranchise the opposition.  As such, it draws a lot of scrutiny, is administratively hard to do, and the kinds of voter fraud it addresses hasn't been a serious issue that could threaten the integrity of an election.  Little return on your efforts and a drain on political capital.

*EDIT: lots of spelling and grammar corrections from my 3am comment.  Sorry about all that.  Thanks to /u/jurph for adding clarification and the proper spelling of ""rolls"" vs ""roles"" as I had written.*"

1409,5r5c79,Wrong. Do research. I am registered in 3 states because I moved a lot a few years ago. This has nothing to do with voter fraud.
1410,5r5c79,Trump said though he will also investigate those registered in multiple states.
1411,5r5c79,What's the incentive?  You're actually frightened that a substantive amount of voters went out of their way to vote multiple times without any central organization to push them to do it and it was so many for one side it actually changed the election?  This is all BS that Trump brought up because he's embarrassed he lost the popular vote.

Look - we can't have it both ways, people. Either voting should be really accessible to everyone with the risk of fraud or it should require an ID which will disenfranchise the poor.

It's like free speech. If you want free speech, you're going to have to tolerate abuse. If you abridge free speech, you might be silencing the next MLK. "

For example, here's [North Carolina] (https://vt.ncsbe.gov/voter_search_public/) just pick someone and you can search them. I'd assume that police and perhaps the FBI have easy access to the databases. With these tools finding people who vote more than once is going to be rather easy."

1437,5r5c79,"maybe, the man sure says a lot. "
1438,5r5c79,the answer is probably yes.  I'm fairly anti-gop establishment for many reasons.  The most important thing is if there is voter fraud going on it should be stopped regardless of party affiliation of the offenders. 
1439,5r5c79,Just more US political bullshit I need to filter out. 
1440,5r5c79,"Two quick things: 

1. It's ""rolls"".
2. Doing *any* management of large lists is inherently error-prone, and so all you can do is choose what kind of error you're going to get: false positives (voters removed unjustly) or false negatives (voters incorrectly left on the rolls who probably won't vote).  

A good rule of thumb is that you'll get between 90% and 99% of the list right with a few quick passes -- the most common mistakes are things like ""We have a notification of death that includes last known address; they match a registered voter with the same DOB"".  You can safely remove that dead voter.  But what if the address matches and the DOB doesn't?  If you remove the voter, you might later find out it's a son/daughter/etc. who has the same name.  

Anyone who's ever had to do a property inventory or other large-list management will have plenty of stories about how much time and effort goes into the last 1% of every list.  If that time and effort were spent mobilizing voters or registering voters, the additional turnout would dwarf any potential fraud from the variance on the rolls.  "

1442,5r5c79,"The state I moved from (the last two addresses) thanks to our wonderful governor (who cut the funding from my university by hundreds of millions of dollars to run an ill-fated run for president where he embarrassed me and my state, failed spectacularly, and made another program in another state very attractive) enacted Voter ID laws and it made the processes to register more difficult, but also the process to de-register.

Within the state it isn't so difficult, but leave the state and there are extra steps. I could do it, but why bother when it isn't illegal to just not and remember not to vote in a city 500 miles from me?"

1446,5r5c79,Nah trump is no Nixon. Nixon was our best policy president. He was a terrible people's president though. He was a guy who was 3 steps ahead. Had Watergate never gotten uncovered or uncovered many years after his presidency he would be remember much more fondly than his peers. Probably I bit higher than Eisenhower.
1447,5r5c79,But he has direct family who are registered in more than one state? I could be wrong but I mean...
1448,5r5c79,"It's more than that Trump called it out. Trump specifically cites this as proof of voter fraud. 

When he uses the 3 million number, he is saying that **100% of people** that are registered in more than one state cast a vote fraudulently in the election (not to mention the even more retarded idea that 100% of those votes were fraudulently cast against Trump). That would include this person that he is using as a source for the election fraud number in the first place. So either Trump is using a source that is lying, or this source directly participated in the largest case voter fraud in US history (not to mention voted against Trump 3 times) and in a way that had no effect on the outcome of the race anyway.

That is literally the logic these fucking dipshits are using."

It's the age old adage of if you make a mistake don't act like you've made a mistake and people are less likely to notice. Lucky for him and his supporters, the media lately has been complete pussies and haven't been calling him out as fervently and loudly as they should. Plus there's the issue that the media that is likely to call him out are already labeled as the ""dirty, fake, liberal media."" Trump isn't an idiot. He's playing the game beautifully for his own position. He's known that he would contradict himself and do shit people on the other side would hate. So he started attacking the media from the beginning, setting them up as his ultimate enemy that was out to get him. It's pure planned propaganda. His followers ate it up, now there is an ingrained hatred against the media.

I think this is representative of misconceptions around the issues.

A state issued ID issued ID is free many places, or is equal equal cost to an hour at minimum wage at most in the other places. It is also law in many states that if you are on government asistance this would allow for a voucher, not to mention just about any church would whole heatedly give you enough to cover one if you went in and explained the situation earnestly. The fees in the states that have them are more so you don't waste resources by being irresponsible and losing yor ID every other week.

I guarantee there is almost no reason you could not financially obtain one. Not to mention it is something you have years to renew and can do so at any time.

But here's the thing about your scenario. Voter impersonation only works if you know the voter you're impersonating exceedingly well. Imagine in the next election someone tries to vote in your place. When you show up to vote the rolls say you already voted. So, you raise hell, show the officer guarding the polling place your ID and then they launch an investigation. Odds are they'll never catch the perpetrator, but at the very least it's an easily recorded case of actual voter fraud. Even if they let you vote because they are keeping paper records, at some later point it's going to be discovered that you voted twice. The fact is that voter fraud of this nature is exceedingly easy to detect. So in order to pull it off without being detected you need to know in every single case that the person whose vote you're stealing is definitely not showing up to vote. (By the way, it's also super easy to detect votes cast by people who died before election day.) Now, try to scale this up to 10 people without ever being detected and you'll see why the fact that there have been 31 credible cases of voter fraud since 2000 shows that voter fraud is not a real problem.

He also cited this clown, greg phillips, who claims that there is *conclusively* millions of instances voter fraud, but couldn't offer proof because he didn't understand the difference between a theory and a conclusion.

So, technically, you are correct that Trump has never directly said that being registered in multiple states is voter fraud, however, he has clearly gone out of his way to make his followers think that this is somehow out of the ordinary or in support of what he's claiming, which is pretty fucking shitty.

Since the guy himself is registered in 3 states, it just shows how badly Trump is talking out his ass on this one.

>2. Voter ID laws typically require a potential voter to obtain an ID from a specific location or set of locations, in some cases that may be dozens of miles away (in the case of Texas, some people have to travel >100 miles). This is problematic if the person cannot drive and no transportation is available to them (elderly and rural poor), and also difficult for people that have jobs that do not give them time off to do so.

>3. Voter ID laws require documentation that may be difficult to obtain and is typically not available free of charge.

Beyond that, when voter ID laws are instituted, we often see concerted efforts to shut down places that process them in disproportionately minority areas, raising the barrier to access presented in Point 2 above.

FWIW I support voter ID laws if they're done the same way they're done in a place like, say, India, where ID can be applied for and processed via mail or internet, and the entire process is free of charge to prevent a poll tax-like situation. No reason not to do it if easy and free access is guaranteed. "

You seem to have a lot of insider knowledge about the evidence the federal government has into an investigation about voter fraud, what branch of government do you work in? 

And in what possible way is voter ID a method to suppress the votes of poor people? If Mexico can do it, we can do it. If India can do it, we can do it. There is literally 0 reason to oppose voter ID, but the democrats do it anyway. Why? Because they rely on voter fraud. All I have to do in California to register to vote is click a checkmate next to ""are you an American citizen"" on an online signup sheet with no validation process. Project Veritas showed that there is voter fraud happening and that they've been doing it for years. To claim that the only evidence they have is ""people registered in two states"" is bull shit, right along with their reasoning being it's ""to suppress poor people"". Give me a break. "

1517,5r5c79,"interesting that you resort to calling that user names, especially when you have no idea what you're talking about.  

Most attempts at strict voter ID laws are designed specifically to make it difficult for minorities to vote. 

What happens is, They try to make laws making identification requirements much stricter while at the same time make it harder for people to get these ID's, sometimes it's already difficult enough that all they don't even have to make it harder to get, they just increase ID requirements. 

Minorities will often have less time to go through all the hoops required with these new voter ID laws, as they are more likely to have lower paying jobs which usually means they work more hours, or single moms  may not be able to spare the time or pay for child care. 

There are many other reasons why Voting ID laws affect minorities negatively, if you researched this subject even a little you would know that. 

If Republicans pushed to fund the creation of a national or even state  Voter ID and made it simpler and easier to get from a bureaucratic point of view, then i would say that indeed, it was just about voter fraud, but the reality is all these voter ID laws are designed to discourage minorities(who mostly vote Democrat)  from voting.

As I said too, not being religious but have done charity work with them, you would be hard pressed to find a place of worship that would deny giving you the $10 if you explained your ID situation to them.

2. I find it hard to believe there are people who cannot get a ride year round, but can make it to the polling place that one specific day of the year to vote. In addition the rural poor an elderly being far away from services to obtain an ID goes against the belief that the republicans are attempting to deny votes. Those people are their base. It doesn't make sense to actively deny those specific demographics voting rights, if that's the argument anyhow.

3. While some documents may be hard to obtain may be harder to acquire, getting a plain photo ID is relatively simple. A letter adressed to you, documents with your birthday and social security number are all that is needed. Given the required documentation that is needed for just primary school alone for decades, you would have to be raised more or less off the grid, with no medical care or use of money to be in this situation. Even the few people raised before documentation was stringent  would have to have been more or less recluses their entire lives, and have refected things like social security and banking.

I agree that getting the required ID should be free and easy. But the argument based on cost prohibitive voting denial just doesn't seem an issue. Examples are generally fringe theoretical cases are presented. Any cases I have seen are generally people who did make it a priority to register themselves to vote.  If the process were made perfect these are the people who would say that they should be able to vote after election day, after seeing the results, because they couldn't be bothered.

I mean given a perfect system, people would start claiming they were denied voting rights because they did not have the time to mail in post card to get their voter ID.

If he wanted to make a true investigation, he would *quietly* find a 3rd party investigator with no stake in the claim - not this Greg phillips idiot who can't even speak for 3 minutes on TV without letting his personal biases out in spectacularly moronic fashion, and not purposely fanning flames of hysteria among his voters to cast doubt on the democratic process and to stroke his own ego.  The US has already investigated many times the possibility of voter fraud from unbiased sources.  The reason THIS case has caused such resistance is not because people are ""afraid it's true"".  It's because the parties who are conducting the investigation have made it clear that they KNOW what the result will be and are seeking only to VERIFY it.  The issue with this is that when you have something to gain from one of the results of the investigation, it's impossible to actually conduct an unbiased investigation.  I know, typical liberals insisting upon proper investigative practices when voting rights are on the line. 

The complaint about voter IDs is that they will end up costing money.  They will ask that people take more time off of work to go get them.  They will likely make them take as long as possible to fill out paperwork etc.  You may think that's not a big deal, but that is a much larger inconvenience for people with lower income than it is for people who earn more.  Trump benefits from this.

I'm also in California, and I also registered online, so I know that what you are saying about simply clicking a bubble is actually total BS.  It's not an incredibly involved process of going and waiting in a line and paying extra fees unnecessarily like it is in many states, but they still ask you to provide a valid driver's license, the last 4 digits of your social security number, and a name and address.  All of these are checked against eachother to make sure they match a registered citizen.  It's very possible there are isolated instances of people using someone else's ID, but it's impossible to vote twice, and it's impossible to vote if you don't have the credentials of an actual citizen (unless they were to steal someone else's identity).  Certainly not up in the millions of illegal voters.  

Also, laughable that you even mention project veritas as some sort of evidence.  Those guys have been shown multiple times to have doctored footage and stoop to insanely unethical levels to conduct their ""investigations"".  Most recently, they were caught on film attempting to bribe progressives to start a riot at Trump's inauguration.  This is well known, and this is the reason Donald Trump isn't sitting on ABC news saying ""You know James O'keefe?  Yeah, that guy totally proved what I'm saying is right."" - because he would get torn apart immediately.  It would only give him more public attention which would further discredit him.

So you say all of this with absolute conviction, but you've provided a straight up falsehood and evidence from a known fraudster to support your points, so... again you're back to nothing.  Can you provide anything of substance while you tell me what I'm saying is bullshit?

1535,5r5c79,There isn't even anything to take literally. He has two statements they are looking into voter fraud and there are many people registered in multiple states. He never states being registered in multiple states = voter fraud. That is the mental gymnastics of the average redditor.

1539,5r5c79,"For one, any ""investigation"" set up by the Trump administration will be a sham. Any results it'd report would be staggeringly partisan. And since voting laws are well established by law to be states rights issues, all Trump would do with it is use it as propaganda to say how terrible all those liberal states are.

1542,5r5c79,You know why that's wrong
1543,5r5c79,Is there a single piece of credible evidence that this isn't already the case? The risk of getting caught is not worth a single vote.
1544,5r5c79,Funny how the requirements to win revolved around the electoral college from the start so it's not like it was a surprise that would be how a winner was determined 
1545,5r5c79,"No, it wasn't JUST the electoral college system that cost the vote, that's oversimplification. It was a culmination of a lot of different factors that caused it, just a few off the top of my head:

- The handling of the email controversy
- The handling of paid speeches and not releasing transcripts
- Bernie or bust
- media spotlight on Trump
- calling half the population deplorables
- Hilary being, frankly, a bad candidate with too many flaws to pick out.

Any change or difference in damage control could have swung a point or two, but all of this formed into a death ball that put Trump into power. Saying that it was just the electoral college takes away the whole year of campaigning that was done.

And before you rifle through my post history, I do not live in the US And I wouldn't support Trump if I did."
1546,5r5c79,"Oh I'm sorry, i didn't realize it was fucking illegal to have an opinion in a democracy

1548,5r5c79,I agree
1549,5r5c79,"..2. What does it matter if the voter is democrat or republican? It is unfair to the individual. It is odd you brought that up.

You think there are no people who cannot make it to vote because of their circumstances? Do you think doubling the burden would help or hinder this situation?

If you double up the burden, will no people go from being able to just manage to vote, to being no longer able to do so?

It is nice that we are sure this doesn't occur and wouldn't occur."
1550,5r5c79,"Why not just use a social security number as a voter ID since ostensibly every citizen has one? A computer could easily check it against a government database on-site at polling locations to make sure you are who you say you are, that you are not deceased, and that you have not already voted. If the Photo is the sticking point, that's easily remedied by using the photo locations in US post offices to submit a photo to a government database. They're already set up to handle it, as this is one of the primary ways people get their photos for a passport. Allowing a photo to be submitted by mail would also work, and is currently good enough for passports as well. This would remove the burden of the state having to issue a whole separate card.

Polling can currently be done by mail, many elderly and disabled folks do this, so transportation is not a legitimate factor when considering travel for voting purposes."

>People have to get driver's licenses no?

Surprise, but not everyone owns a car.  In fact, a large percentage of people in the inner city don't own cars.  And when you have places like North Carolina and Alabama specifically closing offices in low income areas, means that just to register to vote take a large chunk of time  (in the middle of work hours, no less, so they have to take time off of work).  

But, you're right, because it's how you feel, not facts, that matter. Reality doesn't fit your narrative?  That's cool.  Ignore it and stay in your own little bubble."

You obviously didn't even bother to read anything i linked to, not surprised  as you seem like someone who has no interest in educating themselves, especially if it contradict your world view. 

all you have is your assumption on what people can do and personal attacks, also your claims of being a minority and using that as some kind of proof of anything don't mean shit, I've seen plenty of times where users claim to be a minority and that they agree with some insane conservative narrative only to go through their history and see that they're white, often they're even white supremacists,  not that I'm  saying you're not a minority, but your personal experience doesn't invalidate the majorities experience. 

here's two examples when Courts ruled Voter ID laws illegal, it's not just a fantasy of mine, this is real life. 

[A federal appeals court struck down North Carolina’s voter ID law on Friday, finding that a series of provisions approved by lawmakers in 2013 were “enacted with racially discriminatory intent.”](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/nc-voter-id-law-discriminatory-appeals-court/) 

[Texas’ voter identification law violates the U.S. law prohibiting racial discrimination in elections, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.](https://www.texastribune.org/2016/07/20/appeals-court-rules-texas-voter-id/)

That's why Trump is ordering an investigation into voter fraud! And suddenly the dems are saying there is no voter fraud, even when Jill Stein herself crowdfunded to recount 3 states to look for election fraud, and only found more votes for Trump! See how strange that is?

So just to be clear, you concede you were wrong? Why did you believe it was illegal?"
1576,5r5c79,"I made a comment above that addresses the racist aspect. As far as not jumping to conclusions and having a discussion, I am afraid that the right (who is obviously being fueled by an honest-to-god right wing core right now) has pulled the conversation so far to the right that it has literally given us the phrase, ""alternative facts"". You can't have a discussion about *anything* if you are not going to allow objective facts to be the basis of a policy discussion. 

Think about how far to the right the American so-called ""center"" is. The largest socialist program in like, 30 years at least, has been Obamacare. Which is almost unrecognizable as something on the socialist continuum. It isn't single-payer, national healthcare, which is now the norm for developed nations. Look around worldwide, how is our current republican party different from any far-right political party that is currently surging in Europe?

The left is *barely* hanging on as a centrist political party since the 90s. I don't think they have been the ones assuming the extreme stances."
1577,5r5c79,"The whole ""any opposition is calling people nazis"" is a deflection and ignores the honest complaints that what is happening in America right now is wrong."
1578,5r5c79,I've found just trying to get some dialogue on their personal thoughts is met with defensiveness. I think this is even from moderates who try to see both sides. It's as if having any opinion at all is navigating some mine field. It's getting pretty bad. 
1579,5r5c79,"Actually, I think a case can be made for that. Hear me out.

If one is willing to overlook or disregard the xenophobic and racist rhetoric coming from the people currently inhabiting the white house, then I submit that such a person is, whether they know it or not, racist.

I think that the disconnect arises because conservatives think that you have to be dragging minorities behind a pickup truck or wearing bed sheets to be a ""real racist"", and when the overwhelming majority of people who enable or perpetrate racism don't do those things it *feels* unfair to be called a racist. It is this limited view of what constitutes racism that is the problem.

This is also precisely the mindset exploited by the GOP. Voter registration isn't racist because it doesn't mention black people explicitly. The rhetoric of ""school choice"" to divert money away from public schools isn't racist because it doesn't mention black people explicitly. Predatory lending isn't racist because it doesn't mention black people explicitly, et cetera. It is a broader view of the term racism than most white people have ever considered.

When a group of white people think their economic insecurity is more urgent than the multiple social challenges facing people of color in America (in addition to their own well-documented economic insecurity) it is racist."
1580,5r5c79,"And there is 0 evidence to say that it won't be. He's squeaked through the election with an EC win from people not turning out and he's already making a complete pigs ear of it.

1584,5r5c79,Considering half the country doesn't vote the popular vote doesn't mean much. Its a poor argument to say that the popular vote from the elections shows what the people want.

1695,6yigso,"Based on his approval ratings, the ongoing FBI investigation, and the total lack of transparency from Donald Trump's White House I doubt he'll be in office in 3 years. Feasibly it could be a Pence achievement, that I could see."

1697,6yigso,"He picked a judge's name from a list somebody else prepared after Congress stonewalled for a year and claims it as a major achievement.  If it goes well, he'll claim it.  If it is a catastrophe, it's those other people's mistakes."

1718,6yigso,"Not really.  What should they have done with the body?  Any place they took the body would of been a target for attack. If they left the body it would of been used in propaganda videos made by the other terrorists. 

"
1719,6yigso,"Congress had a chance to create the law. The GOP and 5 Dems killed it. 

When Trump hands Israeli intel to the Russians, it's cool because he has the executive authority to declassify documents. 

But when Obama does anything, it's executive overreach. 

There is a double standard with these Presidents it seems. "
1720,6yigso,"Congress currently has an almost 80% disapproval rating. So with that track record I doubt to see any, ""win"" that satisfies both sides. 

Sorry, but Trump flip flops too much on a lot of issues.

He was a pretty unknown senator at the time, and he rose due to populism and charisma. Obama caved into the establishment, so people chose a more extreme anti-establishment candidate (had two options in Sanders and Trump, but Trump was more outsider than Sanders).

1906,6yigso,">Giving $1M of his own money

This is where you are wrong. He said he would give money to Harvey victims (12 organization, one of which has ties to Trump), but he didn't and he won't, because fuck them, why would he? You can not trust this man's words, but he is POTUS. I'd be nice to have an american president whose words actually mean anything, because at this point you can safely ignore anything Trump says and focus on his actions, which are terrible.

And if he magically decides to actually give the money (remember he is an alleged billionaire, 1 million is supposedly peanuts for him) away (which he is absolutely not known for), I will still be unhappy, because he funneled a bigly larger amount of tax payer's dollarinos into his hotels, so he still made a profit by simply abusing the presidency - those millions (**your money**) would have been great for disaster relief, tbh, but they are probably either funding his campaign rallies (this early?) or his businesses. For every decently sounding action of him, there is a whole pile of shit-context to put it in, maybe that's why people dislike him, I guess °_°"
1907,6yigso,When did he give that money?
1908,6yigso,"Donald Trump has a longstanding history of _saying_ that he's giving/given money to charity. Unfortunately, and I know this is going to come as a shock, he often lies. 

David Fahrenthold at The Washington Post called all of the places on the list of charities Trump has claimed to give to. For the most part they say that he's not given them _anything_.

Here's a link to the responses:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/trump-charity-donations/

I count **250** places that Trump has claimed to have donated to that say he's lying. Another 64 that didn't respond and another 100 that refused to say. Judging by the other 300 places on the list I'm going to say the 100 that refused to say just didn't want to anger the president.

I'll believe that Donald Trump has donated to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts when every charity that he claims to be donating to issues a formal statement saying that they've received the money."

1955,6yigso,"It's not obviously going to be yes.

Imagine how much heat Obama would have taken if the entire SEAL team was killed and UBL got away and gloated about it? Hung our soldiers' heads on pikes? It would have been a disaster. 

Thank goodness the intel was solid and it was more of a chateau than a military compound. Plus the SEALs are badass motherfuckers. 

But Obama had the responsibility to make the call. Just Cheeto Benito does now. 

Imagine if he fucks up a disaster because he was mad at the gay brother from Modern Family?

Or staring at his own daughter's tits?"
1956,6yigso,"These are pretty good reasons.


I would also add that he's a narcissistic, self-centered, sexist, racist, bigoted asshole on a lifelong powertrip and he's clueless on international relations.

What about roasting Obama for golfing and wasting taxpayer's money only to fucking do the same thing at a much higher rate even.

Said that global warming was a chinese hoax on twitter.

Mocked a disabled reporter (I once actually believed those trump supporting cunts who said it was ""debunked"", but that is not true, he did mock a disabled just to be be an asshole. 

Kept a book of Hitler speeches by his bedside (Okay, this one might not be true because it was according his ex or something, but still would not shock if it was).

Called mexicans rapists and said they were bringing in drugs. That was just sick and pointless thing to say.

Who can forget THE WALL, a shity idea that would cost a fuckton to build and even more to maintain.

That bullshit tweet of his about a terrorist attack that happened ""last night in sweden"" which was actually if i remember correctly a small riot somewhere in sweden, not a terrorist attack.

He is essentially stealing from Peter and Paul to pay himself."
1959,6yigso,"I don't really have an opinion on global warming, but you seem to be unable to challenge ""your"" beliefs.

The debate isn't about whether or not global warming is real or not, it's about if it's due to human activity.

NASA says it's 95% likely to be the result of human activity.

ICSC says human activity has no impact on global warming. 

https://climatechange.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=001445

There's a lot of shaming going on on the issue of global warming. You even included some shaming yourself ""Fuck you, you're brain dead"", like you're afraid of being wrong. When this happens people who believe ICSC's studies go silent, which makes it seem like people who believe the NASA studies are right.

Don't forget, disagreements are a good thing. It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong on most things as long as you take everything into account and at least try to form your own opinion. Open your mind for new possibilities. Challenge everything you believe in. Question everything you care about. Don't be robot who can't think for itself."

So, it is possible the money is coming from him, I apologize for the confusion.  I'm still skeptical, though.  I guess we will wait and see.  I'm sure he's made a lot more than a million since being president, so maybe, it's possible."

Many of those original ""foot soldiers"" joined him yesterday, including **Congressman John Lewis**, who helped to organize the first march over this bridge in 1965, who endured a tragic beating on that ""Bloody Sunday,"" and who yesterday strode arm in arm with the President of the United States.

2076,7wqnk6,Hah! I thought that was just me. I started looking for all the dudes in grey/black suits and sunglasses.
2077,7wqnk6,Why is it that the secret service make themselves so easy to spot? Doesn't that in a way defeat their purpose? 
2078,7wqnk6,I spot 8 maybe 10 if you count the old ladies in the wheelchair 
2079,7wqnk6,2nd from Obama to his right.
2080,7wqnk6,Counted 16 and then I gave up.

2083,7wqnk6,"> Congressman John Lewis

The same John Lewis that was criticized by the Trump administration for not honoring civil rights leaders... i.e. himself.

"
2084,7wqnk6,"Check out the new Letterman show on Netflix. The first episode includes interviews with both Obama and Lewis. A lot of insight on Bloody Sunday. And it’ll make you miss the shit out of Obama...*Thanks*, Obama."
2085,7wqnk6,Check out the (graphic novel) book March that John Lewis wrote with Andrew Aydin illustrated by Nate Powell. It should be mandatory reading at all US schools
2086,7wqnk6,who are the white dudes?
2087,7wqnk6,...lady in the wheelchair
2088,7wqnk6,"That guy to the left and behind M. Obama isnt a member of the secret service, thats the Terminator!"
2089,7wqnk6,"True the look shouldn't matter too much unless they got green skin and bug eyes because if that happened then zip zoop and before you know it you've got an extraterrestrial as commander in chief and tbh they probably couldn't relate much to the average citizen, I mean, look at what happened in Denmark when Xyböslian III was in charge lol no thank uuuuuuuuuuuu"
2090,7wqnk6,that's probably what OP was implying....
2091,7wqnk6,"In that they are not fictitious and hold a title of president, yes"
2092,7wqnk6,[deleted]
2093,7wqnk6,"George Bush was there mate, this wasn't an all black parade.

Not to mention that the point was to honor MLK, not to say anyone is better than any other.

 But, I will sneak in some of that and say Obama is better than Trump, in every way imaginable."
2094,7wqnk6,"There are plenty of white people in this parade. He's holding his family, something Trump doesn't even do unless it's his hot daughter. You missed the point "
2095,7wqnk6,So you think there is nothing worth celebrating there?
2096,7wqnk6,"It's gonna be a short lived record

2097,7wqnk6,"Think its just cause drones were new?

Truman has the most kills by atom bomb. "
2098,7wqnk6,"I'm always curious about this complaint - would you rather he sent fighter pilots in to do the same things drones did instead? He inherited the wars he fought and the drones he used, is his choice to adopt the technology of the age over putting soldiers in danger the issue here? If Bush had the drones Obama had he would have droned a hell of a lot more people than Obama did, and Trump in a year is already crushing Obama's numbers over 8.  "
2099,7wqnk6,Also holds the record for most Nobel prize winners bombed by a Nobel prize winner. 
2100,7wqnk6,I can't imagine any other president having a kill score. /s
2101,7wqnk6,all presidents matter
2102,7wqnk6,"Not only is everyone who has been President a real President, I recon anything they do is presidential. Their actions define what is presidential, not our expectations. There's something fucked up about it, when people say that's 'un x' right after x has just done it."
2103,7wqnk6,"Yeah, in name maybe"
2104,7wqnk6,"so, so much.
i get frustrated thinking about what (more) he could have done if he hadn't faced the most obstructionist shithole of a congress ever."

2110,7wqnk6,"Everyone knows Trump won the presidential election.

And everyone knows what a joke of a president he's been ever since.  An embarrasment to the office and the country."
2111,7wqnk6,“Won”

Why are you disagreeing with Trump? 

You're gonna be kicked out of the_donald for disagreeing with your Orange Lord."

I just don’t have that level of trust in our current administration. It worries me when laws are changed just to undo what Obama did. Does he think it’s good decision making or is he being petty? "
2119,7wqnk6,"It is telling that all of your positives for Obama are related to his personality, not things he achieved. "
2120,7wqnk6,"Such charisma. I like how he could sell guns to cartels in a country with strict gun control and make me feel like it was a great idea. Then he'd give a speech about how America needs more gun control, and he'd make me feel like that's a great idea too. Then he legalized propaganda, suspended habeus corpus and bombed some hospitals. All great ideas because he was so well spoken and articulate."

But his list of dangerous, evil and stupid things he did in all his terms looks pityful against what the current president is putting together. "
2127,7wqnk6,"Yeah, that's one thing that I didn't particularly like about the Obama administration. Also how we basically said ""fuck you"" to Pakistan and killed Bin Laden, fuck any progress we made in that region because ""lol we got em"""

What would Trump have done, if he was pres at that time? The same thing. Learn some perspective, christ.

2133,7wqnk6,You aren’t looking at a picture of attention seeking losers stuck in the past. You are looking at a group of Americans who were treated unfairly by an imbalanced power structure and took diplomatic action to help correct that imbalance. You don’t see groups of poor oppressed white people doing this because they are too busy identifying with the wealthy oppressors. They treat this like a team sport to be won or lost.

2137,7wqnk6,"but, fuk he was so0o0o charismatic. "
2138,7wqnk6,"Fuck no he didn't he made it all worse.

If you really want to help black people in the US first thing you need to do is stop feeling sorry for them and them and help them fix their communities. They are poor communities, they make babies, babies get born into poverty, don't know any better, grow up and the cycle goes on. 

If anything Obama made things worse by talking about how hard they have and acting like they don't have to do anything and we just have to fix the white devils racism and all poverty and racial income division will just go away."
2139,7wqnk6,"he didnt even really do that. If he wanted to lift blacks out of the abyss, he would have worked harder to legalize pot. Pot Prohibition is one of the greatest tools of oppression there is in America."

2144,7wqnk6,It’s really......SAD!
2145,7wqnk6,You know half the country voted for President Trump?
2146,7wqnk6,"Who then went from [bombing 2 countries to 7.......](https://youtu.be/i3oIB13C5pc)

2149,7wqnk6,"Yeah I definitely feel richer after Obama turned the economy around. Anyone remember the 2008 financial crisis? Any of you guys can imagine where we’d be if Trump was president? Anyone? No?

The wealth gap is only increasing because the increase in your paycheck is nothing compared to the tax cuts the richer folks are getting.

EDIT:  Got a response in the form of a PM from /u/otterom.  For some reason they didn't have the nerves to respond to the comment itself...

Sad little Trump supporters..."
2153,7wqnk6,"Only caring about money is what got us the current piece of shit president we have now. But what do I know, except that I don’t go into sub Reddits that I don’t support just throw out boring counter points and waste my fucking time."
2154,7wqnk6,I felt richer while on Obama was in office.  We are continuing to ride the economic wave he set us up for.  To think Trump and republicans are solely responsible for this economic boom means you know very little about our economy.

With Trump, if he does something good, he will be spouting some nonsense in a matter of time that contradicts his actions leading to the impression that it was a PR stunt all along. "
2161,7wqnk6,Fuck would you know?
2162,7wqnk6,Exactly 
2163,7wqnk6,He didn’t exactly say “this is what a real president looks like and all of them that don’t look like this are fake presidents” so it’s really not that confusing. This is in fact a picture of a real president

Grover Cleveland, homie."
2165,7wqnk6,How is Trump worse in your opinion?
2166,7wqnk6,"Correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm from Europe. However, wasn't the main reason that he didn't do most of these things was because Republicans held control of Congress for most of his presidency?"

Do you have any leaders in your life? Are they positive people who fight for the rights of others who (in this case) literally can't stand up for themselves?

ISIS was pretty much destroyed by the time Trump came into office. “Bombing the shit out of them” is a bad policy plank - any U.S. action in the middle east needs to make sure to kill as few civilians as possible, so that we can actually make them trust us and not perpetuate the cycle of terrorism. We need to work with them, not against them. 

It’s kind of hilarious that T_D spent the whole election raging against Obama’s massive use of drones, and then Trump comes in and makes it way more reckless."

2235,7wqnk6,"It's not blind hatred. It's just that his failings are  often so blatant, and his behaviour so unconstitutional, that seeing the cult worship he gets from younger generations as well as the free pass on the media is just disturbing. 

How come no one on any news network brought up the question of Hezbollah drug networks in the US? Or gun sales to cartels? Or extrajudicial killings of US citizens with drones? The list goes on."
2236,7wqnk6,All presidents have a cvs receipts full of conspiracies and scandals to be completely honest
2237,7wqnk6,"Yeah, when it comes to middle eastern affairs Obama really didnt do a very good job. "
2238,7wqnk6,[deleted]
2239,7wqnk6,What about Syria and Lybia? And you think Obama never could have done anything to withdraw the troops in 8 years? This is a man who won the nobel peace prize. Learn some perspective.
2240,7wqnk6,Making racism great again! :)
2241,7wqnk6,He destroyed all the good will the U.S had with its allies and isolated us while simultaneously provoking everything around us.  Trump's biggest achievement so far is making America more vulnerable than it has been in a long time.
2242,7wqnk6,Why do you say that?
2243,7wqnk6,"He said something cool on a TV show once! Best president ever! Let me describe him using only completely meaningless and subjective attributes, so you can't technically prove me wrong because he doesn't really have anything of value to show for himself! Also if you disgaree you're racist. "

2245,7wqnk6,"What do you expect from the democratic mental slavery plantation. No one, not republicans and not democrats actually want blacks to do better. "

2261,7wqnk6,"Its fun to throw all those talking points out, but the truths behind those is more complex than you make it seem.

That's the unfortunate part about politics today.  You are an unfortunate byproduct of politics today."

2263,7wqnk6,Imagine believing this unironically
2264,7wqnk6,"Except when given the chance, Obama as president didn't do shit. He betrayed all the people that voted for him, he might not be as shitty as Trump, but he's still a war criminal that further extended American interventions."

2279,7wqnk6,"**Non sequitur (logic)**

A non sequitur (Latin for ""it does not follow""), in formal logic, is an invalid argument. In a non sequitur, the conclusion is either true or false, but the argument nonetheless asserts the conclusion to be true and is thus fallacious. While a logical argument is a non sequitur if, and only if, it is invalid, the term 'non sequitur' typically refers to those types of invalid arguments which do not constitute logical fallacies covered by particular terms (e.g. affirming the consequent).

The smartest thing he did was go from running as a democrat to a republican. He found a base much easier to fool and ran with it. All he had to do was repeat everything he heard on Fox News the night before and boom, he’s president.

2376,9eh6xn,"2018 Russia Investigation Current Tally:

Guilty By Trial: 
- Paul Manafort (Trump’s Political Consultant) (8 Charges) (10 Charges Mistrial)

Guilty By Federal Judge:
- Alex van der Zwann (Worked with Rick Gates and Paul Manafort) (1 Charge)

Plead Guilty:
- Michael Flynn (National Security Advisor) (1 Charge)
- Rick Gates (Trump’s Political Consultant) (2 Charges)
- Michael Cohen (Trump’s Personal Attorney/RNC Deputy Finance Chair) (8 Charges)
- George Papadopoulos (Member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Panel) (1 Charge)
- Samuel Patten (Associate of Paul Manafort and Cambridge Analytica) (1 Charge)

Plead Guilty (Wanted To, But Denied Guilty Plea):
- Paul Manafort (Tried getting guilty plea after his first trial (Found guilty on 8 charges while the 10 other charges are still ongoing). My opinion/guess is He was denied because Mueller’s team probably already knows what he was going to tell them.

Recused:
- Jeff Sessions (Attorney General)

Granted Immunity:
- David Pecker (CEO of National Enquirer/Trump’s friend) (Pecker claims there is a safe of decades of damaging stories of Trump. Rachel Maddow touched on how the National Enquirer repeatedly put out anti Hillary cover stories. “Control the medium, control the message.”)
- Allen Weisselberg (CFO of Trump Organization)
- Andrew Miller (Roger Stone’s Aide)

Granted Immunity (Manafort Trial):
- Donna Duggan (Moody Insurance Worldwide Employee)
- Conor O'Brien (Former KWC employee)
- Cindy Laporta (Paul Manafort’s Accountant)
- James Brennan (Federal Savings Bank Mortgage Banker)
- Dennis Raico (Federal Savings Bank Mortgage Banker)

A. This investigation is ran by Democrats!
- President is Republican
- House is Republican majority
- Senate is Republican majority
- Rod Rosenstein is Republican appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican
- Robert Mueller is Republican appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican 

B. This doesn’t have anything to do with Russia!
- The investigation is still ongoing (We’re only 1.5 years into the Trump presidency. Watergate took 2 years.)
- Paul Manafort has another trial a separate trial in September. I wonder what that could be for?
- Michael Cohen said explicitly he has evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government. Treason is a crime and a crime treated by capital punishment aka the death penalty.
- TRUMP'S Campaign manager, TRUMP'S National Security Advisor, TRUMP'S Member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Panel, TRUMP'S Political Consultant, and TRUMP'S Personal Attorney/RNC Deputy Finance Chair were all indicted. The TRUMP Organization CFO got an immunity deal. The National Enquirer CEO, TRUMP'S good friend, also got an immunity deal. AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP? Everyone in he has surrounded himself has either flipped, found guilty by trial, found guilty by a federal judge, plead guilty, recused themselves from the Russia Investigation, or has been granted immunity.
- Why are you so quick to dismiss someone of possible crimes?

C. Cohen's Guilty Plea from the Justice Department states (Says he has evidence to prove):
https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-eight-counts-including-criminal-tax

- “The plea was entered followed the filing of an eight-count criminal information, which alleged that COHEN concealed more than $4 million in personal income from the IRS, made false statements to a federally-insured financial institution in connection with a $500,000 home equity loan, and, in 2016, caused $280,000 in payments to be made to SILENCE TWO WOMEN who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, thereby intending to influence the 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.""

- “The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, Title 52, United States Code, Section 30101, et seq., (the “Election Act”), regulates the influence of money on politics.  At all relevant times, the Election Act set certain limitations and prohibitions, among them: (a) individual contributions to any PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, including expenditures coordinated with a candidate or his political committee, were limited to $2,700 per election, and PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES and their committees were prohibited from accepting contributions from individuals in excess of this limit; and (b) Corporations were prohibited from making contributions directly to presidential candidates, including expenditures coordinated with candidates or their committees, and candidates were prohibited from accepting corporate contributions.""

- “COHEN caused and made the payments described herein in order to INFLUENCE the 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  In so doing, he coordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments.  As a result of the payments solicited and made by COHEN, neither Woman-1 nor Woman-2 spoke to the press prior to the ELECTION.”


D. George Papadopoulos on Jeff Sessions and Russia:
- “While some in the room rebuffed George's offer, MR. TRUMP NODDED WITH APRROVAL and deferred to Mr. Sessions who appeared to like the idea and stated that the campaign should look into it” - Defense Attorneys for George Papadopoulos (Former Foreign Policy Adviser, who plead guilty in trying to set up a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin)


E. George Papadopoulos on Russia Trump-Putin Meeting:
- “I actively sought to leverage my contacts with the professor to host this meeting. The CAMPAIGN WAS FULLY AWARE OF WHAT I WAS DOING, including Corey Lewandowski (Former Trump Campaign Manager) and Sam Clovis (Trump Campaign Aide/Former  Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics For United States Department of Agriculture).”

Here are the options:
Option #1: Everyone in Trump's inner circle, opponents of Trump, and anyone that speaks negatively of Trump is a liar, according to Trump? 
Option #2: Trump is a liar and a criminal﻿.





Things TRUMP’S White House hires have said about their boss, TRUMP:
- “A fucking moron” - Rex Tillerson (Former Secretary of State)

- “An idiot. ""It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown. I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had” - John Kelly (Chief of Staff)

- “An idiot and a dope” - H.R. McMaster (Former National Security Advisor)

- “An idiot surrounded by clowns” - Gary Cohn (Former Chief Economic Advisor)

- “He’s like an 11 year old child” - Steve Bannon (Former Chief Strategist)

- “An empty vessel when it comes to things like the constitution and rule of law” - Scott Pruitt (Former Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency)

- “His mental decline could not be denied” - Omarosa Manigault-Newman (Political Aide)

- “Fucking liar” - John Dowd (Former Personal Lawyer)

The antidote to a government controlled by a powerful few, a government that divides is a government by the organized, energized, inclusive many.""

**""You cannot sit back and wait for a savior,"" Obama continued. ""You can’t opt out because you don’t feel sufficiently inspired by this or that particular candidate. We don’t need a messiah. All we need are decent, honest, hard-working people who are accountable and who have America’s best interests at heart.""""**"

Obama wasn't on many people's radars until he gave the keynote at the 2004 DNC convention. 2020 is a long way away, but I don't think they fully understand why they lost the 2016 election and are vulnerable to the same errors in 2020."

2488,9eh6xn,Because the republican congress cut the funding you moron. 
2489,9eh6xn,"For your first point. It's because it's illegal to do so. You also must remember that the efforts Russians took to influence the election were very microtargeted in strategic states that would hand Trump the election. It's very relevant that he lost the popular vote and was not elected democratically by the strictest sense of the word. 

Secondly, whatabouttism doesn't help anybody, we're trying to move on from the sins of our past by voting for candidates who don't take ethics for granted, and truly represent the will of the people"
2490,9eh6xn,"Because it's a federal crime?  Because it invalidates the results of the election?  Because it's almost surely going to rope in some GOP congressman and show why Trump is still in office despite committing impeachable offenses on a near-daily basis?

And it's not different than election/leadership meddling we have done, and those countries could have and should have arrested the people we put in power in many cases (assuming they had laws against it, and you know, that we hadn't corrupted everyone).

I'd say it's been demonstrated that he himself has no political philosophy and is just a egotistical asshole leading this country into a much less capable position than it was before he took office. We have become isolated and distant from our trade partners and allies.

2503,9eh6xn,"It doesn't matter because the popular vote doesn't decide the election. Democrats have won elections under the same electoral college system, so the argument that it unfairly biases one way or another is bunk.

Why did Donald Fucking Trump win the electoral college, the same system that Hillary Clinton was trying to win under? The answer to this question is what the DNC must seriously study and understand."

2511,9eh6xn,"It can! It just depends on how you vote, who you vote for, what policies they are supporting and what else you are doing to support said campaign. Voting is minimum. Then you have lawnsigns, letters to the editor, donations, parade walking, event hosting, phone banking, and doorknocking. Not to mention volunteering to be part of the campaign group (depending on the campaign). Things like secretary and treasurer are good starting points. 

If you really want to change who is elected, those are the things we need to do. 

I work on a political state house campaign and finding people who are willing to do stuff is like pulling teeth sometimes. "
2512,9eh6xn,">I don't think they fully understand why they lost the 2016 election and are vulnerable to the same errors in 2020.

And this is the problem, really. I was hoping with a Trump win, it would at least open the eyes of everyone and see how important voting is, picking the right nominee. Listening to what your voters want. Not just pushing your own agenda and trying to buy elections.

But who knows what 2020 will be. "
2513,9eh6xn,"Obama wasn’t even on the primary ballot in Michigan that year. It was an early primary, but I think I because of DNC rules, only Hilary was on the ballot. We voted for McCain to keep Mitt Romney off. This was pre-Palin. Biggest. Mistake . Ever!! (Palin)"

Hillary lost. We admit it. Time to move on. My god stop attacking the party. We are sick of it.  We got a congress to win back. Don't have time for your whinny  bullshit.
2531,9eh6xn,"Yes and no. Yes you’re right that in the short term we can only play the hand we’re given.

No, because longer term electoral reform is needed. The electoral system is biased because it systematically overweights rural and lower density states over urban and higher density states. It isn’t about fixing a republican vs democratic bias. It’s about fixing an urban vs rural one."

2545,9eh6xn,"You know we are getting really sick of you attacking our party with you bullshit accusations. As long as you continue to attack the party instead of join it, you will achieve nothing. Stop calling us names and attacking us. I mean fuck you and your ""corporate and establishment"" name calling bullshit. You have no idea of the steps that need to occur. Instead you attack us and stomp your feet and think that will achieve something.

Time to get out the vote for all democrats nominated. Not just the few that progressive who got nominated. They can all win and it won't mean squat if the dems don't take the house and/or the senate in November.

The primaries are over so join the party. We are sick of listening to your bullshit. All you do is bitch and repeat GOP rhetoric. We support whatever candidates won their primary be it a progressive or a ""corporate"" democrat. You should too.  If not, you should go start your own party and stop attacking ours."

2547,9eh6xn,"Wasn't about politcs? You talked about differing political philosophies, the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton. That's politics."
2548,9eh6xn,As may be. However a quick analysis shows a lot of Trump supporters have grown disillusioned to say the least with the shit show that Trump has released since his election. My comment was directed at the blind maniacs that still scream their support in all defiance of Trumps obvious incompetence. Americas credibility has been damaged severely on the world stage since he took office. Not to mention the loss of long time allies and trading partners with his ridiculous shenanigans. America will be decades recovering from the last two years.
2549,9eh6xn,"There is overwhelming evidence the DNC conspired to get Hillary over Bernie.  Your either ignorant or lying. The DNC has a lot of trust to win back and it won’t happen on its own.  They are walking on fucking egg shells, the world is watching and the future is at stake."
2550,9eh6xn,Maybe the party should cater to the voters instead of pushing candidates that have no redeemable qualities besides not being Trump. Trump being vilified by his own party only made him more attractive to red hats. Maybe the Democratic Party can learn something from that and get people who voters actually want on their platform. 
2551,9eh6xn,Oh I’m sorry I dislike political elites using a party system specifically designed to keep grass roots politicians out of the system to keep a grass roots politician out of the system. 
2552,9eh6xn,"someone's forgetting all the blatant shenanigans that went on
 
like at the Nevada primary for example
 
https://youtu.be/6swm3l19knc"
2553,9eh6xn,I always try to encourage people to vote third party.  The system in the US needs to change.
2554,9eh6xn,You can say the same thing about Gary Johnson though we know the answer. It isn't hypothetical.
2555,9eh6xn,Who tf are you lol?
2556,9eh6xn,"I've never voted for the same party in any elections. Voted Liberal Democrats, Green Party and Conservative most recently. I don't care about you personally, u don't know you. All I can do is merit you on what you write, that's the internet. But please make more assumptions about me that are completely wrong."
2557,9eh6xn,"I'm British and therefore my opinion on Trump is inconsequential. Your opinions on your politicians  hold greater weight due to living it. I don't wish to tell people that their way is correct or not, my reason for posting is due to the attitude people have, especially in politics, where it's OK to treat the other side like they're less than human in some way. It allows people to become closed off to what everyone around you is saying. That's all."
2558,9eh6xn,"Actually Trump supporters still support him. His approval rating from people that voted for him hasn't changed. His approval rating overall is right about where Obama's was at the same time.

2559,9eh6xn,"You know we are getting really sick of you attacking our party with your bullshit accusations. As long as you continue to attack the party instead of join it, you will achieve nothing. Stop calling us names and attacking us. I mean fuck you and your ""corporate and establishment"" name calling bullshit. You have no idea of the steps that need to occur. Instead you attack us and stomp your feet and think that will achieve something.

Time to get out the vote for all democrats nominated. Not just the few that progressive who got nominated. They can all win and it won't mean squat if the dems don't take the house and/or the senate in November.

The primaries are over so join the party. We are sick of listening to your bullshit. All you do is bitch and repeat GOP rhetoric from two years ago. We support whatever candidates won their primary be it a progressive or a ""corporate"" democrat. You should too. If not, you should go start your own party and stop attacking ours."
2560,9eh6xn,Maybe you can let it go already and stop attacking the party. Join it or get the fuck out. Candidates have been chosen. Vote for them instead of whining about two years ago. **The only thing that matters is getting back one of the house of congress.** Because if we don't we are completely fucked and it won't matter who you elect.
2561,9eh6xn,"Oh god..., let it the fuck go. Two fucking years ago. We got a damn congress to win back right now. Candidates are picked.

2563,9eh6xn,"Voting third party is a waste of a vote, and even if they did get enough votes the system would still be the same just with different parties, and seeing as the democrat party is the closest to a centrist party of the main parties (including the big third ones,) it makes more sense for independents to just vote Democrat this election (and in 2020 to get Trump out.)"
2564,9eh6xn,"I am a democrats that hasn't missed an election in 40 years. I support my party. I don't attack it. And I don't piss, whine and moan for something that happened two years ago.

2566,9eh6xn,"“Join it or get the fuck out”

I really hate to say it but you are full of shit and entirely out of touch if you think that is going to fly.

If that’s the official stance of the party I will walk the fuck away and I won’t be the only one.  

There are no 2 ways about it... the DNC has work to do.  Saying get on board or get out of the way is the exact kind of dismissiveness that got ya into the place we’re in in the first place.

Wake up."
2567,9eh6xn,"see the thing is that by letting it go, we allow the same people who got us into the mess to stay in charge
 
[never forgive, never forget](https://youtu.be/uSplRhHAI48)
 
Progressives only from now on
 
If they don't support Medicare for All (not ""affordable"" insurance plans), tuition-free college, cutting the $700+Billion military budget and ending the Wars, breaking up the banks, and a Green Energy Plan, or if they expect us to wait decades and take baby steps every single step of the way they have another thing coming"
2568,9eh6xn,"It's not a waste of a vote.  It's a vote to make a difference, not to keep things the same.  If you think it makes sense for independents to vote Democrat, you're sorely mistaken."
2569,9eh6xn,"We've never talked before dude? So why are you talking to me like we have before? 

You're a ""democrats"" ? "
2570,9eh6xn,Please walk away. Go do to the republican party what you are doing to the dems now. We can't lose if you do. We've listened to whine for two years now. We are done. Please leave. Please go be a republican.
2571,9eh6xn,"You wake up. We have an election in 60 days. The candidates have been chosen. If we don't win back the house or Senate, we are fucked. The courts will be stacked for over a decade. It won't matter who wins.

You sit and bitch about two years ago as the congress is up for grabs. Understand how it works. Just screaming and stomping your feet gets you nothing. "
2572,9eh6xn,"We have an election in 60 days. The candidates have been chosen.  Now is not the time to rehash the primaries. Support your party Stop attacking it. If we don't win back the house or Senate, we are fucked. The courts will be stacked for over a decade. It won't matter who wins.

Understand how it works. Just screaming and stomping your feet gets you nothing."
2573,9eh6xn,"How so? Most independents I know are well informed enough to vote Democrat, even though they don’t prescribe to the entire party platform. And your idea of making a difference will inevitably look like a third party outcompeting one of the major parties and a two party system with a new player "
2574,9eh6xn,"mmmm, that's how you get voters on your side
 
keep doing that"
2575,9eh6xn,Good luck in life. 
2576,9eh6xn,"We don't want you on our side if all you are going to do is bitch and attack the party. Go be a republican and do to them what you are doing to us. Please..., I beg you!"

2582,ac8fg7,"Remember, these people already think white men are the real minority. They probably are proud of the diversity represented in this picture."
2583,ac8fg7,Yeah but house GOP has Big Boss.
2584,ac8fg7,Snaaaaaake
2585,ac8fg7,America vs. Confederacy.
2586,ac8fg7,"I know this might be unpopular with you Americans... but isn't real diversity in what you think and do, not in what your skin color / gender is? We're pretty much all white where I live, does that mean my parliament isn't diverse? I am pretty sure a black man can be a good enough politician to represent white women or any other combination."
2587,ac8fg7,"Meh, if they do their job, that's what matters."
2588,ac8fg7,I'll show this picture to my kids one day. It makes me so happy!

2600,ac8fg7,One party represents the people. The other party represents monied special interests.
2601,ac8fg7,GOP: we have an eyepatch guy!
2602,ac8fg7,Democrats actually look like they represent the United States of America.
2603,ac8fg7,Voting for someone because of their race or assuming they're more diverse because of the color of their skin is racist by definition 
2604,ac8fg7,It's like looking at the Rebel alliance vs. the Empire.

2628,ac8fg7,GOP has a baby though. 
2629,ac8fg7,that's what really matters 
2630,ac8fg7,At least their ties are different colours
2631,ac8fg7,There’s kids and a guy with an eye patch I’m halfway convinced this is from a movie staring robin williams

2634,ac8fg7,"Let's make sure that diversity actually grows a spine and stands up to Trump and his idiotic wall.  

For once in my life, I'd like the Dems to dig in their goddamn heels and not bend over backwards to the GOP.  

**NO DEAL ON THE WALL.**

Period.  I don't give a fuck what minor concessions Trump is willing to walk back on.  I don't give a fuck if the government has to stay shut till spring.  We are not wasting $5 Billion on top of the $1.5 Billion Trump was already given in the last budget.  

But I fully expect that, once again, the spineless Democrats are going to bow down to Trump and the Republicans and make concessions after concessions."
2635,ac8fg7,"Well...not for nothing but the GOP seems to have a baby, an Amish child and Gerard Butler wearing an eye patch. "
2636,ac8fg7,"Here’s a funny concept: white people deserve representation too. And we deserve cultures, customs, and nations.

2645,ac8fg7,But the gop has a pirate!

2738,ac8fg7,Aaaand he goes on r/TD
2739,ac8fg7,"Hey now, they don’t mean actual intellectual diversity, they just mean non-liberal ideas!

Come to think about it, he probably doesn’t even expect the GOP members to be intellectually diverse amongst themselves, he’s just copy-pasting some arguments about liberals “not allowing” conservative ideas."
2740,ac8fg7,"I always flip this around.

Yeah, I agree that's important. So why are the Republicans refusing to elect anyone that isn't a rich white man? Focusing so much on race and gender must really hurt intellectual diversity, right?"
2741,ac8fg7,Racists gonna racist. 
2742,ac8fg7,I dont wanna shit on your parade because you draw a good point but should you really link someone's profile in you response? Idk maybe it's just me but it seems kinda sketchy.
2743,ac8fg7,"You're arguing against yourself.  Intellectual diversity (whether it be from experience or otherwise) should be the goal.  The idea to acheive this by meauring the amount of melanin in someones skin is laughable...

I've never seen a study or anything that isn't some bullshit PR press release that says the most attainable way to achieve intellectual diversity is through racial diversity.

Meritocracy.  That should be the end goal. Whether it means 100% white or 100% black.  Anything else is fundamentally racist."
2744,ac8fg7,"Im a Republican and I guess I could take up his argument. Racial diversity is not a great proxy for diversity of opinion due to the fact that race or ethnicity is a fairly arbitrary distinction. I don’t think someone’s skin color should dictate whether someone is “diverse” or not. An example would be if you took a sampling of a people from an upper class suburb of varied racial and ethnic backgrounds and asked them about their life experiences it would be more similar than if you repeated the study for people of the same race but of different socio-economic status. 

The fact is that a diverse group of representatives is no better than a group of “non-diverse” representatives. What makes a representative effective is successfully fighting for the interests of individuals in their district. "
2745,ac8fg7,"> Funny you should say that, because top business schools highly recommend diverse backgrounds among team members because the diversity of experience leads to higher-performing teams.  And people from diverse backgrounds also typically go to a wider range of educational institutions (not just the Ivy's), which also leads to intellectual diversity.

2757,ac8fg7,Which explains why the second picture is South of the first one.
2758,ac8fg7,"if everyone was voting people in simply on their ability to perform the job and completely ignoring race/gender. Then statistically we would see a breakdown of congress members that somewhat matches that actually population. 50/50 men and women, 61% white.

The fact that Republicans overwhelmingly elect white males means that they are prioritizing race and gender. The fact that the Democrats are closer to matching the actual population means they are prioritizing ability.

Edit: Just found some stats. 37% of Democratic congressmen are people of color, only 5% of Republicans are. For women, 38% of the Democrats, 9% of the Republicans."
2759,ac8fg7,"> We're pretty much all white where I live, does that mean my parliament isn't diverse?

If the public is mostly white, then it’s reasonable that most of representatives would be white. But that’s not the case here. We’re a diverse country and the legislature should look that way. Otherwise they aren’t representing the people. America has a long history of taking away the rights of minorities. Would you feel comfortable if you were black and not one representative was black? Certainly not. Representation matters."
2760,ac8fg7,"> but isn't real diversity in what you think and do

If you only have white males in your legislature, you're only going to have issues addressed that affect white males.

By having both racial and gender diversity, you increase the chances of addressing issues of concerns to all citizens, not just those of a specific gender and race.

>We're pretty much all white where I live

If you have an all-white country, then you'll have an all-white legislature, just like an all-Asian or all-Black nation will have legislatures of a single race. However, America is not an all-white country -- roughly 60 percent of Americans are white and non-Hispanic, and that percentage is shrinking."

2770,ac8fg7,"“If we don’t get what we want, one way or the other, whether it’s through you, through military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government,” Trump said. “And I am proud. I’ll tell you what. I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck. Because the people of this country don’t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it.  The last time you shut it down, it didn’t work. I will take the mantle of shutting down. I’m going to shut it down for border security.”"
2771,ac8fg7,"Trump shut down the government, he turned down a bipartisan deal and said he was happy to own the shutdown. There is no desperation from the Democrats, they hold all the cards and Trump has backed himself into a corner. Funny how a master negotiator turns down every deal offered him and leaves himself with $0 on offer. Maybe he isn't as good at the art of the deal as he claims.

Democrats aren't parading their diversity, they simply have it, whereas the GOP is mostly white and male and seems to discourage anyone who isn't from joining them. If the GOP would support policies that helped everyone they would quickly look as diverse as the democrats, but as long as they support racist, divisive policies they will just keep looking more and more uniform."

2777,ac8fg7,"Yeah, but the GOP's share of voters is ultimately an outcome of their policies and rhetoric.

Also, your logic doesn't hold up for Republican women. Women tend to vote more for Democrats, but not by much. [538 has some coverage that explains the difference](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-republican-party-isnt-electing-more-women/). A major factor there is that Republicans aren't doing the leg work to get women interested. Any attempt to right past wrongs is rejected as identity politics. Also, gender roles are still a major factor."

In contrast, about 38 percent of the Democratic caucus will be white men, which is actually higher than their representation in the general population (about 30 percent of all Americans are white males). Women in total will make up about 38 percent of the Democratic House caucus, and about half of that group are white while the other half are women of color.

America’s population or “Diversity” as you call it shouldn’t be reflected in gender or colour but in character. Isn’t that what Martin L King was trying to teach you? That a man or woman should be judged by the content of their character and not by the colour of their skin?

Seems like you are pushing further away from the sentiments of Mr King and going back to focusing on the colour of skin for diversity. If this is what you need to fulfil your goal where do you stop? What representation would be enough? Do you need 60% white of which 50% will be female and within that 50% brown hair and within that 70% brown eyes and so on? 

The point I’m trying to make is if your idea of diversity comes down to appearance you will never be done with trying to fulfil your diversity quota. If diversity comes down to thought or “character” well then you are done. Your legislators should represent an equal amount of ideas and were voted on by the population. "

2912,ac8fg7,What the hell does teachers have anything to do with this? This is about elected officials. Anybody can become a teacher if they get the degree. You have to be actually elected to become a member of Congress. This shows what your average voter prioritises by looking at the pic. 
2913,ac8fg7,"Uhh teachers are gender prioritized to be women due to the societal shift of pedophilia becoming a mainstream issue with direct focus on teachers and men. There is a cultural reason for the teacher issue, not so much for the representation issue, which is what elected officials are meant to do, represent a populace."

2915,ac8fg7,"> America’s population or “Diversity” as you call it shouldn’t be reflected in gender or colour

Curious how someone lecturing me, an American, on what it means to be an American is using non-American spelling.

>Isn’t that what Martin L King was trying to teach you?

What I see is someone who clearly does not understand the writings and teaching of Dr. King. I find it deeply offensive that you would try to claim that he would be more satisfied with a nearly all-white, nearly all-male group of legislators as being somehow more diverse than a group of legislators that was *actually diverse*.

Notwithstanding that crowd of nearly all-white, all-male individuals has a long history that's hostile to women and persons of color, so when it comes to character, theirs is pretty piss-poor.

>The point I’m trying to make is if your idea of diversity comes down to appearance 

I am a mixed-race woman. You seem to think that ""appearance"" is what separates gender and race and that superficial things common to white people like hair or eye color is the same as being of a different or mixed race. And then you're assigning that idea to me and debating that -- it's called a straw man argument.

I don't recall any history of red-haired or blue-eyed people being codified in this country as lacking rights or legal standing. I do, however, know a long history of people of different races being subjected to discriminatory legislation. That is why equating eye color with race is patently ludicrous.

"
2916,ac8fg7,"there is no ""diversity quota."" it's about making a level playing field for all participants involved. its been overwhelmingly clear that white men have dominated the political, social, and economic playing field for the better part of america's history. dr king is correct in saying that people should be judged by the content of their character and not by the colour of their skin but it's clear that the white skin color has been prioritized in americas history. you cannot argue against that. as such the need to bring in other races is necessary.

""diversity"" means including all equally. the fact is is that the playing field is not equal at all, as seen in the picture, and the most we can do is elect as diverse of a population as possible in order to start evening the field. "
2917,ac8fg7,"DO YOU LIKE BEER?!?

*tears in eyes*"
2918,ac8fg7,"Sorry dude, I don't buy it. None of what you made makes any sense in the context. 

In this context, Democrats are SHOWING they have diversity. 

In this context, you're wrong. "
2919,ac8fg7,"Ok so there is really a lot in this. 

So I believe it is a minority of people that that truly think diversity is good for the sake of diversity. They believe it has no merit other than to ensure that the face of a race or culture is on an oil painting somewhere.  Personal I believe most people don't really do much for ""Fighting for diversity"". Anidoticly I work in an environment that normally requires a large staff. The majority of the time the leadership at the top (Dir - SrVPs) are white males. Yet they end up with a rather diverse workforce. Most of the companies do in fact have diversity guidelines, however, they tend to be simply put ""don't NOT hire someone cause of race, creed, sex........). The point is that while yes, there are people that go out and cause problems if the ratio of minorities to the majority isn't 90/10. They are rare... and personally, I call these people extremist.  That being said, there is the same group on the other end of the spectrum.   


Yes, some with good intentions, lose their way... what is it, Harvard, that just got sued cause they wouldn't let someone in cause they have too many of their race already? Yes, it complicated, but I doubt it was this whole... we want and have to let people in cause we have a quota.  Its more the idea of not discriminating got out of hand.   


Now the kicker is you may hear about how the other side is full of these Extremist all the time. ""Ohh the Dems want to open the border and let EVERYONE in!"" , ""Ohh the GOP is just going to raise your taxes and cut all social services!"", "" So get out and vote and make sure the Dem/GOP doesn't take this right from you!""  I'm sure you've heard it time in time again. Yet every few years a single party controls the House, the Senate and the Presidency and none of these things have ever come anywhere close to happening.  Additionally, if you sit down and talk to the average person I'm sure they would agree they don't want those measures. Most people, on both sides, want smart immigration control, smart gun control, and a sensible tax plan. Even if the politicians tell you otherwise.   


The point is, we react to this fear that the other side is some nut job. Yet really they are our next door neighbors or the guy we talk sports with at the office. They just point that go on their way and just have a slightly different view of how things could be.   


I don't know if I really explained my self well enough, it's getting late here. But I hope you can follow it. 

And, yes, I'm a democrat... and really every democrat that I know... tends to feel the same. We really don't want open borders or to completely take away your guns. We simply want a path to citizenship that works and sensible gun control that keeps the nut jobs from getting their hands on them. "

I think diversity isn't desirable because it lowers social trust, cohesion, and participation. It leads to unnecessary and uncomfortable policy contortions that aren't based in reason. It permanently damages long term cultural continuity which in turn shortens the lifetime of a society. 

It's a pretty simple idea (people who share the same traditions, values, and beliefs typically get along better than those who don't), however, there's a large body of peer reviewed publications on this topic. If you're interested in learning more [this is a facile primer](http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/)

Wheeler: nope 

Spicer:  dang. Well, how's things otherwise?  You see that sports game the other day?

Ok now *maybe* Spicer called Butowsky up the next day and said he should lie about it, but Butowsky could have just decided that on his own too, right?"
3062,6qwrmn,"Bernie bro here!

While you idiots are busy being idiots, I'm making a choice between who I trust more.. ""rawstory.com"" or Seymour Hersh"
3063,6qwrmn,"Dude: he didn't even let Spicey meet the POPE. Spice y'all GOTTA have a grudge. Sick a really empathetic fed on him, he's gotta give em somethin."
3064,6qwrmn,You guys ready to let Bernie be your leader yet?
3065,6qwrmn,"This coordinated push to claim the Seth Rich story is bogus seems very much like the DNC attempting to 'get in front' of a major scandal that's about to break.

At this point, it's all but certain that authorities have found concrete evidence of conspiracy and murder."
3066,6qwrmn,"Oh no!  Out of the thousands of negative Trump reports, they were trying to push back! OH NO!!!! THE MEDIA ALMOST TIPPED A TOUCH RIGHT!! OH MY GAWD!!!!!!!!  IT IS THE END!!!"
3067,6qwrmn,Yawn. This isn't a story. 
3068,6qwrmn,We know who the leaker was now.
3069,6qwrmn,I'm so proud of little Spicey. He has the biggest freaking whistle in history and it is just warming up. 
3070,6qwrmn,"Don't worry, WIKILEAKS just released conclusive proof that Seth Rich was the leaker, your russia narrative is over. The forces of good shall prevail with lord Trump!"
3071,6qwrmn,"You wanna know the difference between Republicans and Democrats? Spicer can talk all he wants and won't 'commit suicide' when he's about to say anything damning. Spicer won't shoot himself in the back of the head or end up getting shot on his front porch like a democrat would. He won't accidentally die in a freak weight-lifting accident either. 
"
3072,6qwrmn,Fake news
3073,6qwrmn,"I don't know why OP didn't just link the NPR report. They're the ones who actually put in the work on investigating the story behind the Seth Rich conspiracy theories, and their article is way more thorough and accurate. But I guess it just didn't have the catchy, sensationalized headline...

3074,6qwrmn,"> I'm gonna go update my filters to not include rawstory.com anymore.

Smart. It's almost as bad as brietbart. "
3075,6qwrmn,"Why do you say the headline is inaccurate? It says ""White House coordination"" not ""Trump coordination"", and Sean Spicer at the time was the **White House Communications Director**."
3076,6qwrmn,"Thank you, was just coming here to comment something similar. I was sitting here like ""am I reading the same thing as OP?""

Something fishy is going on when a lot of the news stations start making pretty bold hit pieces off of not much evidence I've seen so far. We've seen how this plays out before.."
3077,6qwrmn,Fake news about fake news from the administration that claims everything is fake news. It's hooting monkeys flinging shit at each other while the rest of us quietly give up on the whole thing.
3078,6qwrmn,"You know good? Well rawstory Is the other thing.

Too bad really, I would eat up a surprise spicey spice hero story. I can't help but want to like the guy despite his entire existence and all of his actions."
3079,6qwrmn,Um... that only means he can't confirm that Trump himself was involved. Sounds like he's pretty much confirming that there was coordination with with White House staff though.

3095,6qwrmn,[deleted]
3096,6qwrmn,Usually news organizations give people a heads up if the story is about them. Like your Nixon example. But this story wasn't about Trump at all.     
3097,6qwrmn,"Just the delicious irony that the administration which started yelling ""Fake news!"" was caught actively faking the news, along with the whole affair putting Fox in a terrible light.  State TV, indeed!"
3098,6qwrmn,"Yeah the article doesn't really substantiate the headline. ""Press Secretary Briefed on Press""...shocking."
3099,6qwrmn,"For me, it's more about the hypocrisy of the right blowing up about any journalist coordinating with Hillary."
3100,6qwrmn,"He had an in-person meeting about the story, not a call for comment or anything like that. And he proceeded to lie that he was unaware of the story when reporters asked him about it after it came out. "
3101,6qwrmn,[deleted]
3102,6qwrmn,I am sure that a few pro-democrat networks would have to go down were this standard applied across the board. Politically neutral sources are kind of rare these days (if that's even something that could be achieved).

3108,6qwrmn,"That would be an editorial pushed by Israel and blamed on the Russians.  
It also does not mean they are incorrect.  
  
Twitter deleted, or hid, the u/panda4bernie account which was was Seth Rich's.  
We saw the content on it for a day or two before the story blew-up and Twitter got rid of it.  
u/pandas4bernie was created in 2017, this account combined with deleting the real account, was presumably to sow confusion and lead people to your conclusion.  
  
This is also where and why Kim Dot Com enters the picture.  
Maybe KDC is just grabbing headlines, but if we admittedly swallow a big pill here and give him the benefit of the doubt ... he acted as an intermediary between the leaker and Wikileaks. The leaker had a panda-related account name and sent the material to KDC. Once Seth's love for pandas become well known KDC figured out who it was that sent him the material.  
  
I feel it is also important to mention that there were multiple ""leaks"". The material sent to Wikileaks which the DNC and Hillary and Podesta have confirmed is their email and then the Guccifer 2.0 documents which are forgeries and were published publicly on Word Press, not Wikileaks.  
Podesta clicked on a phishing scheme that linked to a Russia-hosted website; this was after he forwarded a suspicious email to IT asking if it was legitimate and IT replied and told him it was legitimate ... but that was a typo and the guy meant was **not** legitimate. His emails ultimately ended up on Wikileaks as well. Again I would point to Israel as the most-likely source of government espionage in making this happen.  
  
It's a bit beyond me why Hillary and Podesta would admit their emails are authenticate given the activities described therein.  
They could have just denied they were real. The only thing that would add-up is-if a large number of people in Congress et. al. and all being blackmailed and coerced and this was a way to start to leak the information. I do believe DWS in particular is being coerced. All of the real evidence points to DNC IT as a heavily compromised organization and if that is that case they could have dirt on a great many DNC staff and personalities.  
  
Rumors are Imran Awan was arrested by the FBI.  
A beacon of hope if it is true but I haven't been able to confirm beyond the abundant sources of compromised ""news""."

3119,6qwrmn,"We've known for a long time that Fake News Fox News has been and continues to be a propaganda conduit for the Republican Party, RNC and Putin/Kremlin, but this seals the connection. Not only was this Fox News Fake News story about Seth Rich meant to derail the ongoing Trump-Russiagate investigations but it was also meant to deflect attention away from all the reports of Sexual Predator activity at Fox News headquarters: Ailes fired, Shine fired, O'Reilly fired, etc. Ergo, a bunch of Sexual Predators at Fox News have been colluding with the Trump administration which has been colluding with Putin/Russians against America, against Democrats, against Hillary Clinton, with these corrupt, traitorous Republicans trying to hide their treason. Thankfully, Sean Spicer has blown the lid off this right-wing conspiracy against America."
3120,6qwrmn,"Talk about children.  You seems to not even understand what a primary even is.  The DNC can't meddle in,their own,primary because they are already in 100% full control of the process.   Hell  both parties don't even have to allow people to vote in their primaries."

3157,6qwrmn,"Fair enough, but there's still no scandal here(yet) or law breaking.  At least an argument could(if it wasn't Fox) be made that it was a story that had to do with the election, and that the WH would inevitably be asked about it.  I just can't get hyped up about this, because not ever single movement anyone there makes is evidence or something worse.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, as they say.  IMO, the important story is the NPR one about Trump & Co. [maybe helping write the story.] 
 (http://www.npr.org/2017/08/01/540783715/lawsuit-alleges-fox-news-and-trump-supporter-created-fake-news-story)  Spicer's days were numbered long before he left, and I doubt that he was involved with that."

"
3160,6qwrmn,"The debate questions were given to Hillary.  
That's an entirely different level of corruption.  
  
Also, while the right was losing their minds over the collusion between Obama and MSM they went ahead and passed legislation making propaganda legal and Obama signed it into law. This is the kind of shit that ought to turn you into a libertarian because now Trump gets to abuse this power. That's how it works.  
  
Don't give the President a power that you don't want the other side to wield."
3161,6qwrmn,">  And he proceeded to lie that he was unaware of the story when reporters asked him about it after it came out.

Yes, he was given a heads up.  Like I say in my original statement, it's not uncommon for journalists to give politicians a head up when a big story is coming that their team may have to respond to.  As for the lying - There's no law that says they have to answer every single little question, or do so truthfully.  Seriously.  This isn't a courtroom.  You don't have to like it, but it's true and it's useful sometimes. What capital crime is it to deny knowledge of something if a reporter asks you? If it was one, the Lewinsky affair scandal would have ended a bit differently.  It's much ado about nothing.  The kind of meaningless shit the GOP would howl about.  We're better than that."

Checkmate"
3178,6qwrmn,"Well, we'll see.  Maybe it'll get investigated properly."
3179,6qwrmn,"For one, the NPR article itself does not claim the quotes were fabricated. It  reports that *Wheeler alleges in his lawsuit* that the quotes were fabricated. That is an important distinction.

Second, I tried to find a video of Wheeler saying one or both of those quotes, but I wasn't able to find one. Could you please provide a link to the video(s) in which he states those quotes?"
3180,6qwrmn,Link to video(s)?
3181,6qwrmn,Your reading comprehension is horrible... Npr never claims anything. It clearly says Wheeler is making the claims. 
3182,6qwrmn,"I don't think you understood the article. ""Fabricated"" in this context means the statement was manufactured by Fox for Wheeler to repeat on air. This is not NPR editorializing, it is what Wheeler is claiming in his suit.

No one is claiming he didn't say those things. That wouldn't even make logical sense. If his interview never aired, he wouldn't have filed his lawsuit in the first place."

Someone already pointed out that this was obviously not a routine heads-up, since this article had nothing to do with the White House, and the meeting wasn't even with the journalist in question anyway. 

Basically this event raises the same question we've been asking for the last year: why do Trump's people keep meeting with people they're not supposed to, and then lying about those meetings? The obvious interpretation is that they're doing shit they're not supposed to. "

Trump Jr. took a meeting with what he was told was a lawyer representing the Russian government as part of the Russian government's efforts to aid his father's campaign, in order to receive dirt on his opponent. 

Jr admitted to this meeting happening, even though he lied like 4 times about who was there and what was discussed. This alone is bad enough. "

3216,6qwrmn,That is how each party picked who would run under the name of the party for most of us history. It was not until 73 or 74 that voting became part of it.

3217,6qwrmn,">  How is the process in which a parties front runner is chosen to represent them in the presidential election, NOT crucial to the process? So you're essentially telling me it's completely okay to have no choice in who represents one of only TWO parties to pick from in an election?

No, things that happened during their election had nothing at all to do with them.../s

> Basically this event raises the same question we've been asking for the last year: why do Trump's people keep meeting with people they're not supposed to, and then lying about those meetings?

Because they're fucking corrupt. It's not that complex. Nixon did it with the Vietnamese, Reagan did it with the Iranians.  Shit, if you tell me Dubya did it with the Saudis, I'd believe it.  It's a republican trait for almost 50 years running now.  Still, newspapers will give administrations(either party) a heads up sometimes.  It keeps their relationships running smoothly.  As for the lying about this meeting in particular - Because they aren't beholden to you.  What business is it of yours or anyone's if someone in the WH gets a heads up from a journalist?  Foreign nation, I get, but do you seriously believe there aren't Obama/Clinton/Carter/LBJ meetings that went unannounced?  Journalists literally have a term for it, that Moochie just learned - ""off the record"".  ""Off the record"" just means you'll deny(lie) about it, be you the Jurno or the Politician.

a. He lied about it.

The Killian documents controversy (also referred to as Memogate or Rathergate) involved six purported documents critical of U.S. President George W.

Four of these documents were presented as authentic in a 60 Minutes II broadcast aired by CBS on September 8, 2004, less than two months before the 2004 Presidential Election, but it was later found that CBS had failed to authenticate the documents. Subsequently, several typewriter and typography experts concluded the documents were forgeries. No forensic document examiners or typography experts have authenticated the documents, and this may not be technically possible without the original documents.

Fact one.

* Foreign Agents Registration Act Financier and former Russia investor William Browder testified at a hearing on the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). This law requires those representing the political interests of foreign powers to disclose their relationship. Mr. Browder told committee members that the Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. was heading Russian efforts to get sanctions under the Magnitsky Act repealed. The act blocked Russian government officials and businessmen associated with the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky from entering the U.S., froze assets in U.S. banks, and banned the use of American banking systems.

Fact two.

*  Donald Trump Jr. releases 'entire email chain' regarding Russian meeting

Fact three.

*  Trump dictated misleading statement on son's meeting with Russian.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump dictated a statement, later shown to be misleading, in which his son Donald Trump Jr. said a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 was not related to his father's presidential campaign, the Washington Post reported on Monday.

They (Trump and his administration) admitted this today.

The undisputed facts about the June 9 meeting point to clear intent to coordinate with the Russian government’s covert intelligence operation to influence the election. The apparent eagerness on the part of the most senior members of the Trump campaign to meet with Kremlin-linked figures; the willingness to acquire and use material provided by the Russians; the failure to report the meeting to U.S. law enforcement; the subsequent repeated public denials that any meetings with Russians had occurred; the misleading statements made about the meetings in the face of evidence that they had occurred; and the denial of any Russian election interference demonstrated that the Trump campaign was a willing and capable partner with Moscow in its covert influence operations targeting the election.

3351,9jgzdi,"Looks like he's just saying ""waaahhhh!"""
3352,9jgzdi,"Every single woman in this photo has a look of disgust. 

I love it."
3353,9jgzdi,What’s up with the guy on the left in the back?
3354,9jgzdi,"His reaction to the accusations are very telling. EVEN IF an investigation proved the allegations could not be proven/were false, his lack of professionalism, and respect for his colleagues and the law during questioning are enough to say he does not deserve a seat on Supreme Court. How did it come down to this?!?! Jfc"
3355,9jgzdi,"Clarence Thomas was cool as a cucumber. Brett Kavanaugh, not so much."
3356,9jgzdi,Historic because he’s being voted in?

3358,9jgzdi,“A man defending himself from wrongful allegations and shameless slander acts by the Democratic Party” I predict it will go down in history and this will be the quote attached.
3359,9jgzdi,Does anyone know what’s going on in this photo? The context could very well be that they’re disgusted by the idea that the Clintons and the democrats blah blah blah or whatever. 
3360,9jgzdi,THIS IS A MISLEADING PHOTO. ALL THESE WOMEN ARE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF KAVANAUGH 
3361,9jgzdi,As someone who doesnt follow politics I find it weird that they have some dude sit in a court or whatever with cameras and basically just grill him about his life. And the whole time everyone is **super** serious. I dont know. It is just weird.
3362,9jgzdi,Can someone tell me what happened?

3366,9jgzdi,"This is a temperament for the Supreme Court?  Also scary that he’s obviously in the hip pocket of Trump, Graham and the republicans, in general.  This certainly will lead to his  manipulation by them all, so there will be no objective, nonpartisan voting on the court, by Kavenaugh."
3367,9jgzdi,Only if he gets the job. 
3368,9jgzdi,what a circus. 
3369,9jgzdi,"Unfit for the Supreme Court. Plain and simple. I don’t know if he’s a scumbag, but he’s demonstrated today he’s not fit for that level of responsibility. "
3370,9jgzdi,The looks of sheer disgust and horror on the faces of the women seated behind him says it all. 
3371,9jgzdi,We live in a fucking dystopian cartoon
3372,9jgzdi,"Everyone's face tells me all I need to know. Also, is baldy with the glasses on the left okay? He sleeping? Dead? Can anyone check on him?"
3373,9jgzdi,Time to dust off the old *snowflake* accusation
3374,9jgzdi,"This is not going to work like the Democratic Party wants. This man’s name is ruined. He will not be charged. What you should be more worried about is the next candidate.

3406,9jgzdi,"How his title begins with ""Honorable"". Yeah, no. "

3421,9jgzdi,"When he gave his emotional opening statement, my mind opened a little. Not in a way that I thought Dr. Ford was lying or not telling the truth but...I don't...just enough to listen. This outburst was the cap of his escalating disrespect of the democratic senators asking him questions. I thought, ""He's being rude, forceful, and mean in public when not drinking, it's no longer a stretch for me that he could be a mean drunk."""
3422,9jgzdi,Seriously. That moment was surreal. He wants to be a Supreme Court Justice and his response is “you are!” To a Senator? Wtf?
3423,9jgzdi,"That response was ridiculous. So many times I was yelling ""answer the damn question"""
3424,9jgzdi,Look at his wife’s face. That says all you need to know

3430,9jgzdi,Underrated comment of the day
3431,9jgzdi,Boom! This is the comment I came here to see! 
3432,9jgzdi,"Yes, it has been mentioned several times throughout this thread that that is his wife and other relatives. They were brought there as his support, but they sure don't look like they're supporting him, do they? Even his own family is disgusted by his behavior. "
3433,9jgzdi,"He's angry because he's guilty. Lashing out because he's been caught. Dude obviously doesn't come close to having the temperament to be a judge, much less a SC judge. "
3434,9jgzdi,"Seriously. Could you imagine him behind closed doors deliberating a case with the other SCOTUS judges? The current judges have given lots of interviews praising their collective ability to have open minded deliberations about cases - I can't imagine how Brett would fit in there. 

We must save RGB from having to interact with Brett every day! "
3435,9jgzdi,'I wonder how many ceiling fans could be installed... lots of shit would hit them today'
3436,9jgzdi,It’s Danny DeVito saying throw Kavanaugh from the train.
3437,9jgzdi,Looks like he’s trying to slink away unseen.

3442,9jgzdi,Including his wife
3443,9jgzdi,"Iirc that facial expression, the asymmetrical lip twinge, is usually the calling sign of ‘contempt’"
3444,9jgzdi,"Judging by quite a few comments here, it seems like a lot of people didn't actually watch the hearing. Kavanaugh's opening statement was incredibly emotional, and there were quite a few moments where he was choking back tears and struggling to maintain his composure.

To make this clear: **I'm not here to make a judgment about what might have happened between Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford.**

I just think it's not exactly a ""good look"" to say that the people in this picture are disgusted. That's a blatant misrepresentation of the truth. The people to Kavanaugh's right are his family, as far as I know, and they were seen to be struggling just as much as Kavanaugh was during the more emotional moments of his opening remarks. 

tl;dr: Don't misrepresent the truth. It's incredibly easy to do, especially in settings where there are cameras snapping off dozens of photos every second. It reminds me of that photo from not too long ago where Trump was surrounded by other world leaders, and they were looking at him with rather serious/chastising looks on their faces. Another photo from a few moments later showed them smiling and laughing. A few seconds is all it takes to provide a photo which can be used by either side to forward their agenda, whereas the truth is likely somewhere in between those two extremes. I guess this wasn't much of a tl;dr, but yeah. Just wanted to toss in my $0.02."

3462,9jgzdi,"Honestly, the most surprising thing to me about this entire ordeal was how many times he literally just said “I like beer”.   I’m no highly distinguished, Yale educated lawyer currently in line for a Supreme Court nomination.. but if I was facing a senate judiciary committee that was trying to determine whether or not I used to engage  in a persistently inappropriate and sexually predatory lifestyle fueled by alcohol.. I’d probably limit the amount of times I said “I like beer.”    "

3536,9jgzdi,"The beginning speech and sobbing had me going.  Turned it off for a while after that, but came back an hour or so later and wasn't even sure if it was the same hearing anymore. It was like night and day."
3537,9jgzdi,That was the intention. He knew what getting emotional like that would do. 
3538,9jgzdi,"I said in my original comment that his statement made me really think. I started to wonder how two people could both tell their truths and the stories be inconsistent. I believe what she said this morning, and I started to find him credible when he was reading his statement. The range of emotions were completely understandable: the anger at first, the frustration then the sadness and upset at times. I felt for him. He then started to show this level of disdain and disrepesct for the democrats asking him questions and that's where he lost me. He is trying to become a supreme court justice and I guess I just expected a certain level of decorum. 

As part of my job, I sometimes have to work with individuals who have difficult personality disorders. I will bend over backwards to assist them, and they will run to my Director to complain. I didn't do anything wrong, it's just the way some of their brains are wired that making someone else's day a little worse makes theirs a little better. So, after they bash me to that Director, I have to meet with that same person who complained about me and said nasty things. I can't let on that the personal jabs bothered me, or he/she will complan that they feel uncomfortable complaining. I see these individuals for years having to deal with this cycle. Sometimes, for your job, you have to breathe and remember to be respectful. That is my opinion. We can have differing ones. That's what makes this world so awesome :)"
3539,9jgzdi,Unsubstantiated because there is to be no FBI investigation.
3540,9jgzdi,You should think again.
3541,9jgzdi,"By refute you mean the other accused attacker is denying it, someone who wasn't in the room said they didn't see it, and someone says they don't remember that specific party? 

Editing to remove sarcasm: In the hearing these are the specifics I recalled. I just looked again and can't find those specific wordings. All articles just said they don't remember a party like that, or a party with him. Apologies. "
3542,9jgzdi,"I'd be fucking respectful because that's what the situation calls for. He's not arguing with a friend, he's at a Senate hearing!"
3543,9jgzdi,Assuming that I didn’t do anything wrong? I wouldn’t shout and scream at the judge and jury. I wouldn’t throw a very public temper tantrum especially if my moral character is on the line. 
3544,9jgzdi,Confidently. Not defensively.
3545,9jgzdi,She's probably been at least yelled at.
3546,9jgzdi,"> It's like he didn't know the point of the blackout line of questioning

You're kidding, right?  He was avoiding exactly BECAUSE he understood the point of that line of questioning."
3547,9jgzdi,Regardless I think it's obvious both Kavanaugh and Klobachar have both undoubtedly gotten their black out drunks on.
3548,9jgzdi,"That was no false accusation.

And if there were a false allegation, he'd be the first one to demand a full investigation tout suite.  He wouldn't rest until he got one.  He's doing the very opposite of that.  "

3571,9jgzdi,Oof
3572,9jgzdi,"you know, he's actually stupid enough to be a GOP presidential candidate, now that you mention it."
3573,9jgzdi,"yeah, and really, he doesn't even need to do that.  the repubs are going to do everything for him.  and from then on, all he has to do is take orders."
3574,9jgzdi,Kavanaugh ruled that polygraphs could be used for job screening.  
3575,9jgzdi,"republicans love pseudoscience though.  this is how we communicate on their level.

Brett doing everything he can to avoid one says a lot, imo.  

thought about something else.  Brett also complained about evidence while praising trump, the original birther. "
3576,9jgzdi,The Clintons are brewing pizza! And I’m on the menu /s 
3577,9jgzdi,Do not lie. He absolutely did not. I watched the entire thing. He steadfastly refused to call for an FBI investigation every time he was asked. 
3578,9jgzdi,"no he didn't.  He was asked many times and all he kept doing was

>uh...uh...uh....I'll do.....uh....uh..what every the......uh....uh..committee recommends.  

While being all uncomfortable and antsy, looking around for help.

This whole thing was trying to get him and/or republicans to do an investigation so we help learn the truth.  They want no part of the truth.  "
3579,9jgzdi,No he didn’t. He refused to every chance he got. I Listened to the entire hearing.

Oh God, I shouldn't laugh, but that's just too funny. Wanna know the last time I was so upset I cried? When I was in elementary school! 

I know, I know. These are serious allegations and anyone would be upset. But Dr. Ford has more reason to be emotional than this joke of a judge."
3596,9jgzdi,Absolutely not.
3597,9jgzdi,"I think most people who sit in that position will never have to endure this kind of attention again. So no, I don't think his inability to handle the most intense grilling of a lifetime makes him unqualified to do the job. I think a long list of his other qualities make him unqualified for the job."
3598,9jgzdi,"And so did Ford. The people behind him are clearly disgusted at what their seeing. That's not scared, that's shocked and appalled."
3599,9jgzdi,Sexual assaulters are way bigger fucking losers and so are you for enabling them 
3600,9jgzdi,You came into the Democrats subreddit to defend an abuser. Seems to me like you’re the loser.

wifey actually does look like she's pondering whether he did it or not.  "
3607,9jgzdi,He’s that stupid?
3608,9jgzdi,"Pseudoscience differs from actual science in that the method, mechanism, or process of something considered pseudoscience is often inconsistent or unreliable, which means that results can be gamed or otherwise inaccurate. I would personally rather not leave the blocking of the nomination of a potential sex criminal to the SCOTUS up to something that can be easily gamed or misinterpreted. Besides, a negative result for them would have Republicans disavowing the polygraph as pseudoscience just as quickly as they embrace it when it suits them. 

Criminology is an actual science, let’s have an investigation instead. "

Just wanted to say that it's ok to cry, kid or grown up, man or woman."
3621,9jgzdi,Yeah. Initially i was sympathetic but his conspiracy accusations and combative nature really threw that out the window. He's sober and this upset. I can easily believe a lil alcohol and he loses control. 
3622,9jgzdi,Crying is fine if you are regretful of your actions and wanting to change. He was not regretful.
3623,9jgzdi,Your toxic masculinity is disgusting. 
3624,9jgzdi,"That is a valid point of view, I have to agree with you that his other qualities should disqualify him but imo this grilling showed that he can crack under pressure, who’s to say he won’t crack under pressure from a political bias while on the Supreme Court. Could be nothing and I could be reading into things, but I know what we had seen yesterday was the real, true Kavanaugh "
3625,9jgzdi,"That is, when I wasn't busting my ass to get into Yale. I got into Yale without any connections.  It's number 1!  I got into Yale!"
3626,9jgzdi,oh yeah.  this guy couldn't author a distinguished opinion if his life depended on it.  He's a hack.
3627,9jgzdi,"That is a massive mischaracterization both of the statement made above and of what happened. First the statement was that he called for an fbi investigation. He didn’t. The person was right in saying that he didn’t. Secondly the fbi did not investigate these accusations and the background checks did not cover the issues being discussed now. 

And no they are not arguing about everything his is a statement of fact. The fact is there was no investigation and they have refused to start one and he refused to answer the question. "
3628,9jgzdi,"I just told you what he said after you lied about what he said and then you quoted me.  He and republicans are doing everything they can to prevent an investigation - they are not hiding this fact.

He has not been vetted over these allegations.  another lie.

He can't be trusted because he is being accused of rape by a very credible victim while diminshing all his credibility by doing everything he can to avoid an investigation.

You can't even recall what was said today and you think you're going to talk about clinton.  This just is another reason kavanaugh is insane - he blamed the deep state and the clintons while also believeing ford.

try again, trumper."
3629,9jgzdi,She knows what's coming as soon as they get home. 
3630,9jgzdi,You're absolutely right. I cry. Everyone should have a good cry every once in awhile or when something bad happens. Just not this SoB.
3631,9jgzdi,Is this your party?
3632,9jgzdi,"That's the most terrifying part of this. He is supposed to be a judge. Level headed, calm and calculated. At least that's how I see a judge. "
3633,9jgzdi,And I understand that. But like you said hes not regretful. He's upset because he essentially got caught.
3634,9jgzdi,"My toxic masculinity? I bawled my eyes out when my mother killed herself because she couldn't live In constant physical pain. I cried when my son was born because it was a beautiful and painful experience and I couldn't bear to see my wife in so much pain. I cried when I found out my son has a speech impediment because hell struggle to be understood, even by us, his parents. I get emotional whenever I hear the national anthem because I live this county and am hurt by the turmoil that the Republican party has thrown us into over the past several decades. I got emotional when I heard Dr. Fords testimony,  both the pain she went through and is currently going through.

Not to mention I expect a Supreme Court Justice hopeful to be far more poised and in control of themselves even under intense scrutiny. Dr. Ford had more composure than Kavanaugh!

Take you're toxic masculinity and fuck off."
3635,9jgzdi,A fairly apolitical position at that. They arent supposed to attack congress. Democrats or republicans. 
3636,9jgzdi,"Oh don’t worry, he was only upset because it was about HIS life, if he was jusdging other people and their future he wouldn’t give a shit and certainly wouldn’t be emotional enough to cry or put any thought or feeling into it except how it would affect him. "
3637,9jgzdi,"> At least that's how I see a judge. 

Ever seen one in real life?"

3646,7ik4sm,"Now I'm generally fairly right leaning on most subjects but I totally support all forms of welfare. For one it's shocking to see people call us a christian nation (which isn't true in the first place) and then condemn the poor and anyone different from them. More importantly though as we enter in to a new age of automation and increased efficiency there's just simply less options for people. I don't want to become like India or China where the poor are left naked, starving, and homeless in the streets. What do people really think would happen right now if millions of Americans stopped receiving welfare? There would be rioting and looting the likes of which haven't been seen since the slaves were freed."

3665,7ik4sm,"It’s a lot easier to be lazy and cry for handouts then be one of those 400 at the top. Yes there is a imbalance look up Ray Daila I think is his name. He started bridgwater hedge funds, he is one of the smartest investors ever. He explains the state of our economy very well. He breaks it down and says there are really 2 economies, the bottom 60% and the top 40%. The bottom 60 is having a very hard time getting by and the top 40 are making more money then they have ever made. This is why the economic reports show our economy as thriving and in a great position but that’s only true for the top 40%. Now his answer to this is for the under educated and lower class to have principles and morality and make decisions based on there principles not there emotions. Also our education system is a wreck, AI is going to be taking over a lot of jobs here soon and kids need to be learning how to write code and other skills that will prepare them for a good job in the future, just because AI is coming does not mean there are not going to be jobs it just means we have to change our skills and mindset from working against AI to working on and with AI. If you look up Tony Robbins podcast he has one on there also very good info on economics and what needs to change to help that bottom 60%. Also please realize there is always going to be a top 1%, the only difference is in socialism and communism there government employees. Castro family is by far the richest family in Cuba, daughter of Hugo Chavez’s is the richest person in Venezuela. I don’t think it’s bs that these big corps exist, they do provide jobs and services, what the problem is when they mix with politics and the politics makes rules to benefit the corporations over the people. Uber is great example, great idea and great service but taxi companies in some of these big cities who pay the politician campaign funds don’t want know parts of it. Or watch the movie Tucker a man and his dream, good movie but infuriating. Govt+big businesse 👎"

3693,7ik4sm,Good thing no one believes that.

3695,7ik4sm,There’s is no such thing as gun control only monopolization of ownership. 
3696,7ik4sm,Is that how many people are on welfare or something? Can we do something bout 3rd generation wellfare families?
3697,7ik4sm,"Not a Democrat, and I know that may get me banned. Liberal, leftist and extremist subreddits tend to ban when people state dissenting opinions.

Number 1, no one thinks 150 million people are being lazy. That's just silly. Even people who say, ""Everyone on welfare are lazy"" will qualify that statement when pressed.

Number 2, whether you like how the 400 made their money, or whether you think they don't deserve it or not... them wanting to keep it, is not them being greedy. Everyone wants to keep control over what they have. That's from the poorest to the richest.

What's greedy are the people who think that they deserve other people's wealth or they feel that they get to judge what is 'fair' or not.
"
3698,7ik4sm,It’s easy to be lazy makes sense 
3699,7ik4sm,"Technically speaking, everyone is lazy and greedy at the same time "
3700,7ik4sm,"It’s not your money, you fucking idiot"
3701,7ik4sm,"Because they're doing nothing. The 400 are doing everything and fighting as hard as they can, while everyone else isn't."
3702,7ik4sm,*get the them to hate each other. 
3703,7ik4sm,"It goes a bit further than that.

The underlying theme is that everybody is greedy. But for that greed to lead to riches you need to work hard. The 150 million are just as greedy, they are just too lazy to reach the same goals as the 400.

That is a cynicaly worded version of the American dream, but it basically is what many believe to be true. He who works hard is successful is ingrained to such a degree that it's easy to believe that those who are poor are poor because of lazyness. This is even believed by people who are poor despite working hard."
3704,7ik4sm,They also influence people who are meant to represent us. 
3705,7ik4sm,They wouldn’t lie to us. And what would you like Santa to bring you for Christmas. 
3706,7ik4sm,And here I was thinking it's because they want to believe the lie...because we can't handle the truth...that we let our country go over so little. 
3707,7ik4sm,Amen
3708,7ik4sm,"**Just-world hypothesis**

The just-world hypothesis is the assumption that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic justice, destiny, divine providence, desert, stability, or order.

The hypothesis popularly appears in the English language in various figures of speech that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: ""you got what was coming to you"", ""what goes around comes around"", ""chickens come home to roost"", and ""you reap what you sow"".

Trickle down economics was the gov't's way of allowing for the rich to invest in the poor, but we've seen with the Panama papers and other leaks that they don't invest, they hoard. Majority of investments only occur when there is demand, demand is created by consumers, not the other way around. I do agree, be mad at the Politicians, but why? They're not listening....but why? The rich have bought them and drowned out the voices of the poor. Now, tell me again, who is being immoral?"

It's fucking called compassion for fuck sake. Nobody needs 5 yachts and 10 mansions all over the world. People *need* food. This issue becomes even *more* clear when you consider the fact that the wealth of the 1% is often bolstered by doing everything they can to avoid taxes. They extract money from the populace who provide the labour and create the market and then turn around and avoid paying back in to sustaining the system that *made them.*"
3725,7ik4sm,"There’s not regulations that stop them from investing. Investing is what they do, in fact. They give to charity, in part to offset taxes (or donate to their church). Recently, there was a chat some of them had to see if the lowered taxes would go to jobs or investment. The rich admitted they won’t be making more jobs. Investment alone does not necessarily create jobs. What’s more is that a lack of regulation and taxation on the wealthy at the cost of the lower classes has LITERALLY precipitated every major economic downturn in the past couple centuries. It doesn’t work. 


What’s more is, and I’m from the area that I am speaking about, when we look at constantly poor areas, like Appalachia, investment doesn’t come into those areas from the wealthy. They pull their businesses out, despite tax incentives from cities and the states. Industries leave, creating a class of jobless citizens trapped in a place with fewer jobs than people who need them. The despair, paired with lingering injuries from the nature of their old jobs, leads to depression and medication abuse, which created the Opioid crisis as we know it in the Appalachian region. It’s expensive to invest in these impoverished areas; the rich don’t want to do it because of the cost. 

We could remove every regulation on the book and that wouldn’t change BECAUSE it’s expensive. There isn’t a line of wealthy people waiting at the gates for these institutionally poor areas. The best way to raise up the poor is to give them the means for them to do it themselves in the best possible way. How is that done? Through institutions like head start, educational grants, and improving public education through increasing their budget, as well as offering affordable healthcare and the like, we could see massive growth in economic mobility. Instead, we feed the rich what scraps we can from our tables when they have a feast in front of them and then try to scramble and catch what crumbs fall to the floor and THAT would make things better? I’d rather not."

That 90+% of corporate profits now go to stock buybacks rather than investing in their work force or in their communities? Do you really think your salary reflects how much you actually contribute to a company? I can tell you that mine doesn't, even though I know I get paid fairly well. Productivity has steadily increased with the economy since the 80s, yet the average worker salary has been flat, meaning all of those gains have gone to investors and higher upper management salaries.

The term appears to have originated in the early 19th-century United States (particularly in the phrase ""pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps"") to mean an absurdly impossible action, an adynaton.

The analogy is to a dog whistle, whose high-frequency whistle is heard by dogs but inaudible to humans.

The term can be distinguished from ""code words"" used in some specialist professions, in that dog-whistling is specific to the political realm.

They're view is literally one cul-de-sac to the next.  They are just smart enough to be ahead based on their parents white privilege and success but just ignorant enough to not know why they became racist and classist.   Fox and Breitbart prime viewership. They then vote down tax increases for education and to help others in need because why give away money. That's why so many suburban schools are now broke or needing vouchers to subsidize the revenue because their base voted down education. And because they never needed help in the suburbs financially, they literally can't fathom anything other than the safety of their lives so everyone else is just lazy.

By your logic yes, UBI increases your incentive to work, in that you can now earn your welfare and your wage, but you neglect the reality that everything would just simply be inflated in price to account for this. 

The UBI is supposed to be the capitalist answer to automation. In the scenario that UBI would be implemented, they get their service from automation. Capitalism requires that the rich are parasitic on the working class, however the UBI is the solution to the parasitism no longer being necessary.

Welfare incentivizes the laziness that capitalism created. I'd work even if didn't have to. In fact, I literally work today in hopes of working for myself tomorrow. It is human nature to work freely. Capitalism estranges people from working freely so that they don't fulfill their human nature. Consequently people end up hating work because it is associated with subservience. 

The inflation from UBI would come from the demand curve shifting right. Consequently with more demand the firms would raise price to cash in. This also assumes massive centralization of the firms because the only way UBI would be implemented is a future capitalism whereby all of the industry is essentially in a few hands, probably monopolies. Consequently, the firms would by knowledge of consumers having extra money increase prices.

3829,7ik4sm,"Well, considering it only applied to people making over 2 million dollars in a year, they are already making literally enough money that they could work for one year and then retire for the rest of their life.

90% is likely too high, even for a top marginal rate that only applies on income earned beyond the first 2 million (when adjusting the previous level for inflation). But 50%, for instance, would likely be fine."

3844,6w589t,"Let's just look at some numbers for executive branch members under the past few administrations.

Obama (D) - 8 yrs in office. Zero criminal indictments, zero convictions and zero prison sentences. Amazing!

Bush, George W. (R) - 8 yrs in office. 16 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 9 prison sentences. Yikes.

Clinton (D) - 8 yrs in office. 2 criminal indictments. One conviction. One prison sentence. That's right nearly 8 yrs of investigations. Tens of millions spent and 30 yrs of claiming they were the most corrupt ever and there was exactly one person convicted of a crime. Clinton clearly lied under oath, was impeached, but not in the Senate and not removed from office.

Bush, George H. W. (R) - 4 yrs in office. One indictment. One conviction. One prison sentence. Pretty good for a Republican, one term wasn't enough time to do real damage. Remember this in a couple years, please.

Reagan (R) - 8 yrs in office. 26 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 8 prison sentences.

Carter (D) - 4 yrs in office. One indictment. Zero convictions and zero prison sentences.

Ford (R) - 4 yrs in office. One indictment and one conviction. One prison sentence.

Nixon (R) - 6 yrs in office. 76 criminal indictments. 55 convictions. 15 prison sentences. Impeachment initiated in the house but resigned.

Johnson (D) - 5 yrs in office. Zero indictments. Zero convictions. Zero prison sentences.

If you were keeping score, 

Democrats in 20 years...3 criminal indictments, 1 conviction, 1 prison sentence

Republicans in 28 years...120 criminal indictments, 89 convictions, 34 prison sentences.

So whenever I hear people whining about how corrupt the Democrats are compared to their holier-than-thou Republican party, it drives me a little more insane.

3878,6w589t,"**ATF gunwalking scandal**

""Gunwalking"", or ""letting guns walk"", was a tactic of the Arizona Field Office of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which ran a series of sting operations between 2006 and 2011 in the Tucson and Phoenix area where the ATF ""purposely allowed licensed firearms dealers to sell weapons to illegal straw buyers, hoping to track the guns to Mexican drug cartel leaders and arrest them"". These operations were done under the umbrella of Project Gunrunner, a project intended to stem the flow of firearms into Mexico by interdicting straw purchasers and gun traffickers within the United States. The Jacob Chambers Case began in October 2009 and eventually became known in February 2010 as ""Operation Fast and Furious"" after agents discovered Chambers and the other suspects under investigation belonged to a car club.

The stated goal of allowing these purchases was to continue to track the firearms as they were transferred to higher-level traffickers and key figures in Mexican cartels, with the expectation that this would lead to their arrests and the dismantling of the cartels.

Donald Trump is an American businessman, television personality, author, and President of the United States.

An analysis by USA Today published in June 2016 found that over the previous three decades, Trump and his businesses have been involved in 3,500 legal cases in U.S. federal courts and state court, an unprecedented number for a U.S. presidential candidate. Of the 3,500 suits, Trump or one of his companies were plaintiffs in 1,900; defendants in 1,450; and bankruptcy, third party, or other in 150. Trump was named in at least 169 suits in federal court.

4013,6w589t,"He's just pointing out they're not made up conspiracy theories, they're actual news stories  with facts and people and dates.  They may not have been Obama's *fault,* but as president, that's kind of his responsibility to be accountable."
4014,6w589t,"I'm no fan of Dubya, but I can really understand what happened to him there.  He gets the news and he's in a room full of children and he doesn't want to panic and he needs to think of something, and he probably has to wait for a team to get together.  I think he was just taking a breath before finally doing something.  He was probably prepared to take it easy with the largest economic stimulus in decades and big fat profits for military expenditures.  It was s'posed to be a softball.  He probably needed to adjust and get psyched up to perform as well as govern.  It's a tough fuckin' job, regardless of party affiliation, and while the whole aftermath is a goddamn mess, I would be lying if I said ole Dubya didn't love his country.  "
4015,6w589t,I still don't understand this. He was reading a picture book to a bunch of kids. There are 100's of people below him who can give orders. The 5 min he spent reading the book was time that everyone is saying wtf is happening and gathering intel. It's not like when the first tower was hit we knew it was terrorist and there'd be 3 more planes followed by the towers collapsing. He was remaining calm in front of a bunch of kids. He acted appropriately in that 5 min I would say.

It was a scandal on the arizona state level. "

You do realize that right?"
4024,6w589t,"Hard to pin a scandal on someone who didn't know about it.

The point of this post isn't that the government was perfect under Obama, just that he personally wasn't involved in anything even remotely scandalous, which is a bit of a change from our other modern presidents"
4025,6w589t,"He did that, too. He said it would cost American loves to bring Al Alwaki in. So would you have sacrificed people to bring one terrorist to trial? "
4026,6w589t,To not know? You mean people intentionally keeping it from him. You can't have it both ways.

4028,6w589t,"**ATF gunwalking scandal**

""Gunwalking"", or ""letting guns walk"", was a tactic of the Arizona Field Office of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which ran a series of sting operations between 2006 and 2011 in the Tucson and Phoenix area where the ATF ""purposely allowed licensed firearms dealers to sell weapons to illegal straw buyers, hoping to track the guns to Mexican drug cartel leaders and arrest them"". These operations were done under the umbrella of Project Gunrunner, a project intended to stem the flow of firearms into Mexico by interdicting straw purchasers and gun traffickers within the United States. The Jacob Chambers Case began in October 2009 and eventually became known in February 2010 as ""Operation Fast and Furious"" after agents discovered Chambers and the other suspects under investigation belonged to a car club.

The stated goal of allowing these purchases was to continue to track the firearms as they were transferred to higher-level traffickers and key figures in Mexican cartels, with the expectation that this would lead to their arrests and the dismantling of the cartels.

Also, I think u/lead_oxide2 was more interested in some of the sources you prefer to find your information from.  Even in aggregate.  Like, I love Raw Story and The Hill, but often need to check other papers to see how they feel on the same story.  Wall Street Journal and Washington Post are polar opposites, but if they both have the same take on something, I'm ore inclined to take the information shared in both as accurate.

4090,7zwjmf,"I wouldn't have a problem with Trump dodging the draft because the draft was fucking stupid and the war in Vietnam was bullshit, but he is such a prick about it and he says that he feels like he was in the military because he went to a military prep school, he disrespected John McCain's record as a war hero, he said he knew more about ISIS than the generals. He acts like he *did* serve in the military even though he didn't.

And as for that cop, I have just a little bit of sympathy for him. He should have gone in and tried to save those students at the risk of his own life, that's the job. At the same time, though, he didn't want to die. As a cop in a school I don't think you ever expect to have to get into a firefight with a guy armed with a semiautomatic rifle, and if you aren't prepared for that it's hard to say what you'll do when the time comes. If people want to call him a coward it's cool, I don't think that's inaccurate, but they should also call every cop who shoots an unarmed man a coward too instead of defending them and pretending every cop is a hero, because they're trying to do the same thing: save their own asses instead of doing the very dangerous job they signed up to do."
4091,7zwjmf,How did you expect him to run with his bone spurs? hahaha
4092,7zwjmf,"It’s sick how his party accused the victims of being crisis actors. This younger generation will come out and vote, the repercussions will be seen against the Republicans."
4093,7zwjmf,That deputy is still a coward.
4094,7zwjmf,"tbh this is one thing that I can say I agree with him on. You sign up to be a cop your job may occasionally require you to rick your life to protect and serve, Sooooooo FUCK that guy for sitting around while unarmed children died "
4095,7zwjmf,That’s not even a good point. The cop has already signed up for a dangerous job. Also Vietnam was an immoral war and anyone who missed it made a good decision. 
4096,7zwjmf,[deleted]
4097,7zwjmf,"This is retarded.  A fuck-ton of people fought very hard to avoid that draft because they didn't want to die in a war no one supported for a cause no one believed in. I'm sure Trump would have fought just as hard to avoid any other war, but still.  

On the other hand, you have a cop who is only really at the school to ensure general safety. We're expected to revere cops because they ""protect your lives with theirs."" He's not legally obligated to do a damn thing, but he absolutely had a moral obligation to do more than nothing."
4098,7zwjmf,"Uh...aren't we supposed to want police to, y'know, involve themselves in shooting situations?

This is like when Joe Lozito was forced to stop Maxim Gelman's killing spree because the cops just...wouldn't."
4099,7zwjmf,"Sound of an AR15?  No.  The sound of gunshots.  You don't need to weigh down your statement more with the notion of a weapon boogeyman, Lawrence.

Also, what-in-the-fuck does this partisan, straw man bickering have to do with anything?  Bill Clinton and Joe Biden received deferments too.  Are they also cowards in this context?

The cop in question was trained, equipped, and already took an oath to protect and serve.  He signed up for this willingly.  So, while it may be bad form and indecent to point fingers while using him as a scapegoat in our latest school massacre witch burning sideshow, this guy is still a coward for neglecting his duty."
4100,7zwjmf,"Why do we have to call Trump out on every single thing? I hate him as much as the next guy, but this is getting annoying. The cop is a coward, he deserves to be called one. A military draft shouldn't exist, I would've tried to get out of it too. 

Edit: I love how whenever the comment section doesn't agree with the point of view of the mods they just lock it, lol. "
4101,7zwjmf,"Poking fun at Trump for getting out of the draft implies you are okay with a military draft.

Can’t stand the current administration, but this argument makes me cringe whenever I see it."
4102,7zwjmf,"Those bitch ass sheriff's deserve fucking jail time. Negligence, dereliction of duty, etc. Aaaand fuck trumps bitch ass too. "
4103,7zwjmf,you guys are pathetic .he was a sworn officer with a weapon that could have killed any human on the planet. coward coward coward.
4104,7zwjmf,"Fighting to kill people in their own country for no benefit to America vs fighting to defend children from being slaughtered.

Not comparable at all."
4105,7zwjmf,"A soldier running from battle is a bit different than a student not wanting to sign up as a soldier. Does Mr O'Donelll say anything about Bill Clinton or his many peers and contemporaries who fled to Canada during Vietnam or otherwise ""copped out""?

(silence)"
4106,7zwjmf,"As much as I think Trump is a hypocrite. In this case he is both that and correct. In a situation where everyone of those gunshots was students, whom he was sworn to protect, being gunned down he chose to do basically nothing but wait for backup. In this situation he's supposed to be the one taking as much control of the situation as possible before backup arrives. Especially when others gave their lives to actually do something"
4107,7zwjmf,so the war in vietnam was justified and the right thing to do?
4108,7zwjmf,Clinton dodged the draft too.
4109,7zwjmf,They're both cowards
4110,7zwjmf,"""If you dont go off and fight in unjust and unnecessary wars, you can't be president ""

Of course war mongering democrats would think like that."
4111,7zwjmf,"This is wrong, It's essentially saying that if you conscientiously object to participating in the murder of the Vietnamese people because the Gov demands you kill them, you are a coward.

4112,7zwjmf,Let's be honest Vietnam was a bullshit war. 
4113,7zwjmf,"Wow, you really hit him hard with that one...

4114,7zwjmf,Maybe the officer had bonespurs?
4115,7zwjmf,How much time did Obama serve in the armed forces? Oh thats right he didn't because he was a community organizer. You know the PTO at school.
4116,7zwjmf,But they're both cowards. 
4117,7zwjmf,We need to poke at Trump's ego this weekend. I really want to see a tweet storm.

They're trying dox that dude, who let's be honest, is probably going to end up killing himself, right?

They are desperately stirring the pot trying to distract from Mueller investigation, playing both sides.

This is in indisputable confirmation that the President of the United States is getting his marching orders from the same source as the concern trolls that have flooded social media all week preaching extremist positions on gun control, both for and against.

4138,7zwjmf,"It feels like the GOP are going for broke.  I think they realize future generations won’t be able to be manipulated as easily because the vast reach of the internet provides knowledge to almost everyone.  They know that power is slipping out of their hands so they’re cashing in their chips, being horrible monsters, and then they’ll drop out of public life and politics for jobs in the private sector.  Leaving the bare bones of what the GOP used to be and a ton of lunatics without direction.  Some monster will either pick up the pieces or maybe the GOP can recreate itself as something for the people as opposed to corporations.  "

4140,7zwjmf,Next election will prob go dems then back to repubs and thus the great cycle continues. Can we get a 3rd party that isn't insane already?!
4141,7zwjmf,You mean “some people” because conspiracy theorists are all over the place politically but you only hear and see the ones who support your world view.
4142,7zwjmf,"Nobody truly knows how they will be in combat until it happens. 
Most people will surprise themselves and act in extreme situations. However, there are few who freeze and it isn’t until then that they realize that they are not cut out for it.
Be disappointed in the guy all you want. I’m sure he’s plenty disappointed in himself. 
Let’s stop attacking him though and focus on how to make sure nothing like this happens again. "
4143,7zwjmf,"Yeah, but it does prove the point that a good guy with a gun isn't the answer to a bad guy with a gun. "
4144,7zwjmf,But Trump isnt the one to tell him
4145,7zwjmf,Yeah what the hell is this? Police don't have to protect kids because Trump didn't go to Vietnam? Really? 
4146,7zwjmf,I love how he's the bad guy 1.B in all of this. Anything to distract from the weapon.
4147,7zwjmf,"Your first priority as a first responder is your own life. If you are injured or killed you not only will not be helping anyone, you are quite likely to make the situation worse. Yes, police are becoming more aggressive in response to active shooters, but that doesn't mean individual officers are supposed to be taking suicidal or reckless actions. The sheriff is just as much a piece of shit as Trump is. He's simply using the officer as a scapegoat for his own inadequate handling of the numerous tips and reports on the suspect. What makes it even more frustrating is how it's being used by people to prop up the narrative that guns aren't part of the issue, as you can see from the rest of the responses to this thread. "
4148,7zwjmf,"Yeah, considering cops constantly get away with literal murder because they ""put their lives on the line everyday"", this is inexcusable. The entire point of a cop at a school is for this kind of threat, not to harass schoolchildren."
4149,7zwjmf,"I'm sure you would've ran in there, your single fire gun blazing, so you could die. Right."
4150,7zwjmf,[deleted]
4151,7zwjmf,Don't condemn them for being a draft dodger; condemn them for being a draft dodger that calls the brave cowards.
4152,7zwjmf,"I think the criticism of the Vietnam era draft was that the wealthy and or well connected could obtain deferments while the poor, or working class could not.   So what Trump was able to pull off is what people find to be unjust about the draft.  
Draft dodging was a bigger political issue in the 80s and 90s than today.  Bill Clinton and then maybe to a lessor degree Bush 2 were both criticized for not serving.  
My father choose to just signup rather than get drafted.  He went into the Air Force which kept him out of combat (he wasn’t a pilot).   I guess he saw that as a way to avoid combat yet still serve.  "
4153,7zwjmf,"It is the hypocrisy that is being pointed out, not whether or not it was the right thing to do."
4154,7zwjmf,"He dodged the draft and told us that ""kneeling"" disrespected the sacrifice made by soldiers.
He dodged the draft and told us that that sheriff was a coward.
He dodged the draft, illegaly and told Illegals, who like Trump, feared for thier lives, that they had to be deported.
"
4155,7zwjmf,Because radical leftists can't advance their agenda on merit alone. 
4156,7zwjmf,"It's politics, they attack anyone on the other team for anything they can make a sound byte of. Even things they've done themselves, like in this case... Lawrence got a deferment. It's best not to listen to the words of anyone political, just watch their actions and eat popcorn."
4157,7zwjmf,That cop ran in terror while teenage boys gave their lives to protect students.  That cop should turn in his badge in shame. 
4158,7zwjmf,Did either of those men call others cowards for not running into an active shooting situation? Because you appear to be skipping over the part where Trump is being a hipocrite in favor of whataboutism. 
4159,7zwjmf,"Exactly, what kind of free country has a fucking draft for something like Vietnam? Do we call Mohammad Ali a coward? Some probably do, most celebrate him as a legend. "
4160,7zwjmf,"He dodged the draft and now pretends he is a military man. Wants tanks and a show of force for his parades. Wears uniforms he never earned.

Him skirting the draft isn't what makes him a loser, it's the rest of it. "
4161,7zwjmf,"Muhammad Ali dodging the draft for the reasons he did are honourable and make sense. He also was very open about avoiding the draft

Trumps only reason was fear. He still claims it's only because his bone spurs and that he wanted to go. He claims to love war and knows more about it than anyone else. He wants to start wars that would cost the lives of many soliders

So no mocking his draft dodging is not support of a draft. "
4162,7zwjmf,"It doesn't matter if you believe in the draft or not, Trump is being highly hypocritical."
4163,7zwjmf,"No, I'm not ok with a draft, but if you're going to dodge it, do it honorably by burning your draft card or getting imprisoned. Not like how Trump and how Nugent did it, in cowardice. And then prance around like you're some big time hero and American icon. Fucking pathetic."
4164,7zwjmf,"Psst, the other guy also had a similar weapon and you'd run like a bitch too. "
4165,7zwjmf,"The thing for me is Bill Clinton did it as an act of civil disobedience, he knew he might get punished by the law for it. Trump just got a nice medical deferment and didn't have to consider any consequences."
4166,7zwjmf,"we have no qualms with a student not wanting to sign up as a soldier, what we do have a problem with is when that same student calls other heroes cowards for not risking their own life when he certainly won't do the same."

4184,7zwjmf,"But I NEED cheeseburgers, Mr.Lahey!"
4185,7zwjmf,I would say its more because they are more self-involved. People aren't really that stupid. They just don't give a shit and think people should accommodate them.
4186,7zwjmf,"The term ""crisis actor"" in its modern context wasn't coined until the weeks after the Sandy Hook Massacre. "

4189,7zwjmf,"If anything, this last election proved how easily manipulated most people are, regardless of generation or media outlet.  Facebook was the main target of Russian meddling but Reddit wasn’t much better. "
4190,7zwjmf,"Really hammered home by people like Trump and SHS trying to pull the old “I never said that!” as if there aren’t cameras and microphones (and tweets) around every time they speak. It’s like they forget modern technology exists, and we DON’T have to just “take their word.” "
4191,7zwjmf,"Hillary was a sign that we've had enough.
I'm figuring at least half of the people who voted trump weren't pro-trump but anti-hillary."
4192,7zwjmf,how? the good guy with a gun still has to *do something* just magically having a gun doesn’t solve problems 
4193,7zwjmf,If anything this proves you can't rely on government to protect you. 
4194,7zwjmf,"It might have been if this deputy were not a coward.

What is the point of police in schools? Just to harrass the students?"
4195,7zwjmf,"He wasn't a good guy.  He was just not a bad guy.   He was at best morally neutral .  A good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun, the problem is that 99 times out of 100 he won't or will actively make things worse.  I only mention this because if we say one case disproves the theory they only have to find one to prove it. ..or at worst two."
4196,7zwjmf,"He was just outgunned. Now, if we give all the teachers grenades and claymore mines... that would make the school safe."
4197,7zwjmf,*semiautomatic gun. Pistols as well as the ar15 are semiautomatic. Calling it single fire makes it sound like a musket.
4198,7zwjmf,if I signed up to be a police officer yes I would because THATS THE FUCKING JOB. Just like when a nurse goes into a room and gets pucked and shat on by somebody with god knows what disease BECASUE THAT'S THE FUCKING JOB!!! if you don't want to deal with work hazards then don't TAKE UP A HAZARDOUS JOB. as the rappers say if you're scared go to church.  
4199,7zwjmf,Right back at you child. I mean seriously he was a police office armed and trained and paid to occasionally put his life on the line to protect citizens and when the time came he didn't do anything and over 10 kids died but yeah I'm nto thinking critically for expecting him to uphold the oath the took when he was given a gun and a badge by the local government to specifically protect the school from harm that he abandoned. I have several member of the police force and armed forces in my family and they went to and go to work every day wit the understanding that their duty doesn't end at the first sign of major inconvenience. Idiots like you are like mill stones tied around the democratic parties neck . I guess the only time we expect the police to actually use their weapons is when an unarmed black person is on the other side of it 
4200,7zwjmf,"But the officer was not brave. He didn't do his duty, he didn't even enter the school. "
4201,7zwjmf,"And insults PoWs and says those who died in service ""knew what they signed up for""."
4202,7zwjmf,Okay but the officer wasn't brave in this case.  He literally did not go in nor do anything to save those kids.
4203,7zwjmf,[deleted]
4204,7zwjmf,It's the same as how Ali didn't go. Ali didn't hide or make excuses. He said the Vietnamese never called him nigger now take me to jail. Trump made it look like he was unable to go and then criticizes people who did. That's fucked.
4205,7zwjmf,"So condemn them for being hypocrites?

4206,7zwjmf,Democrats aren't radical or leftist though.
4207,7zwjmf,"Where did you hear O'Donnell got a deferment? I call bullshit. You're not Russian, are you?
Edit: comments locked. He went to Harvard, he did not get a deferment. "
4208,7zwjmf,He did. I think I heard in the radio yesterday that he resigned. 
4209,7zwjmf,"Well yeah of course, this is Trump we’re talking about."
4210,7zwjmf,">do it honorably

*does not compute*"
4211,7zwjmf,I think that most people would have used any excuse that they could. I think that Trump is a fucking buffoon but politics doesn't need to be like team sports. 
4212,7zwjmf,Plus Bill Clinton isn't calling others cowards
4213,7zwjmf,I ave no idea whether Trump id or did not actually have a medical condition. Civil disobedience gets Clinton fof the hook? lol. How convenient. Clinton did not suffer any inconvenience either.
4214,7zwjmf,"Someone who chooses to be employed as a cop or security guard has been hired for that duty because they agree to that duty and the potential they may need to put themselves into the line of fire.

4215,7zwjmf,"Oh, what a surprise, someone comes along to deflect the uncomfortable reality of history. Sorry bud, I grew up during that time. and there are a whole lot of powerful people who side-stepped the conflict one way or another. Do  you have even the faintest clue how many people used the educational deferment to avoid the draft?"
4216,7zwjmf,It’s in the Conservative Handbook. 
4217,7zwjmf,Komrade? snort. You're deluded by your hate. I'm simply a 12th gen american and a 40-year registered member of the Independent party who calls a skunk a skunk when I see them.
4218,7zwjmf,"Well, at least I have a basic grasp of vocabulary, which you seem to be severely lacking.  The word you are looking for is hypocrite, not coward.  All 3 people, clinton, trump and the officer, avoided danger.  They are all cowards. "
4219,7zwjmf,The quote was calling Trump “the most cowardly president in history” for doing something a previous president(Clinton) also did. 
4220,7zwjmf,Yes that makes sense because of the twist.
4221,7zwjmf,"You know that for a fact? I doubt it. Clinton actively avoided the draft. Have a problem with that? Just because you read it on some blog or heard it on 
""main stream media"" doesn't make it true."
4222,7zwjmf,"I’m 23 and not a lot of people my age around it are voting because we are millenials, but it’s starting to change we are coming out in droves especially these last 3 years if you check the statistics. I’m excited tbh"
4223,7zwjmf,"This is basless agitprop to distract from the Mueller indictments. The trolls were attacking the security guard all day yesterday, the exact same why they dissected the Las Vegas shooting to distract from the original indictments last October.

This is proof that Trump is informed by these same people that have been all over social media this week pushing extreme, hysterical reactions to the Parkland shooting.  

This idiot can't stop telling on himself."
4224,7zwjmf,"Yeah. This is a bit of a troubled analogy. Volunteering to go kill people for a your government's political benefit and acting in defense of innocent children being killed in front of you are two substantially different things and would produce different behaviors in many people. 

I'm no advocate of gun violence to end gun violence, but I do think many non-contracted gun owners would have at least TRIED to help if they had been standing there and known what was going on. Frankly, I think many people would've done SOMETHING without a gun. There's no telling what Trump or any of us would have done in the same situation, but it's certainly a more immediate and morally absolute matter than throwing yourself into the middle of a politically motivated shitstorm overseas.

4230,7zwjmf,Yeah but I just can’t see that being an ongoing problem.  We have a massive security breach for this country with misinformation on social media.  Something will have to be done about it.  Once we get people running the country who DON’T want Russia to influence us.
4231,7zwjmf,"Which also speaks to the effectiveness of propaganda bullshit, given how many people loathed her for no good reason."
4232,7zwjmf,"Yeah. And police spend hundreds of hours training to deal with these situations, and their lizard brain can *still* overpower their conscious intentions. And we expect untrained teachers and civilians to be more effective? "
4233,7zwjmf,Or that adding more firearms to the situation doesn’t prevent or solve anything. 
4234,7zwjmf,Yep. Time to get rid of the military I guess.

And i know guys who would love to get into a shootout against an armed assailant. I wouldn't label these people as ""good guys"" even though i know they would shoot back and the media might call them ""heros""."
4238,7zwjmf,[deleted]
4239,7zwjmf,"Most police officers wait for backup before running into a hostile environment. Maybe you're not that smart. It's part of their training. I've never seen a one  man swat team.  Have you? So go ahead. Be a hero, and get killed. Easy from your arm chair, isn't it."
4240,7zwjmf,[deleted]
4241,7zwjmf,"To use that against him is beyond insane. He said that those soldiers were incredibly brave and despite knowing the sacrifice, they chose to sign up."
4242,7zwjmf,"In this case yeah Trump is right about the guy being a coward. But think back to ""John McCain isn't a war hero. I don't like people who were captured."""
4243,7zwjmf,"This isn't an isolated case, look at what he said about McCain. He has shown over and over and over that he is a coward and a bully."
4244,7zwjmf,[deleted]
4245,7zwjmf,And who has the right to call him a coward? 
4246,7zwjmf,"He wasn't. Trump has been shitting on actual brave men and women for a while now though, so taking shots at his cowardice is warranted."
4247,7zwjmf,Yes. I would say Trump's particular brand of hypocrisy is pretty exceptionally worthy though.
4248,7zwjmf,"He never said they were, he said ""Radical Lefists"" which there is an abundance of thanks to Communist/Marxist professors indoctrinating the youth."

4254,7zwjmf,He probably would have faced some repercussions had Vietnam draft dodgers not been pardoned.
4255,7zwjmf,"I'm not saying what he did wasn't cowardly. Volunteering for a duty is different then when it's time to actually nut up or shut up. Some people, untrained, without volunteering can be heroes. Others, seasoned and trained will freeze up. You literally can't know which you are until that day comes."
4256,7zwjmf,So that makes it okay? 
4257,7zwjmf,"Know what for a fact? 

Trump actively claims his bone spur story. 

And Obama didn't dodge the draft because he was 13 when the war ended."
4258,7zwjmf,"I know this for a fact, yes. Enough with the false equivalencies, please. Trump is an idiot who has sold his soul to the Russians and cares not one whit for any American other than his own family."

4264,7zwjmf,"I wish Aaron Feis, who used his body to shield students, would have had a gun.  I'd wager he would have overcome his lizard brain. "
4265,7zwjmf,Police definitely don’t train with their weapons nearly as often as many civilians do.
4266,7zwjmf,"Guy with gun protects himself and others from guy with gun looking to kill all of them. There, solves everything. "
4267,7zwjmf,"I blame him for not trying to help students getting fire upon, he's a coward, I don't care how you try and justify his actions (or lack of).."
4268,7zwjmf,"The fight-or-flight instinct exists for a reason. People act like they’re impervious to base survival instincts. But in those situations, it’s impossible to predict how an untested person, regardless of their level of training, will react. /r/iamverybadass, all of them. "
4269,7zwjmf,"I'm sorry but if children you swore to protect are dying in agony nearby and you can help, but do not, you have forfeited the possibility of being considered a good guy, particularly if you yourself applied for a job and accepted money, made your living  for years off the very idea that when needed you would protect them.   

You can choke or freeze up for a moment or two, but a minute or so in you are through the initial terror reaction and you're making active choices again. 

If we allow the umbrella concept of good guy to encompass such a one as this, it's value as a descriptor is gone. while highly subjective to start with, it still has to mean something. 

I keep seeing all these people saying no one knows what they would do but that just simply isn't so.   I know I would do something. I don't know what the outcome would be but I know I would try to affect the outcome.   Countless people know they would because they have decided before hand that that is the kind of person they want to be.  And this isn't bluster.  I have faced death to save people in the past and would again.  And I'm not bragging or saying these things to self agrandize,  I did those things because I have a responsibility to help my fellow man when I can, I will not always be able to but if I can and I don't I would not be able to live with myself.  I have expectations of the kind of person I will be and I hold myself to them.   Edit: auto correct errors

That’s its own separate issue though. Yes, Trump is an asshole, hypocrite, coward, etc. But this specific accusation against him is just an amalgamation of bad logic and ad hominem attacks."
4276,7zwjmf,"No. The guy isn't a coward, he just had common sense.

Going in alone he' have likely just gotten himself killed.
There's a reason why police usually wait for backup."
4277,7zwjmf,"Understood, I'll be less jackbooty."
4278,7zwjmf,"Pretty much everyone.  He knew what his job was and in the incredibly rare instance where he was to perform his highest duty he failed purposely.  It wasn't as if we plucked some random guy off the street, put a uniform and gun on him and said just walk around this school for twenty years and should there be an attack just do what feels right.

He applied for the job, trained for the job, and then failed to do it.   I don't wish him harm or need to know his name but the shame should haunt him."
4279,7zwjmf,"According to the First Amendment, everyone.

4306,7zwjmf,"> who has the right to call Trump a coward for ducking the draft?

That’s the point: calling him a coward for that specific thing has ground only if in your moral system people who are forcefully drafted are obliged to go and die if ordered to.

There’s plenty of other things that can be used as examples to demonstrate why exactly Trump is a coward. Using weak arguments like this just muddies the waters."
4307,7zwjmf,A time when the violence is warranted?

4309,7zwjmf,"There's nothing wrong with that. Benefits are for service rendered over the course of the job, not to be lost for one instance of fear. He probably, rightfully has a lot of guilt and the only real action he can take is to leave the career."
4310,7zwjmf,He was a cop for 30 years...the fact that he didnt face an AR15 proves the point a teacher trained for 3 days never would either...the US has gone to crazy town.

4313,7zwjmf,"Absolutely. But they faced their fate, like the rest of those that served.

Moral objections are one thing, but I put my anti-war philosophy aside when the Twin Towers fell just like tens of thousands of my peers, and to hear a Draft Dodger second-guess ANYONE under actual gun fire is the absolute height of absurdity.

You don't have to love America, but you can't stop us from doing it."

4355,5uuz60,"The free press destroyed itself.

It stopped investigating. It stopped asking tough questions. It stopped doing its job.

Fox was conceptualized as a propaganda wing of the Republican Party. It was and is. CNN and MSN had to compete with the 24 hour news cycle model, and have since devolved into propaganda wings of the democratic party.

Both sides can point out hypocrisy by the other networks. But they're both pushing a bias and fake news bullshit.

I don't  fault Obama and left wing pundits making fun of FOX and pointing out how full of shit they are. And we can't fault Trump for pointing out the same crap by all these networks.

It's all crap. It's all propaganda. The free press committed suicide a decade ago. Turn it off. Get your news somewhere else and quit letting yourself be lied to. Spare me the faux indignation."
4356,5uuz60,"as an outsider, not from the us, just let me tell you one thing.

trump is not the cause of the collapse of your press, he is the result of the collapse"
4357,5uuz60,"Can someone explain to me how when bernie sanders rails against the corporate media and calls it a threat to democracy he's totally spot on, but when trump does it he's a fascist trying to destroy the ""free"" press? Suddenly Corporate media outlets are ""free press"" and not propaganda machines? That's not what I heard throughout most of the primary. "
4358,5uuz60,It's not free press. It's paid for press. By corporations and billionaires. How do you not get that?
4359,5uuz60,He is not trying to destroy Free Press. He has made no action to suppress free speech. Yes he hates mainstream media but the two do not equate. Stop fear-mongering please
4360,5uuz60,"The media used to report on news, now they just clickbait like buzzfeed."
4361,5uuz60,We remember what the independent press was like during the election. We welcome bloodletting throughout the media.

4386,5uuz60,"If they wouldn't constantly lie and take quotes completely out of context while doing everything they possibly can to disrupt the nation at every opportunity, maybe people might actually see what he said as a threat. As of now though, the media has clearly and firmly planted itself in a position that is against the best interests of a large portion of the American people so there will be a lot of people that this message will resonate with."
4387,5uuz60,"I wasn't aware our extreme click bait news on either side was free press. I thought it was bias click bait for cash and destroy all apposing views to established cash, etc.

"
4388,5uuz60,"How is he trying to destroy the free press in this tweet. He is stating that they are Fake News, which honestly I agree with. How can you not agree with that sentiment. I would say the only actual news source I trust on their is ABC or NY Times, and even then they obviously have their problems. Everyone needs to get aquanted with the term Yellow Journalism. Almost every ""news"" source is based around this now. Modern mainstream news is a disgrace, and it isn't like Trump is the first one to call it out. Obama called out Fox and now Trump is calling out left leaning news. Stop crying because your opinion doesn't align with your president. "
4389,5uuz60,"I understand all the hate this receives because it is Trump, and I am not saying the media needs to be censored, but a lot of media outlets have no regard for anyone's well-being. You can go on and on about the way the media covers different topics or attacks specific people. Now more than ever, people need to think very critically about the information they get from different sources."
4390,5uuz60,Hey they could have been honest. They chose a side and it lost. 
4391,5uuz60,"Well the media had been trying to make him fail for a while now. And the only way they can discredit him is through factual reporting, not ""we were attacked at Pearl Harbour, we were attacked on Sep 11, and we were attacked today"" in regards to the Flynn scandal. Like WTF??!  "
4392,5uuz60,he is not entirely wrong though
4393,5uuz60,The press lies. 
4394,5uuz60,Fake news is an issue in all types of reporting
4395,5uuz60,"Cool, still waiting on the DNC to confirm those wikileaks podesta emails are authentic. Thank God we verified them cryptographicly already, because it shows how biased my party actually is. No apology, just russian excuses and slander wikileaks as fake news. Maybe Ill come back to the DNC when Bernie cleans the BS out."
4396,5uuz60,The listed networks entertain for ratings along with several others. I may disapprove of almost everything Trump does but 'news' networks have been out of control in the U.S. since the 1980's.
4397,5uuz60,And what is David Brock doing?
4398,5uuz60,"To be fair, look at the corporations who own some of these networks and they start to look like less friendly names. Comcast being one of them. "
4399,5uuz60,when the us gov fcc? give corporations the go ahead to buy out the media that was the end of the freepress
4400,5uuz60,"I think we understand this. The question is, what do we do about it?"
4401,5uuz60,"The fact he's calling out these organizations that have been peddling extremely biased and in many cases blatantly false stories on purpose for YEARS (as long as I've followed news... so at least the past 12+ years) is not dismantling the free press. You notice there are MANY organizations that he has no problem with, and not just right-wing crazy stuff.

Basically anything that isn't crazy insanely manipulative left-wing propaganda is fine. Anything center is fine.

Calling out half of the troublemakers (admittedly, he is leaving out the right-wing nuthouses) is not dismantling the free press. It's cleaning up (half) of the press. Yes calling out both sides would be better, but I'll take cleaning up the more egregious problem and leave the smaller problem, over doing nothing like past presidents have."
4402,5uuz60,[removed]
4403,5uuz60,"I've seen the media twist one thing or another too many times to trust any of it.

pewdiepie being the most recent example."

**NINETY FIVE PERCENT CHANCE FOR HILLARY TO WIN ! WOOOOOO**"
4405,5uuz60,What free press? You mean those fake free press?
4406,5uuz60,zero fucks were given

4408,5uuz60,"Write your senators. Write them. Quote Trump and ask them if they seriously want to be associated with this guy?

They can cut and run now and have a chance at reelection."
4409,5uuz60,free press according to you is large billon dollar corporations that control every little bit of media they push out?
4410,5uuz60,"Kind of hard to say it's free press when majority of these companies are owned by 6 and are blatantly biased. I'm sure if I went to one of these networks and offer them $1 billion they would go out and declare my message. At the end of the day people need to eat and pay their bills and if they have to lean a message to do that then they will. It's difficult to say the media is ""free"" when they get paid to provide information by someone who tells them what to put out"
4411,5uuz60,maybe you all forgot how the press colluded to railroad bernie throughout the primaries. i haven't. 
4412,5uuz60,"Democrats blaming anyone but themselves, classic. Keep it up and the 8 years meme won't be a meme for too long.

The media killed the media, what's the next excuse going to be? You going to tell me Russia hacked the media? Or did James comey ruin the media? Or maybe it was racism and bigotry, yeah that sounds right. Wait no, it was the alt-right! Punch Nazi's guys!

If you really want to see how garbage the media is from a liberal perspective, look up secular talk, he often calls them out on their crap."
4413,5uuz60,[removed]
4414,5uuz60,The press did this to themselves 
4415,5uuz60,"NBC, ABC, FOX, CNN are not the face of free press. They are the face of press that is taken over by the oligarchs. We all have the freedom to seek independent news on the internet for actual ""free"" press, which is not under attack by Trump."
4416,5uuz60,"He's simply taking a page out of the Republican playbook they've used for years, that is working to discredit the media who oppose them. The smarter Republicans recognize the damage it has done to their base, few trust the media even conservative media. Trump, however, I'm not entirely sure what his strategy is here because a significant part of his base already wildly distrust the media from years of Republicans already driving this campaign. 

The wisest know that both sides of the media are biased and that they must digest from both. Each side of the media works to portray their side in better light than worse and the opposing side in less light than better. Just this time around, Trump makes it rather easy for the non-conservative media. A good portion of people do not digest both sides which explains why a good portion of the conservative base legitimately believes Trumps is more right than wrong. 

Trump will not destroy the press. But he will grow the divide. "
4417,5uuz60,"This is a propaganda tactic with an impact example such as exhibit A:  Trump cites events occurring (falsely) last night in Sweden today at a rally.  Since we know know this was a result of a segment on Fox News:
 
The propaganda goes so deep that no one is catching that Fox News was airing FAKE NEWS by covering a film that itself is making false claims about immigration effects in Sweden.

We should be mad at Fox News for this, then the President, in that order.

The level of propaganda that we are at now is causing us to not question wtf Fox was doing, (media are friends right? Or was it enemy?)

People need to get a hit of super knowledge on the extent of propaganda we are up against.  Some incredible discoveries about how they are being deployed on a technology level was recently reported here.   Reading this might allow you to hang in longer:
https://scout.ai/story/the-rise-of-the-weaponized-ai-propaganda-machine

Already at that other place they are saying liberals are calling Trump a liar because he cited a Fox News 'Report' - passing that report as the 'real news'.

We still punch nazis right?

He hasn't passed any laws, signed any executive orders, filed any lawsuits- the only thing he's doing is whining about it. If you want him to stop whining about the press, tell him to stop being a little bitch. There's no argument to be made that whining limits free press."
4420,5uuz60,Should The Washington Post be relieved or envious that he didn't mention them?
4421,5uuz60,What is he doing outside of Tweeting?
4422,5uuz60,HRC was just as shitty. Proof: Goldman Sachs speaches.
4423,5uuz60,He is actually really good for those organizations. I bet revenue is up across the board
4424,5uuz60,"The revolution has begun! , Stand up, stand your ground, we are in for a wild ride!!!"
4425,5uuz60,"So free that Hillary was awarded a free question to a town hall with Bernie. To their credit, CNN did the right thing AFTER THEY GOT CAUGHT."
4426,5uuz60,Is this everything he could do? Complaining? Tweets? Is that it? Surely he could do more.
4427,5uuz60,"Aren't you exaggerating a little bit?

The difference between Trump and real historic fascists is that Trump has The_Donald while historic fascists had parties behind them. 

The whole recent ""far-right"" resurgence in the Western world (Russia, Austria, France, Italy, US) is just a reaction to the refugee crisis caused by the actions of the West in Middle East - deliberate actions to add fuel to the fire by fighting anything that emerges as a strong future force of the Muslims. 

You have to realize how important organization is in taking over. Bolsheviks had massive organization behind them, Hitler had his party AND stormtroopers. 

Trump is just a one-man act that actual parties will eventually learn how to manipulate into their favor...  "
4428,5uuz60,"> media is

He doesn't even realise that ""media"" is a plural word. "
4429,5uuz60,"Ok I hate to be even remotely pro trump, but did anyone watch his last speech? He didn't say he was anti freedom of speech or anything like that. He said the media was not being truthful. What I saw on reddit was that he declared war on the first amendment.  As someone that for the most part stays out of politics both sides seem full of shit. "
4430,5uuz60,"He's not my president. He's not your president. He's a lie that was packaged and sold to the uneducated and gullible. If the usa don't remove him from office, then its on them for their failure to react"
4431,5uuz60,"If Trump would help set up a proper free press, that'd be one thing, but he's just screaming to destroy the press period. If he succeeds, we're not gonna have any press at all. If some new media company springs up after, he'll blast at it too and kill it asap.

Trump, go home. You're too high these days."
4432,5uuz60,He is literally turning into a parody of himself. This sounds like a fake Trump tweet that I might write as a joke. It would be funny if it wasn't scary.

4436,5uuz60,"Its over Trump, I have the high ground."
4437,5uuz60,"He cannot destroy free press. Journalism is one of the only profesions that is protected by the constitution. A distinction needs to be made clear though, editorialized news is biased news. The FCC ruled back in the 70's that news outlets are allowed to editorialize the news they report. Meaning they are allowed to put a slant on how the news is presented. This was determined to be a right under the freedom of the press. I feel you may be trying to put pressure on the wrong side here. The pressure needs to be put on the news companies to raise their standards by providing high quality, fact checked news. My intentions are not misplaced, it is the news outlets responsibility to do this, not the Americans people's responsibility to convince others."
4438,5uuz60,"Yeah Trump is being petty. But let's not pretend Democrats didn't intimidate journalists and threaten whistleblowers. Remember what they did after Snowden? And then also this: https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/justice-departments-scrutiny-of-fox-news-reporter-james-rosen-in-leak-case-draws-fire/2013/05/20/c6289eba-c162-11e2-8bd8-2788030e6b44_story.html?utm_term=.72fb0eab91c4

They were hellbent on keeping Bernie out, and they are in fact far more comfortable with Trump in the WH than with Bernie or any other true leftist. Now they can talk nonsense about having the moral high ground, and... oh, nevermind.

4453,5uuz60,"You need to concentrate all your efforts on the rural downticket, is what the fuck you need to do. 

This party has all of it's eggs in a half dozen major metropolitan baskets, none of which have enough electoral power to get the job done, which I'm sure you've noticed.

I can't even elect Democrats in my 40k population town because I only have a straight Republican ticket to vote on with no options. That's how hard you've given up on most of your downticket.

Ohio's going to lose its one Democratic Senator in two years if you keep doing what you're doing. One more swing state gone blood red. Your party needs to leave it's urban fortress in a bad way.

So, yay, sure, seize the moral high ground and all that. But protesting and making yourselves feel good in the towns you've already won is just going to leave you in tears like it did last time.

John Boehner called that an ""easy ass election"" and he was right. But you insisted on Clinton, the only person in the world who could possibly lose to this asshole. And most of the nation feels like they never had a party to vote for in the first place.

Here's a stupid idea, maybe concentrate on getting the working class vote back by talking about how you're gonna help them make money. If you want black people to feel like their lives matter, great. Prove it by putting the money in the pocket where the money goes. The whole damn country is feeling broke as hell. Fix that. Make that the only thing you care about.

You have rapidly become the party of rich white college graduates from the city with jobs nobody but you understands. Or worse, they understand your jobs just fine, and that you are nobody's friend. Looking at you, HR department.

You might want to reconsider that. Or maybe you focus on social issues so hard because it's the only spot where you can feel like you have the moral high ground. Maybe dwell on that.

Do you think I came here from That_subredDit to fuck with you? 

I voted for Clinton, Gore, knocked on doors for Big O and you know I voted for him twice, and then voted for Clinton again anyway. 

So how about you all fuck off about waving signs and all this other crap that makes you feel excited and gives you a chance to socialize but doesn't accomplish anything, and concentrate like a laser beam on making sure you have strong Congressional candidates, and *that your voters show up to the polls*.

I would suggest making triple damned sure people know about absentee balloting if their state allows it.

And if you don't do all this out in flyover red state scary country, you are screwed, do you understand? It's not good enough to give up on 80% of the national acreage and just hold your little fiefdoms. Some of you might need to pick up and move back home. Learn how to live without Uber. Drive your own car like some sort of backwards peasant. Realize how fucked most of these towns are since all they've got left are jobs that you are personally going to obsolete with your STEM degree. 

Just because there's a heavy ""screw Trump"" mandate going into this election doesn't mean it automatically goes to you. These are not normal times. Don't pretend like the R's are on their way out while you control a teensy little corner of Congress and fuck all else. Do not get cocky. Do not repeat the mistake Clinton just made. 

You've got a minority of Congress, no President, no more Barack to save you, no damn governors outside of California and a few other states, and most of the country's small town government is controlled by the Red Hand Of Death.

Your pyramid has no bottom, and you are in deep soup. Get your people to the polls in two years, and think small. Think mayors in tiny towns. Hundreds of them. Think state governors, 50 of them. Thousands of small time elected positions, all of which you should be trying to win. All I can do is vote. 

You have to put viable candidates on ballots and back them hard, with money and support, out in the boondocks where all the Democrats have fled.

This next presidential election is not a gimme. You had your gimme. You blew it. You had the Obamas working all of their magic on your behalf and still. The R's were all screaming for Barry's head for 8 years, and somehow he still got his second term. So did Bush before him. It is *unlikely* that Trump will be a 4 year President.

And be nice to the Republicans. I know you don't wanna. I don't either. Every little interaction you have with the other side of the fence is going to determine the course of history. I want you to go watch that last John Stewart video where he talks about how this is still the beautiful America it always was. Be nice. Don't be an asshole on Twitter.

I said don't be an asshole on Twitter.

Do I need to say it again? I hope not. Because if you feel like you can't, then maybe no more Twitter.

I cannot believe the future of the world has come down to that damn website and yet here we are. 

Get your rural voters out to the polls for tiny little elections you don't care about. Make sure they know if they can absentee vote. Make sure they have people they can vote for, and make sure they know their names. Pimp for Govtrack.

I'm out."

4455,5uuz60,It won't matter. His base likes him BECAUSE he's a horrible loser who will burn everything down. :(
4456,5uuz60,Meh...news channels are overrated. Who still watches t.v.? 
4457,5uuz60,"It's really ironic that democrats on reddit blamed the media for the eventual fall of Bernie but now that Trump is saying the same thing, it's no longer true?

Maybe let's get real here and accept that the media in this country is a fucking mess with huge biases and clear agendas beyond the ridiculous profit chasing, low effort, clickbait ""journalism"". 

Trump is an idiot, he might not even have the right intentions but he is right. No fucking way will I defend the media."
4458,5uuz60,"FYI, the paper that had the story on Pewdiepie is owned by the same guy who owns Fox News, Rupert Murdoch.

So that has nothing to do with any of the ones Trump listed, at all."
4459,5uuz60,"Really? Because the only mediums where I've seen the sentence ""Pewdiepie is a nazi"" is Tumblr, and Reddit circlejerking about how fucking oppressed poor Pewdiepie is. The summary of that whole saga should be Sometimes,  Actions Have Consequences. He released shit jokes with racist connotations, and media reported on it. His sponsors didn't like that. End of story. "
4460,5uuz60,"I can't speak to the pewdiepie issue, as I haven't been following it, and it's the type of news I only catch wind of on Reddit. 

That said, please understand how a major news organization works.  There are multiple departments with editorial staff working hard to report the news. If the NYTimes, or the Wall Street Journal ran a story about him, yes, it was probably for your click, because it was in the ""entertainment"" news department of the organization, probably run by someone you'd want to drink a beer with (if not the editor, the actual writer of the piece).  Yes, they are chasing clicks.  This is the reality of not dishing out $1.25 for a newspaper. 

But, in the same organizations, there are a dedicated, independent, group of actual journalists who are chasing and reporting the news as they find it when reporting on news of critical substance.   

I highly recommend that anyone who reads this take advantage of their university or local library's free digital access to the more reputable and established news organizations available.  There's really no need to click through 3 links in a news article to hit bedrock on good reporting. "
4461,5uuz60,"It's not that you can't believe anything; it's that you have to do your own research (in everything).

I can't tell you how many misleading findings I've come across for my career because the people conducting polls have agendas or bias or are pulling from too small of a sampling or are tactically pulling from a specific group to illicit leading results.  I work in data analysis, and there are so many false positives, but where there is a lot of smoke there may be fire.  Especially when coming from multiple resources that I've come to know as reliable, which will prompt me to do my own investigation.

Take everything you see (not just the news) with a grain of salt.  Pewdiepie's case is one of clickbait, which you will find with many of the worst organizations.  

It invalidates a lot of the argument, and even though I am a Democrat, I get pissed off by this sensationalizing shit that some news outlets and shows do.  We need a civil discussion to have Republicans and Independents alike understand where we are coming from.  Not like what the Daily Show has become.  I can't stand the rhetoric they spew:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCRY_tOPQ7Q

That video is the worst example of journalism (which Jon Stewart was able to do deftly, so maybe I am spoiled from his helming of the show).  They had Tomi Lahren on and were able to have a somewhat civil conversation with her, but focusing on dumb shit like Trump's hands or calling him Hitler (which won't reach many Republican's ears at this point) is the wrong approach.

We need to cleanly and simple explain what Trump has lied about, while also acknowledging any shortcomings of the media or anything else he attacks.  There are some outliers, but thankfully not many, so we can turn this discussion to our favor.  It requires that we do the research though, and spend time patiently and calmly discussing with those Trump supporters around us if and when we can."
4462,5uuz60,"It's paid shills and useful idiots. 

Have you heard of the 10% rule? Says only about 10% of people actually participate in social media, the other 90% just watch. Why is this relevant? Well it makes the internet an easy platform to game. There is monetary incentive for companies to use web crawlers to monitor what people are saying about them and to control their public image using bots and shill accounts. 

Monsanto did this a lot a few years ago when people started to question their business practices. Not only would you get downvoted for saying anything negative about Monsanto, but you would get called an idiot conspiracy theorist too (and many other not so nice things). That way anyone who questions monsanto will automatically be lumped in with anti-GMO and anti-Vax nut jobs. Monsanto doesn't seem to be nearly as active as they once were.  Lot's of companies do similar things especially Microsoft. And to be clear, these companies don't have shilling departments themselves, they outsource to third parties (the way the Clinton campaign used Correct the Record). 

The same thing is happening now with BLM/SJW culture vs alt-right culture, except instead of controlling their public image, they're attempting to shape the social and political narrative. And it's not just them, lots of organizations are competing to control the narrative. BLM mostly consists of ""useful idiots"" -- people who have no idea what they're fighting for but just want to latch onto a cause. government organizations (NSA, KGB, Etc..) are also attempting to shape the narrative. Oh and we can't forget organizations like ISIS too. 

The worst part is, many of the elites are in on it, they know it's happening. they know the things we see on social media/the internet are all being controlled by competing organizations and aren't organic, yet they ignore it because they are hoping that the narrative they are pushing will win out. 

Russian spy organizations and American spy organizations (and spy organizations from every other country) are able to use bots and sock-puppets, but also hack into peoples digital lives and steal personal information used to black mail them. Most of our politicians are idiots who don't understand technology, they're sitting ducks. Politicians, celebrities, leaders of BLM, etc, are all vulnerable  to being blackmailed and doing someone elses bidding, especially in the days of the internet. 

Our security organizations aren't security organizations, they don't keep us secure, they keep us insecure so that we can be hacked and blackmailed. 

Most race relations in the US are the result of Russian interference:

- Russia uses state sponsored shilling to game and control social media like Reddit and 4chan. They do this to try to control the political and social narrative to create a culture of unrest. They are responsible for the ""SJW"" authoritarian culture that the alt right complains about and they are responsible for stirring up the alt-right by exposing them to anti-white media.

- It's not just paid shills by Russia, the US and many other nations (UK, Germany, China, Israel, ""Five-eyes"", and many more), organizations (Microsoft, Apple, ISIS, Monsanto, Big Oil, etc), and individuals (trolls, idiots, crazy people).

- There are also some people being manipulated into believing that there is widespread hatred of white culture by non-whites and non-white culture by whites, these people further exacerbate the problem and are what's known as ""useful idiots"".

- The emergence of so called ""socialist"" sub-reddits is the result of anti-western forces likely being controlled by Russia to cause people to lose faith in capitalism and vote for more monolithic social programs or get rid of the American business culture altogether.

- There is a world wide cyber war happening right this minute as you read this, it's been ongoing for some time, and it's about to get ramped up.

- The goal of Russia is to de-stabilize the west and especially the US

**BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS COMPETING TO CONTROL THE NARRATIVE AND NOTHING ON THE INTERNET REPRESENTS THE WAY THE 90% OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T POST AT ALL FEEL.**

We're being manipulated. The best thing we can do is try to make sure everyone understands that this is how the internet works, so that at least they are aware and can question the groupthink.

I doubt very few people read only these sources and not also various blogs, FB groups, and subreddits that reinforce their ideological beliefs. 

Trump is not trying to break up an information monopoly, nor is he attacking his harshest critics (far left wing sites like Daily Kos are much harsher to him than the sources he lists here) he is trying to destroy the only media mainstream enough that it is consumed by people regardless of what bubble they are in.

4497,5uuz60,"Except ""fake news"" is not equitably spread across all reporting, it is concentrated in the far right.

Also - your statement has zero to do with the fact that Trump is labeling fact based, well sourced, journalism ""fake news"" based purely on the basis of him not liking the content and believing it portrays him in an unfavorable light. He also does the reverse, which is the promotion of news articles and obscure bloggers who are blatantly making shit up (no, the unemployment rate is not 50%, 3 million illegals did not vote, and Hillary Clinton did not give Russia 20% of US uranium supplies) because they support his untruthful narrative. The man is a liar. Lots of politicians lie for various purposes, but nobody has ever lied in terms of scope like Trump does, nor do they lie about petty, useless shit like how many people were at his inauguration. He could have painted that answer honestly and still met his goals. I am no public relations professional, but he could have said something like, ""There are a high number of Democrats living in the Washington D.C. and northern Virginia area, and many more limosuine liberals who could afford to take a day off work and travel to DC to see Obama inagurated. My support is from a strapped middle class that has seen their jobs sent to Mexico and China, the sort of hard working folks who cant necessarily take a long weekend to our capitol because they have been ignored, mistreated, and cast aside. Also, it was raining.""

As soon as the story broke White House staff immediately denounced it as fake. AP was doing their jobs as journalists, and it genuinely sounds like they were set up.

There is absolutely a concerted effort to delegitimize the media, and people need to be aware of it. The press is calling Trump out on his lies, but he just declares everything ""fake news"".

It talks about how Disney ended their relationship with Pewdiepie because of anti-Semitic jokes and imagery in his videos. That's 100% what happened (full disclosure I don't pay for WSJ so I've only seen the free part). He paid two guys to hold up a sign that said ""death to all Jews"". Do you think Disney wants that shit on their network? Pewdiepie also posted [this Tweet](http://archive.is/sKiji) in which somebody asks him ""When did you become a Nazi?"" to which he replied ""aryan, superior genetics since birth"". Now I'm totally on board with that all just being (kinda shitty) jokes. But again, it's fucking Disney. He should understand that if he wants to be associated with Disney he can't have that shit going on. It's common sense.

The only thing that is remotely WSJ's responsibility in this, is that they contacted Disney (presumably to ask for a comment) about the anti-Semitic content on Pewdiepie's channel. But getting mad about that is basically calling them tattle tales. Pewdiepie's an adult and he (and no one else) is responsible for what he does and says. 

Again, to restate: dropping Pewdiepie was Disney's decision. Putting Nazi shit on his channel was Pewdiepie's decision. If you want to work with Disney it's common sense that ""death to all Jews"" is not a smart thing to put on your channel. End of story.   "

He used a video of Hitler and compared it to the YouTube Heroes program saying the program was like Hitler by recruiting users to report videos. The WSJ used that against him.

He created a video showing gamers creating swastikas on the walls in his gameplay and told them to stop writing swastikas - the entire video was ""Stop writing swastikas in my games"". The WSJ used footage of that against him as supporting evidence for their claims.

He even just lifted his hand in the air (with his hand not in the shot) and they used that footage too.

First topic: H3H3 and PhillyD. I am also a fan of h3h3, and I think he's really funny, along with idubbbz. Frankly, I don't think they have added much substance to this issue. The points I saw were basically ""I know he isn't anti-semitic,"" and ""He's a comedian and they took him out of context."" I don't think these points have much merit. He isn't anti-semitic, but he is pushing graphic language onto the screens of children. Saying ""oh, he's a comedian"" really ignores the makeup of his audience. This isn't Patton Oswalt or Dave Chapelle, this is PewDiePie, maybe parents OK-ed him out 3 months ago, before he took up this new 'bit.'  
I think most other Youtubers are obviously gonna take his side, it's always convenient for artists to say all art is fair. Idubbbz had an interesting point recently, which was (paraphrasing him after he said the N-word): ""If she called me out for lazy, immature jokewriting, I wouldn't have a response."" That's what this is, and it certainly doesn't handle a sensitive issue with the respect it deserves.

Second Point: Gamer. I really disagree. He obviously isn't just a gamer, and even if he were, I hardly think Xbox live chat should be the moral benchmark to which we hold children's entertainers.

Third Point: Words only matter if we let them. I couldn't disagree more. Maybe you are Jewish, maybe you are ok with people making these ""jokes"" around you (I'm being pretentious and quoting ""joke"" because all he did was have people who barely speak english repeat horrible things). Do you think we should be ok with this message reaching 10, 9, 8 year old Jewish children? Is there anything that shouldn't be said? What about less obvious 'jokes' like ""we need to kick <racial slur> out of the country""?

>the EO bring unconstitutional

Religious tests for immigration are unconstitutional, so Trump's EO probably is too.

Steve Bannon *is* a racist."
4745,5uuz60,"All those stories are almost certainly true. 

Regarding disarray in the White House, three members of Trump's team have resigned, including the head of the national security council (Flynn). The guy Trump chose to replace Flynn (Harward) turned the job down. Those are facts, they're not fake, they're not lies. It's the truth.

Regarding the national guard story, the leaked memo the media based their stories on is right [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3467508-Trump-National-Guard-Draft-Memo.html). The WH claims it was never seriously considered, but somebody clearly considered it enough to write it.

The ""EO being unconstitutional"" isn't even a news story. It's the decision of the court that ruled on it. You can disagree with their ruling but it's not the media saying it's unconstitutional, it's the judges -- incidentally, judges are the people who decide what is constitutional.

Regarding Flynn, this is where I'm going to call you out: You get your news from Breitbart, don't you? Breitbart ran a story recently that claimed Flynn hadn't broken any laws and was completely cleared. **That was a fake news story.** The FBI's investigation is ongoing, but Flynn at the very least violated the Logan Act (doubtful he'd see criminal charges for that but it's still true).

2 - The shooter is a felon, and it was illegal for him to own that rifle in the first place.  Your argument should form around closing the issue of the incorrect approval from the FBI response.  He should have came back flagged as denied, it wasn’t.  THAT is the problem here that needs to be fixed."

The recommendation was to address mass shootings  by cutting off the incentive to start one in the first place, which makes a lot of sense, as it is hard to subject these individuals to therapy before they commit violent acts (since they wouldn't go themselves, and others may not notice), and having people shooting each other with, say, shotguns isn't really an improvement."

Because who is going to determine who is so mentally ill that they deserve to have their 2nd amendment rights taken away, and furthermore, how would that even be determined?

Your solution is basically a less extreme version of giving everyone a 9 pm curfew. Sure the crime rate would go down a lot, but you'd be taking away peoples rights and freedom. You clearly choose security over freedom in this case (and likely most cases) whereas most people choose freedom over security.

Well, according to [this article](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-set-overturn-guns-mental-health-regulation-557237)...

> Within his first two months as president, Donald Trump repealed without public display an Obama administration gun regulation that prevented certain individuals with mental health conditions from buying firearms.

Since the majority of gun related deaths are suicides, any reasonable gun control policy should address mentally ill and especially potentially suicidal individuals - the very group Trump deregulated when it came to the ownership of guns.  Taking Trump at his word, isn't the better question:

4835,7b4roi,"These are the issues that make me drift from the left side so often. I have a personal stake in the arguments put forth by discussing gun control and the democrats ideas on curbing freedoms is scary to me. People talk about the republicans not wanting to store a bunch of data on people to make instantaneous background checks easier, but then they complain that some dem politician signed legislation to monitor people's communications or some shit. I was a hard left leaning person. I still am I think, I support things like basic income and a form of socialized healthcare. But apparently I'm on the right because I believe that if you want to qualify for state or federal aid, you have to do something for it(like mandatory community service until you can find a job that will pay you your livable wage on top of basic income, if you can't afford your food and housing after basic income, you're fucking up and that's on you.) 

Gun rights too, I'm a felon from a car accident I got in when I was 17. I'm not a violent person, never had any other charges beside a marijuana possession charge recently. I would have zero issues obtaining a firearm. They are everywhere. I could literally have one today. The law says I am not allowed to have one so I do not own one, nor do I plan to until it is legal for me to do so, but there's my issue. I feel like I would be a responsible gun owner and I have faith that I will get my rights back someday. Maybe 30 years from now but then I can at least go hunting. But because of a situation out of my control when I was 17 I have to relinquish my rights to bare arms. 

What if society collapses here in America? What if Trump gets impeached and his millions of loyal followers decide that America was stolen from them and we delve into a second civil war? Do I just hope me and my family is safe? Do I go illegally obtain a weapon to protect myself and my loved ones? Do I just say fuck it and let someone decide to take my life because I ran a stop sign I couldn't see when I was a kid and caught a felony?

Seems to be a common theme that the laws we have in place would help, but the lack of enforcement allows these things to slip through. "
4838,7b4roi,"It's also incredibly shitty to suggest that people with mental health issues should have their rights specifically taken away.

1) It stigmatizes mental health even further, meaning people are less likely to seek help due to the social stigma.

4843,7b4roi,On point 1) the AR15 meets the Former (AWB1995) definition of an Assault Weapon. If does not meet the definition of Assault Rifle (aka machine gun NFA1934). In many states the AR15 is an “assault weapon” which is a cosmetic term.

4845,7b4roi,"I don't know if he was a felon, but he was definitely convicted of a crime of domestic violence and was dishonorably discharged from the military, which are both prohibited categories. But, if he purchased a gun before those things happened, a background check is irrelevant. "

4847,7b4roi,"1. Assault rifle is a fairly meaningless term, and due to semantic drift has become largely synonymous with assault weapon.

I see your point – but recharacterizing/renaming things is a hallmark of Republican politics, and it works really well. It's one reason Republicans beat the shit out of Democrats on some issues, even when they're on the shitty side.

Obamacare. Death Tax. Etc… 

If saying Assault Rifle gets folks' attention, then say Assault Rifle, even if it's technically not correct. Gun enthusiasts may know ""Well technically Assault Rifles have this and this, and…"" – it doesn't matter. AR15's and other guns like it are generally unnecessary in everyday life, and have been used a ton in mass shootings. 

I know that #notAllGunOwners use them for murder. 99% don't. But the argument that some dampening of generally available firepower isn't outrageous. 

And using the label ""Assault Rifles"" to talk about military-style weapons is easy for non-gun folks to understand and mobilize behind."

I disagree with your statement that ""no amount of gun laws will stop people from illegally obtaining guns,"" because a **waiting period** to review the background check would have certainly prevented this. 

Even if he lied about his previous felonies, a background check and waiting period would have revealed that he was not permitted to purchase a firearm, thus preventing the sale of the firearm. 

With that being said, clearly this company should hold responsibility for illegally selling this firearm to Kelley. But in Texas, background checks are **not** required for private sales, nor are **state permits**. 

So yes, gun laws would have prevented this from happening, because the gun was purchased ILLEGALLY from a LEGAL retailer, without any government overview of the transaction, or background check required for the transaction.

4870,7b4roi,"Nothing is perfect, and you’ll always have some out there illegally obtaining guns.

4885,7b4roi,"He purchased the rifle in April 2016, 4 years after being dishonorably discharged. So no, he didn't already have the gun."
4886,7b4roi,He purchased the gun legally.
4887,7b4roi,"It might have been technically illegal but the lax gun laws in Texas most likely allowed him to buy the gun without background checks in a private vendor.

Aka we need stricter gun laws. Not take them all away, but make it less easy for someone to own a gun when that person shouldn't fucking own a gun "
4888,7b4roi,"""Have you ever been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence?"" Is already one of the questions of the federal 4473 form to be filled out when purchasing a gun. If you lie and answer ""no"" (which would itself be perjury) the background check should come back as denied, no sale.

If you have a domestic violence charge on your record and answer truthfully as a ""yes"" the firearms dealer halts the sale.

This is what is supposed to happen to the best of my understanding."
4889,7b4roi,"Since when does ""we failed to do X"" mean ""oh well, X is impossible, give up now""?

You got passed over for your first job application.  Did you go on welfare forever because getting a job is just impossible?"

4910,7b4roi,"I'm giving the OP the benefit of the doubt and assuming he means ""unstable"" or ""violent"" mental illnesses. If that's the case the it's unfortunate but they have a legitimate case for taking your guns taken away. In the same vein that we can't allow blind people to drive, or pedophiles to interact with children, we also can't allow people who aren't in control of their actions to have access to something like firearms. It's irresponsible. 

There are shades of gray and I don't want to go over every single ""what if"" scenario that could play out from my statement, but my main point is that just because something isn't your fault doesn't mean you get to put other people in danger."

I don't agree with that. 

In my opinion people who are not able or less skilled to do a certain activity, should simply don't do it.
That should also apply to various occupational fields: Not everyone has to be a software engineer, bus driver or a doctor.
But under all circumstances you should not be considered a worse human being if you are not gifted enough in a certain area.

4921,7b4roi,"The checks already *are* instantaneous. It's the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

Electronic records would be used for things like firearm *traces*, where instead of going through the manufacturer to FFL to first-point of sale via paper records, they would use an electronic database. Past the first point of sale, it becomes nigh impossible to trace firearms but, the current system will lead you back to a straw buyer or crooked FFL most of the time.

But seeing as how the average 'time to crime' (time between when someone buys a firearm and when they use it to commit a crime) for a firearm is something like 11 years, I'm not sure I see how this extra level of protection for the anonymity and privacy of legal firearm owners is a serious issue. It certainly doesn't have any bearing on criminal use of firearms."

4923,7b4roi,"""Assault rifle"" refers to a select-fire (between semi and full auto) magazine fed infantry weapon.  ""Assault Weapon"" is a term which had no meaning until anti-gun legislators made it up, and is defined by generally irrelevant cosmetic features. The similarity between the terms is intentionally misleading. 

""Assault"" itself is a generally a behavior more than it is a type of equipment."
4924,7b4roi,"They released the specs and configuration of the rifle?

Link? I have not seen that info yet, and since you are saying that this AR15 would have been classed an assault weapon you have seen the configuration of his rifle

4925,7b4roi,NFA does not include the term Assault Rifle anywhere.  It’s a phrase in common usage so it means whatever people think it means.
4926,7b4roi,Whether he is a felon is irrelevant because he was Courtmartialed. He cannot and could not legally purchase firearms. 
4927,7b4roi,Nope he's still not a felon people just keep citing that he was a felon since it was one of the first things to come out to defend gun rights but has been proven wrong already
4928,7b4roi,"""They did it wrong before so it's okay to keep doing it wrong now"". Sick logic "
4929,7b4roi,"And yet it's the same reason why pro-gun folks do not trust democrats with gun control, because they can't even be bothered to use the right terms. If they don't understand guns, how can they be trusted to pen fair and effective restrictions? Knowingly calling it an assault rifle when it is not is being ill-informed at best and misinformation at worst. Intentionally using misinformation for political purposes results in distrust from anyone who knows better."
4930,7b4roi,"This is the usual process.

Dems: Okay, that was brutal. Maybe it's time to start talking about how we can keep guns from being so freely available.

Dems: Okay, well maybe there's some reasonable legislation we can think about with gun ...

And of all things, a legal gun owner pulled out his gun and shot the shooter causing him to flee and helping save some lives within the church."
4938,7b4roi,So the solution to that is making it 60 million uninsured and cutting medicaid?
4939,7b4roi,How could your premiums double if you already had Tricare? You either have Tricare or not. You can't have Obamacare one day and then go out and purchase Tricare the next. I think you are attempting to criticize Obamacare with nothing to back up your accusations. 
4940,7b4roi,The ACA has problems but there must be a fix that doesn't cause 30 million people to be uninsured . That fix will cost money and the rich might have to wait for their tax cuts or lord forbid pay more. We all may end up paying more but we will save on the other side with the cost of our health care. 
4941,7b4roi,"> when Obamacare came around my premiums and deductibles more than doubled.

Then how are you paying premiums/deductibles? If you are retired, then you're covered through a modified version of TriCare."

4943,7b4roi,"I do wonder what the dishonorable discharge was for. I imagine they would've done a psych eval. A rudimentary one is required at entrance.

But as usual the military is being silent. "
4944,7b4roi,"Well we can't force people to go to the doctor. My friend actually refuses to go to the doctor to get help with his depression. Instead he chooses to go the private route. He avoids the doctor *just* so he doesn't have ""pre-existing condition"" on his record for insurance."
4945,7b4roi,"That would require someone go in, or making it mandatory."
4946,7b4roi,"There are free community mental health clinics, but I’m not sure what the wait times or quality of them are. Maybe someone else can chime in. "
4947,7b4roi,There are programs out there. A lot of mental illness goes untreated and leads to homelessness (in my area anyways). The wait for mental healthcare appointments can be months. 
4948,7b4roi,"Sorry, I should correct that. Nobody has been killed with ANY fully automatic capable weapons in the US since 1932."
4949,7b4roi,"A person who is legally allowed to sell firearms who decided not to follow the law. What the salesman did is against the law. The most simple universal background check in the States is the FBIs NICS, and they would have told the salesman that the guy is banned from owning a firearm as soon as his social security number was ran which is within the first 30 seconds of your phone call with the FBI. No amount of new gun control would have stopped that illegal sale from going through. If you want to take issue with something take issue with the fact that all the people he is friends with on Facebook don’t understand our current gun laws to the point that they failed to report him to police when he was posting his rifle on Facebook while knowing he was dishonorably discharged which bans you from owning firearms."
4950,7b4roi,If this was the case this retailer should be thrown in jail and all his recent sales should be checked.
4951,7b4roi,"Most guns used in crimes are bought from a low percentage of gun dealers, why not go after those crappy gun dealers?

"
4952,7b4roi,"https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/nics

You seem to not understand how a firearm purchase works. Go read about NICS and form 4473. "
4953,7b4roi,"If he purchased it from Academy he would have had to pass a background check. Every time, every state.  

just to address this:
>because a waiting period to review the background check would have certainly prevented this.

A background check takes as long as it takes, if you have an uncommon name it could be 5 minutes, if not it could be 45+.  It takes however long it takes to return the information, a waiting period is useless and afaik has never been shown to do anything.  The valid question is why didn't his DV conviction show up on his background check, my guess is that its because it was in a military court but that would just be conjecture and we have way too much of that going around today."
4954,7b4roi,"There are already provisions in place for the waiting period you describe. When you request a NICS check, you can get one of three responses: ""Proceed"", ""Refuse"", and ""Hold"".  A proceed response allows the seller to complete the sale immediately. A refuse response prohibits the sale entirely. A hold response gives law enforcement up to three days to provide a proceed or refuse response. If they fail to provide any response after the ""hold"", the sale is allowed to continue. (This prevents a de facto gun ban by simply de-funding the NICS system.)

If the sale continues without a proceed response, and it is later discovered the buyer is prohibited, law enforcement can recover the firearm and charge the buyer. 

None of that happened. Despite his ~~felony~~ *domestic violence* conviction, he **passed** the background check.

That texas does not mandate background checks for private sales is irrelevant, because he **passed** such a check. 


What needs to happen now is an audit of the NICS system. If they didn't know about his conviction, we need regulations for reporting such convictions to NICS. If they did know and failed to refuse the check, someone needs to lose their job, and possibly be charged for their negligence. 


"
4955,7b4roi,"A waiting period is unnecessary to perform a background check, which only takes a few minutes.  Also, it's very unlikely that Academy didn't perform a background check, as that is a major infraction that can have their FFL license revoked.  It's more likely the background check failed because the DOD didn't report the information to the FBI."
4956,7b4roi,"A waiting period or universal checks would do fuckall when someone probably didn't put the flag in the system in the first place.  He bought from 4 different retailers, including one in Colorado, all of which are required to do background checks.  He was denied his CHL so he couldn't use that either.    

If they did sell the gun illegally, they will most likely lose their FFL but I can't see 4 places all selling a single gun illegally at great risk to themselves, especially a chain store like Academy."
4957,7b4roi,">That’s not the point of gun control- it’s to create barriers to entry. If you restrict access, it will drive price up for illegally owned weapons and price many people out of the market.

Yes because making drugs illegal created such a large barrier to entry that the price was driven so high that no one does drugs anymore. It didn't incentivize a black market or anything.

/s"
4958,7b4roi,You've never purchased drugs have you?
4959,7b4roi,"The system that is currently in place already made it illegal for the shooting suspect to own a gun.  He illegaly obtained it. No vetting system would of prevented this, it would only effect law abiding citizens."
4960,7b4roi,"A BCD or Dishonorable Discharge from the military classifies the recipient as a Felon at the Federal level. The Form 4473 (ATF form for transfer of a firearm) specifically asks that question.

Your comment is wrong

18 USC 922(g)(6) and (9) say that you're wrong. "
4962,7b4roi,It's illegal to sell an AR-15 to a fellon. No amount of laws is going to stop people from illegally obtaining things as is blatantly obvious with the war on drugs. 
4963,7b4roi,"""presidence"" LOL
"
4964,7b4roi,"The gun might not be registered to somebody, but it can still be traced back to the last person who bought it from a licensed dealer and they will have to explain how a felon got their hands on it. And this guy bought it from a licensed dealer so until we know all the details on whether or not he was allowed to own a gun we can't decide about what should be done. If he was allowed we should update who can and cannot own a gun and if he wasn't allowed to own a gun we need to investigate why the background check didn't flag him."
4965,7b4roi,"There is no western country comparable to America even if you magically make every gun disappear. The country is messed up in many ways. If American gun laws were introduced in Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands there wouldn't be  a noticeable difference in the amount of mass shootings those countries have."
4966,7b4roi,">If we start holding dealers and manufacturers liable for gun deaths, they'll be a lot more careful about who gets them.

Should we hold home depot responsible for the truck attack that occurred last week in NYC? Should we hold the truck manufacturers responsible every time someone drives one of their trucks into a crowd?

What if someone uses a gun consisting of parts made from different manufacturers who will you blame?"
4967,7b4roi,Legal M16's are expensive. Illegal conversion kits for semi autos aren't that expensive. You don't see taht many illegally converted AR15's in mass shootings because they aren't worth it if you have to carry your ammo.
4968,7b4roi,next level sarcasm here

4970,7b4roi,Do you have a link?
4971,7b4roi,"But he did have it illegally, which is to say our enforcement could use some brushing up on. "
4972,7b4roi,I didn't say he already had it I'm saying his possession of the gun was illegal.
4973,7b4roi,He was a violent felon barred from possessing firearms. There was no way for him to purchase it legally.
4974,7b4roi,Dudes a felon so it's illegal.
4975,7b4roi,"The problem is, a *history* of domestic violence and a *record* of domestic violence are very different things.  You can't conflate them.

Tons of people have a *history* of it and should not be allowed to purchase weapons.

Far less have a legal record, or a conviction."
4976,7b4roi,"The vendor he bought it from ignored federal NCIS checks. If the checks were done properly, he would have been flagged for no sale.

4982,7b4roi,I heard that the Air Force did not send the proper paperwork to the FBI to put him on the list.

But don’t pretend that there aren’t people who absolutely what to ban anything even remotely gun-shaped, because there certainly are, and they would very much love to use the momentum of any other gun bills to further that end.

More often “the left” and “the right” are presented as monoliths negatively which is incorrect and frankly silly, while here you’re presenting the left as a benevolent monolith, which is just as incorrect and silly.

If both “sides” (in reality mostly just people with the same goal who disagree on how to get there) refuse to acknowledge the existence of the extreme poles and fail to seek to mitigate them poisoning the dialogue, nothing will happen, as has indeed been the case.

The policies of many on the right are unfortunately at the root of a lot of the causes of violence, which is exacerbated by guns, but as an extremely liberal gun owner, let me tell you that the policies of many (not all) on the left are often very poorly thought out, fail to try to make incremental improvements without unduly restricting constitutional rights, and are often enough attempts at end-runs around due process and actually meaningful reform."

5008,7b4roi,"I'm a die hard 2nd Amendment supporter, but completely agree with your assessment. The healthcare debate is looking more like a cold war with the poor being used as pawns. 

The fact is everyone, or the vast majority, wants a society full of healthy people. The way of doing this is either universal healthcare provided by the government or a health insurance system that works the way it is supposed to. 

The health insurance system would be ideal since competition would theoretically lower cost and improve quality. But that hasn't happened. Instead manipulative billing, unrealistic prices, and the possibility of still ending up bankrupt even with insurance all point to that system failing. 

The alternative is government provided healthcare available to anyone, which sounds like a paradise, but is vulnerable to the same price gouging as private insurers. 

There needs to be a complete reform of medical care in the US before either system will work. Incentivize people to *prevent* illness, instead of just run to a doctor to treat it. 

That type of change won't happen with the stroke of a legislator's pen though. The first step I would like to see is some kind of tax credit or subsidy for things like gym memberships, diet or nutritional programs, pet ownership, ethics courses, etc.

The (crucial) difference is that nobody is forcing you to pay for others' guns (defense spending doesn't count), and nobody has ever suggested it.

EDIT: I'm not taking a stance on healthcare subsidies or insurance, just pointing out that pretending healthcare isn't available in the same manner as handguns is dishonest."

5012,7b4roi,I thiught the discharge was for domestic violence.
5013,7b4roi,"He wasn't dishonorably discharged but rather a bad conduct discharge. It was for assault on his wife and child. He spent a year in 'jail' and was demoted to an E1. The bad conduct discharge wouldn't land him in any danger of not being able to purchase a gun, but the assault conviction would as long as it was reported to the FBI. If it wasn't reported then he could lie (which is illegal) on the form and say he was never convicted and the background check would go through. "
5014,7b4roi,"He did time in the brig, so whatever he was discharged for was criminal. If he was simply unfit, that wouldn't be the case."

What are the consequences of what this salesman did? Also how would the law figure out that he sold a gun illegally? Are there checks in place for that?"
5017,7b4roi,"Do we know he was actually denied during the background check though?


Just because we know now he wasn't supposed to be approved doesn't mean he wasn't approved during the check."
5018,7b4roi,"> No amount of new gun control would have stopped that illegal sale from going through.

So is the seller going to be prosecuted? Do authorities invest resources in finding and arresting these kinds of crooked sellers? Do they do random undercover stings where they try to buy guns with bad background records and see if the seller sells it anyways?

There are things that can be done. We can never stop them 100%, but it can be made harder to get away with and reduce the number of these happening. Just saying there's nothing that can be done is not acceptable."
5019,7b4roi,"I haven't seen this yet, but has it been shown that the gun seller didn't do a background check on him? One person was speculating that the military court didn't report the assault conviction to the FBI and that is where things went wrong.

If the sales man didn't run a background and illegally sold the gun to him then he is partly responsible for this and should have his license removed and he should be barred from selling guns again, which could help in the future. 

If it is shown that the assault conviction wasn't reported to the FBI then that issue needs to be fixed.

>If you want to take issue with something take issue with the fact that all the people he is friends with on Facebook don’t understand our current gun laws to the point that they failed to report him to police when he was posting his rifle on Facebook while knowing he was dishonorably discharged which bans you from owning firearms.

You don't have to report on facebook your military discharge type so... how are ""all"" of them suppose to know that? Or did he mention it on there? 

A non honorable discharge is something most people wouldn't want others (even family) to know about and I could see many people not realizing the issue. 

BTW he wasn't dishonorably discharged, he received a bad conduct discharge which doesn't cause you to be banned from owning firearms on its own. It would be the assault conviction that would. A BCD could be for a lot of different things, including many non violent crimes."

5031,7b4roi,"A Bad Conduct Discharge and a Dishonorable Discharge are two completely different things. 

Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD)[edit]
A Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD), can only be given by a court-martial (either special or general) as punishment to an enlisted service-member. Bad conduct discharges are often preceded by a period of confinement in a military prison. The discharge itself is not executed until completion of both confinement and the appellate review process.

Virtually all veterans' benefits are forfeited by a Bad Conduct Discharge; BCD recipients are not eligible for VA disability compensation in accordance with 38 CFR 3.12.

Dishonorable[edit]
A dishonorable discharge (DD) can only be handed down to an enlisted member by a general court-martial. Dishonorable discharges are handed down for what the military considers the most reprehensible conduct. This type of discharge may be rendered only by conviction at a general court-martial for serious offenses (e.g., desertion, sexual assault, murder, etc.) that call for dishonorable discharge as part of the sentence.

With this characterization of service, all veterans' benefits are lost, regardless of any past honorable service, and this type of discharge is regarded as shameful in the military. In many states a dishonorable discharge is deemed the equivalent of a felony conviction, with attendant loss of civil rights.[16] Additionally, US federal law prohibits possession of firearms by those who have been dishonorably discharged[17] per the Gun Control Act of 1968."
5032,7b4roi,"He wasn’t a felon, what part of tried in a military court don’t you get?"
5033,7b4roi,He wasn’t a felon. 
5034,7b4roi,"I’m speaking in general, not about the specific circumstances of this case. Mass shootings get a lot of attention, but we have 9000 gun homicides per year in this country, so I don’t think the circumstances of a single mass shooting should be guiding our gun policy. "
5035,7b4roi,"Ah yes the wonderful ""the US is per se filled with more murderous citizens than the rest of the world"". It's definitely that, nothing at all to do with all the guns. Nope definitely not the guns. Actually we probably need more guns. If we had more guns we could use guns to stop the guns. Buy guns. "

5042,7b4roi,"The caliber of a bullet is its diameter, expressed in either millimeters or decimal inches.  It doesn't really tell you very much about how powerful it is.  .22lr versus .223 Rem looks something like this:

- .22lr moves at 1,500 feet per second, with 150 foot-pounds of energy

- .223 Rem moves at 3,200 feet per second with 1,300 foot-pounds of energy

Among rifle cartridges, .223 Rem is on the low end as far as power goes (in most places, it's illegal to hunt deer with it due to a lack of reliable stopping power).  On the other hand, .22lr is the overall weakest commonly-used firearm cartridge.

For comparison, .30-06, a common deer-hunting cartridge, moves at 2,800 feet per second with 2,900 foot-pounds of force."

A typical .223 has an energy of 1,796 joules.

5045,7b4roi,He fucking beat his wife and child and a military court convicted him and he sat in a military prison for a year. His ability to buy guns was allowed because apparently you can lie on an application and not get caught until after you murder dozens. How about fixing this?
5046,7b4roi,"I understand these people are sick and that it's not their fault, just like any other physical disease. I still can't support allowing unstable persons to own firearms. Before you make any more assumptions, ""mental illness"" is an *extremely* broad spectrum and I can't possibly speak to every facet to even *begin* to defend which illness means you lose your guns. So I won't. 


1. If the mental illness causes uncontrollable violent tendencies then they shouldn't have guns. I left it vague for a reason, I'm not a medical professional and I assume you aren't either so those choices aren't ours to make.

2. Again, not a medical health professional or a lawyer/politician. I'm not familiar enough with the law nor am I willing to put in the hours it would take to make a cogent argument. I am also not trying to defend any law currently in place. I'm simply stating my opinion: if your sickness makes you unable to control yourself, you don't get to own a gun."
5047,7b4roi,"Your questions cannot be answered because individual mental illnesses are not addressed. What is addressed are things like being involuntarily committed to a mental institution, being found not guilty of a crime due to an Insanity​ plea or communicating to a psychotherapist a serious threat of physical violence to a reasonably identifiable individual. Can you please tell us all what specific portion of gun legislation against the mentally ill you consider broad?"
5048,7b4roi,Good point and definitely agree on this.
5049,7b4roi,Except themselves.
5050,7b4roi,"Ok so let’s use your logic. Depression is a mental illness and if severe enough could lead someone to commit suicide. Should someone with that level of depression be allowed to buy a gun whilst they are suffering from their depression? The answer is of course no they should not be able to buy a gun. The same could be said of someone suffering from a different mental illness who either because of their personality or their illness who wants to harm others they definitely shouldn’t be allowed to buy a gun. 

It’s funny that you use people who wear corrective lenses driving as a comparison to this issue because that’s exactly how this should be treated. Not all people who wear corrective lenses can’t drive and not all who wear them can, some need to have them on at all times and some don’t need them to drive.  That is exactly how we should treat the mentally ill in regards to owning a gun; not all of them should be allowed to. Some should not be allowed to temporarily, some never, and some shouldn’t have any issues "
5051,7b4roi,I sure do - the United States has legislation that implies it!

5060,7b4roi,"A handgun costs 100$ on the low end, I can’t even see a dr for that. You’re comparing apples to SUVs here. Just because someone can buy something doesn’t make it equally purchasable. 

For instance counting insurance premiums I have to pay 10,000$ before my insurance STARTS to cover at 75-25. So yea, buying a gun is a fuck ton easier than getting healthcare and that’s kind of backwards. 

It’s sad that it’s cheaper and easier to kill yourself with a twelve gauge than get treatment for depression."
5061,7b4roi,"I pay for the increase in healthcare costs from gun violence/accidents through insurance. I pay for the lawmakers who offer thoughts and prayers instead of working on viable things to help the problem.

I know that's nitpicking, and not the same as socialized healthcare, but at the same time, I wouldn't say it's 100% cost free. 

My main frustration with this all, speaking as someone who enjoys guns themselves and agrees that you should be able to defend yourself is how absurd the right side of the aisle can be with the ""self defense"" idea, and the argument that ""there's nothing to do, it just happens"". 

That argument would be laughed at if you said ""Sorry, guys. Terrorism sucks, but hey, people are going to be mad. What can you do?"". We're currently trying to build a giant wall, increase surveillance and restrict immigration from certain countries (regardless of our role in fucking up said country) and it's all a direct or near result of ""stopping terrorism"". If Washington pretended to even care half as much about something that's a far greater danger to US citizens domestically as it does the boogieman that is terrorism, things might actually change for the better. "
5062,7b4roi,Why doesn't defense spending count?  Is it not the taxpayers paying for weapons?  Personally I'd rather my taxes go to making people healthy rather than violence.  
5063,7b4roi,"Correction. There is no RIGHT to healthcare. 

Also, we are FORCED to have it even if we don't want it. Or pay a ""penalty"" for not having it even if you pay cash for your medical fees. 

FYI: cash rates are frequently much less than out of pocket WITH insurance. "
5064,7b4roi,The availability is an issue. When I want to buy a gun they won't ask me if my job will help pay for it. The government won't make me job keep me from working 40 hours a week so they get by the rules is having to pay for my insurance. A gun won't cost me a huge percentage more because I don't get it through my job. 
5065,7b4roi,"And you also got the nail on the head.

No one *has* to buy a gun. Participation in the market is voluntary. Prices are transparent and one can shop around for the best price, or choose not to buy a gun at all.

We all *have* to buy healthcare. Participation in that market is involuntary. Pricing is opaque and shopping around is nearly impossible in normal situations, and absolutely impossible in an emergency. Your choices are buy what they’re selling for the price they demand, or die.

So, yeah. It makes sense that we aren’t “forced” to pay for anyone else’s guns, but that we are “forced” to help pay for each others healthcare. 

I wonder how much gun injuries cost us in healthcare services each year.."
5066,7b4roi,People have the right to a gun they don't have the right to health care in the USA.  Stop & think about how messed up that is. 
5067,7b4roi,"Not everyone making this claim is lying. My premium for family of 5 was $1780 +or- $50 before ACA. Just received notice my premium for 2108 will be $3568, up from $2544 last year. I'd like to say it was the same plan for apples to apples continuity but my old plan was cancelled due to the ACA. In any case the my previous coverage and current coverage is about the same and the cost is almost double. Your 99% figure is a long ways off from my reality.  "
5068,7b4roi,"> Nevermind they had the votes to pass it on their own.

5069,7b4roi,You're right when I read last night nothing was announced 
5070,7b4roi,"I’m not sure exactly what happens I just know it’s illegal. The short time that I worked for a gun store I never thought to ask, but then again I never planned on selling a firearm without going through NICS so it never was an issue of what kind of trouble I would get in. I guess there could be multiple ways to be checked. You have to log every firearms into a book and then when you sell it you have to log it out with the same book and record the necessary info which includes a number from NICS (FBI) for that transaction. It’s been a few years since I worked in the store so I’m trying to remember this to the best of my ability. But the worst case scenario of checking is with an incident that happened this weekend.

I do want to point out that illegal sales like this a very very rare. The people who sell guns are pro guns, and it’s their livelyhood, they are not going to do anything that stupid to risk losing their FFL, and to give the gun industry a bad rep, just to sell one gun. I believe that a firearms dealer has a right to deny a sale of a gun to anyone if they feel the purchaser is not fit to handle a gun. With that in mind I hope people reading this who think we could use more gun control, I urge you to take the time to research the federal gun laws for sales thoroughly yourself through the govt. websites, not a second hand account from some blogger or reporter (I’m not trying to say anything about fake news here), and maybe go down to a rebutable firearms dealer and talk with them, I’m sure they will gladly explain to you the laws on firearms transactions. I think you will find that the gun control you may be looking for the govt to pass is really already in place."
5071,7b4roi,"The full consequences won't be decided after trial, and you cam find those sentencing ranges with Google.

As for how they figure the gun was sold illegally, this can be done with sales records and serial numbers.

The police look at the gun for the make, model and serial number. They will then go to the manufacturer to get the information on the FFL they sold to. They will trace this all the way to the final customer purchase from retail.

Now the cops check the sales records that the FFL selling the gun is required to maintain for 20 years on all transfers they facilitate.

This will get them the name of the buyer so they can contact that person and pull their background check.

If that customer is your bad guy, case closed, you know where they got the gun. Then it can be determined if the background check was done. All really simple up to this point.

If that customer has already sold the weapon or had it stolen things get a bit more complicated. The cops would then have to trace the path of the weapon and how it was transferred.

This system only works well with law abiding citizens. When the law is not being followed it gets tougher."
5072,7b4roi,"He would have never have passed the background check. Period. It doesn’t really change anything with what the dealer did. Selling the gun w/o a background check is just as illegal as selling a gun to someone who just failed a back ground check, and vice versa. 

I had to break the news to a guy that he failed the NCIS background check because of an incident 20 years prior. His felony was actually expunged but due to a clerical error it was never input into the system. It took him two weeks to fix it but he was eventually allowed to purchase his firearm. But it was flagged immediately when I read the FBI his ssn."
5073,7b4roi,Hopefully /u/squidzula cares about accuracy over hysteria and learns how instant background checks work. I have my doubts though. 
5074,7b4roi,"Only nine states require private party sales to include a NICS check. Unfortunately some of these states have shown that this is a stepping stone to overly restrictive gun control.

Example: Taking a new hunter out in California and need to borrow a gun from a friend to equip them for the hunt? The state requires a paper trail and NICS check on both the loan and return of the firearm. Even if the recipient of the gun is a roommate that already has easy access. I believe family members borrowing a firearm is okay only if it is not frequent (?!) or for excessive lengths of time.

My position - I would be okay with an informal NICS check for private sales, but it has been demonstrated to be a slippery slope and should not be implemented without careful consideration and very specific limitations. "
5075,7b4roi,"I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on military court martials, but its really unlikely that an Academy sports turned over a gun without a background check.  The repercussions are enormous."
5076,7b4roi,My point is making something illegal or hard to get doesn't work as proven by the drug war. The underlying issue needs to be addressed and that's culture and mental Health.

The excuse for the travel ban was that Muslim terrorists are coming here and blowing us up, when in fact millions of Muslims are not terrorists, and you're much more likely to be killed by a white non-Muslim, even taking into account population difference. Despite this, people still fear Muslims due to fear mongering. "

Not anti-government groups, which are extremely vocal and active.  That would be more taxes, more government involvement, and not supported.

Not to mention the fact that if it worked, that would demonstrate that the government was capable of doing something right. Another thing which cannot be tolerated if the goal is to maintain the view that the government needs to be eliminated.

Until the private sector find some way to make fixing gun violence profitable... Which I don't expect is possible... This is not going to change.  It can't be fixed by the government because a large segment of the government does not want the problem to be fixed by the government.  

This is simply the way things are now.  It sounds defeatist, but until one of the underlying symptoms is changed it's simply the reality of the situation.  Occasional mass shootings have been deemed the better option based on public support.  We don't say that, because it sounds terrible to say it, but we demonstrate it by our actions over and over.  "

So, if you're selling guns to people you have to be ok with the fact that your client is probably going to do something bad with it.

For example, a law defines a 'house' as a structure with 4 walls and a roof. Another law makes having a bonfire in a house illegal. The second law could have been written as making bonfires illegal in a structure with 4 walls and a roof.

Many many guns laws are poorly written because they often show a lack of technical knowledge about the subject matter. Instead of 'assualt weapon' it could have been referred to as a 'CA restricted device,' or 'CA controlled firearm' or something like that. Using 'assault weapon' is an attempt at manipulation, not leadership, and doesn't impact the underlying laws which use the 'assault weapon' definition. 

Anyway, plenty of CA gun laws makes sense when it comes to regulating the manner of sales, but actually criminalizing configurations or specific devices is asinine. It turns into something a kin to drug legislation where the manufactures make a slight modification and suddenly it's legal again.

Firearms are used far more often to frighten and intimidate others than for self-defense. Guns in the home are also used more often to intimidate or threaten other people living in the home than to defend the home against crime.  

Nearly all criminals that report ever being shot say they were shot by police or other criminals. Virtually no criminals report ever being shot by law-abiding citizens.

Firearm use by crime victims is also not shown to be any more effective at preventing injuries than any other protective action.

Uninsured, and under-insured people receiving care directly affect the cost of health insurance, and healthcare for everyone. A key tenant of the affordable care act - the universal mandate - was a direct attempt to curtail this problem. 

If the universal mandate is removed, then the only way to prevent or slow the increasing cost of health insurance and medical care in general is to either

Mix that with a lightweight social safety net and robust social infrastructure that values education and pride in working difficult jobs, and you're gonna have a society that has a lot less crime and poverty, period.


Gun violence is violence. It doesn't address the core issue of violence itself or why things take place. If you want to live a free society, you must admit that someone will always be able to do what this guy did or Las Vegas did.

That's freedom. What I'm more concerned about is the everyday gun violence that happens, over 85% of it is either suicide or drug related violence.


That tells me we have a serious issues with mental health (overprescriptions of SSRIs, bad AMA guidelines for mental health, issues with FDA and insurance, and healthcare providers just straight up not classifying mental health as important as physical health) and crime/poverty/drug law. That means our prison system doesn't work.

That means the jobs in our nation are not real jobs, but welfare subsidized jobs, and people wanting to 'make money', can do it easier and more profitable in the black market.

Particularly if that DGU is a truly good estimate of ""Preventative Gun Use"". What I mean is, most surveys conducted about DGU only account for the defenders perspective and if they felt like in an incident where a gun was pulled did that help to prevent harm. Many critics can state and have stated that most sample sizes were small and that bias may have been a factor. Or like someone below me has pointed out, perhaps from a more neutral perspective, the gun use by the defender wasn't for protection but rather escalated the situation themselves by producing a gun. 

This is a very complicated situation, and going back to OP, tragedies like this as more a result of overall lack of adequate mental health care options than lack of gun control, but both played a part here."

You need to come up with some. Republicans can rely on being 'status quo' with no ideas (that's the whole point of conservatism), but you need to actually come up with some ideas that work. Not the same ideas that don't work.

Also, that feeling when Denmark AND Sweden AND Norway AND Switzerland all have more market oriented solutions than your nation and your leftist party thinks they're bad.


Can you come up with ONE market based approach to a single solution in the US? Just one? I'm starting to think this is why you are unelectable. It's like you have this nation built on the literal tenants of capitalism, and you suddenly decided it was all bad because since 2000 the inequality has started.

So by 200 years of progress towards open capitalist markets ....and let's throw that away for a system of progressive authoritarianism the Swedes abandoned in 1993. All because of 20 years of bad regulation, both on the parts of each party. Doesn't matter who 'did it worse'.

The relevant law explicitly specifies conviction in **any** court.

No, we do **not** know that he bought the gun legally. Quite the contrary, we know that he bought the gun **illegally**. Specifically, he violated 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(6), and (9).  

Further, he perjured himself. Question 11c on form 4473 reads: ""Have you ever been convicted in any court of a felony, or any other crime the judge could have imprisioned you for more than one year, even if you received a shorter sentence including probation?""

The instructions for 11b define ""under dishonorable conditions"" to mean ""separation from the armed forces from a dishonorable discharge **or dismissal ajudged by a General Court Martial**"".

The questions themselves basically outline things that would turn up in a background check that would make you a prohibited person, and a couple extra that probably wouldn't: user of any drugs including marijuana, ever been committed to a mental institution, and currently under indictment.  Lying on the form itself is a felony, if the dealer themselves sells to you knowing that you have lied on the form will end their career and possibly carry fines/jail time.

5282,a5tyhd,There was a major problem around 2000 with illegal immigration into the USA by people illegally crossing the border rather than overstaying visas. At which point the border fencing was considerably improved and as a result there was a significant decrease in illegal crossings. Since then there has been a drop in the number of all types of illegal immigrants so it is no longer the major issue it was in 2000 and any additional border strengthening really doesn't do anything to stop illegal migration compared to the huge costs. There are far more cost effective methods of dealing with the declining problem of illegal migration than building a wall.

Yup. Sure is.  Pretty fucking creepy too.  And amazing that it's a bestselling novel despite that."
5355,a5tyhd,">I can assure you that the child gang bang isn’t the most messed up part of the book.

I've read how the movie had to make several large departures from the book, since they couldn't have the movie end with them literally tying their tongues with Pennywise and playing some sort of word game.  Honestly, just typing that last sentence makes me wonder once again what anyone ever saw in Stephen King's writing."
5356,a5tyhd,You do know that those are media clickbait ideas right? The same hyperbole that you criticize Trump about is exactly what they use to manipulate people to get clicks.

I'm glad you brought some substantive concerns to the fore in your reply to me. That's what you should have done originally.

That said, bringing up race and referring to society as a food chain makes me think you advocate violence."
5359,a5tyhd,"So what you're saying is that where we built borders, the borders worked. But it's a waste of money to build more borders. Because it won't be perfect. Right... 5 Billion dollars is just way too much money to spend on border security for our country, according to Democrats. Just don't pay too much attention to the south with all terribly run, violent, 3rd world countries with millions of people looking up hungrily at our border. It's not like they are forming up caravans with thousands of economic migrants looking to bumrush our borders or something! It's great cheap labor for corporations and political and hollywood elites, but it hurts the poorest Americans the most (ya know the people democrats claim to represent) when illegal immigrants take the jobs and lower the wages for low skilled work."

5369,a5tyhd,Have you read the book? The ending was WAY more metaphysical then you are making it seem. You are taking it way to literal. 
5370,a5tyhd,"King has a great way of soaking into the reader and making them accept insane things as believable. At least that's my experience.

That's also why so many of the film adaptations come out dumb."
5371,a5tyhd,"Meh.  I really enjoyed It.  It’s much more than a tongue twister, and they take a strong female character like Bev and reduce her to a damsel in distress in the movie.

Didn’t like it one bit "
5372,a5tyhd,"He has a way of capturing the ugly side of people that rings true and examines why they are what they are. For every IT, he has a Shawshank Redemption or Green Mile. 

King's an amazing writer in my opinion who writes authentic and interesting characters and subjects them to physical and moral hazards.

Occasionally there's an underage sewer orgy. I didn't like it either. "
5373,a5tyhd,I honestly don't even understand what you're trying to argue here.  Are you saying the Trump administration *hasn't* been separating children from their parents with no plan or ability to eventually reunite them?
5374,a5tyhd,You're blaming asphalt company's inability to hire workers on an entire generation of adults?..

Arguing for better treatment for all, regardless of income, is not out of touch."

Oh, if you only knew me.  I have no issues with smut.  I also have no issues with depictions of childhood sexual exploration, which is natural and can help kids process their experiences.  But there's a big fucking difference between, say, a Judy Blume novel and a child gang bang snuck into a horror novel.  It's a jarring juxtaposition, to say the least."

5410,7m7eqi,Let him take 365 a year as far as Im concerned.
5411,7m7eqi,"I mean, comparing a 24/7 365 day/per year job to the average American’s 40 hr/week 51 week/yr job is not exactly fair. Like, at all. Especially when you consider all the stress that comes with fucking everything up. 

Compare his vacation days to other presidents, not to average americans. It still compares unfavorably and its actually fair."
5412,7m7eqi,"I have always hated the vacation days comparison.  It is a flawed argument.  It always has been.  

These types of attacks would stick harder if they focused on the ethical implications and either the work not getting done or the issues with him vacationing at these places (the ""kitchen cabinet,"" BS security for classified materials, etc), or the hypocrisy of him being so critical of the amount of time Obama vacationed.  

People hear ""most people take 12 days but the President has taken..."" and they tune out.  The President isn't ""most people.""  His job isn't ""most jobs.""  Personally, I want my President to take vacations to help rest his/her mind.  Obviously, this is obscene but the argument distracts from that part of it.

This specific attack was used against Obama who did actually take more vacation than ""most people"" too.  But it was a bad attack because he was still productive and there wasn't the ethical issues.

So now the argument is, ""Most Americans take 12 vacation days.  Trump has taken 100.  Yeah, Obama took more than most people too but not as many Trump.""  "
5413,7m7eqi,"In fairness, most of us have hard jobs with important responsibilities. He's only the President of the Motherfucking United States, I mean honestly how critical is it for him to be at work most of the time?"
5414,7m7eqi,LOL! 15 paid vacations days my arse! I had 5 at my last job. Now I work for myself so I get none 
5415,7m7eqi,[deleted]
5416,7m7eqi,I only get 10 days a year.
5417,7m7eqi,"Eh... to be fair a President is never really ""off duty."" I'm in the same sort of situation... I've gotten shit for the amount of time I'm not in the office from some of the lower level employees, but what they don't see (and C level does) is me sitting in an airport for 6 hours working remotely. The highlight of my Christmas was taking advantage of the offices being closed so I could do server maintenance without interrupting work.

Time spent at a physical location (for Trump's role, at least) is irrelevant and complaining just makes liberals look whiny. There are so many damn things that you can criticize with his administration, why not target policy?"
5418,7m7eqi,Was it a vacation day when he was working? Careful what you wish for. 
5419,7m7eqi,"Doesn’t congress get like 4 months off every year? Hard to care about the president doing it when congress takes even more as the norm. 

We should pass a law that all elected politicians get the same number of vacation days as the average citizen. Same pay too. I bet republicans would change their tune pretty quick if they had to live like the rest of us. "
5420,7m7eqi,A man of the people. 
5421,7m7eqi,"b-b-but guys, he's working haaaaard for us, r-right?"
5422,7m7eqi,I wouldn't trust the wh to NOT be tapped after all that has happened.
5423,7m7eqi,What are these vacation days you speak of?
5424,7m7eqi,Real question: why don't people use all their vacation?
5425,7m7eqi,"Hate the guy, but this is misleading. Maybe he's been there for 100 days, but he goes on weekends that everyone else gets off too. Not going to fight untruth with deception."
5426,7m7eqi,"It’s really time for the Democratic Party to stop whining about what a piece of shit he is. We all know it. 

We should be making an action plan and plotting like the GOP did, not in a necessarily diabolical way but a game plan to get those fuckers out. "
5427,7m7eqi,Why does the average American not use all their vacation days? 
5428,7m7eqi,I hope he takes 200 vacation days next year! 
5429,7m7eqi,"But he’s going to make America great again.  We should be grateful that we even want to kiss his orange ass.  He could come out publicly tomorrow and announce that he fucked us all in the ass by wining he election and his whole plan was to really make the wealthy elite even wealthier and fuck the rest of us, he wins!  And all the trump supporters would respond...”wow isn’t he just the greatest president we’ve ever had :)”"
5430,7m7eqi,And it's not like he's busting his ass when he is actually working!
5431,7m7eqi,He ate some French fries and drank a milkshake. So there is that too. 
5432,7m7eqi,"It's very disheartening seeing this. Remember how Republicans gave Obama so much shit about taking time off? And Democrats did it to Bush before that? Let's not kid ourselves, being President is a 24/7 gig. Even when Trump is at his properties he is working.

Trump is a blithering idiot, and he spent a lot of time on Twitter complaining about Obama taking vacation time. Don't be like him. He's done enough stupid stuff that you can attack him based on things that have substance, not silly bullshit half-truths like this. "
5433,7m7eqi,"To be fair, three months at his properties? I come home to mine every day. I wouldn’t claim it a “vacation”. Otherwise would imply that the whitehouse is his and not ours as civilians. "
5434,7m7eqi,People don't work on vacation.  He's taken zero vacation days so far.  Why do Democrats lie about everything?
5435,7m7eqi,[removed]
5436,7m7eqi,well im sure the average americans number would be closer if you also counted weekends as vacation days...
5437,7m7eqi,"What on Earth are you on about? Do you not know how much was accomplished this year alone? And yet your still spreading these lies because you don't like the idea, the very concepts of a man dismantling the socialist agenda. Of course, I also realize I am speaking to an echo chamber of liberal hate and ignorance, so it's most likely you'll never listen. But you must be truly ignorant of the current government to believe any of this."
5438,7m7eqi,He can stay at his properties every day as long as he keeps making great policies and continues to Make America Great Again!!!
5439,7m7eqi,Can presidents not do their job from other places then the white house? I'm not a fan of Trump but I don't get why him being at Maro Largo means that he's on vacation and not doing anything. 
5440,7m7eqi,"Why not be upset about both? It was a huge point he used to rally his base, to criticize his predecessor about any time he spent not at the white house. Only to turn around and do the same 8 fold, and in the process profit? It is kind of a double fuck you to those paying for it. Really it's a bigger fuck you to those who voted for him, (the kind you get behind a Ralph's, you know you pay for it, it's really bad, stinks, and now you are suffering the consequences) thinking he'd be golfing less. Not more, while making money by doing it. "
5441,7m7eqi,"$91M on golf alone, at his own properties, no less. So we’re paying him to fly home and golf."
5442,7m7eqi,I’d also like to know how often he visited his own properties before he became president. I suspect he wasn’t there as often as he is now.
5443,7m7eqi,"The only people who can punish him are Republicans. 

Yepppppp."
5444,7m7eqi,They should be responding with pitchforks and demanding prison time and nationalization of his assets. He likes being a nationalist? Let the nation take his stuff
5445,7m7eqi,It's also amazing when you look back at how critical he was of Obama whenever he would leave the White House. 
5446,7m7eqi,"The article says a suit regarding his profiteering was dismissed last week. I haven't checked for more details though. But if it is the case, I suspect only Congress can do anything about it."
5447,7m7eqi,"What are you specifically suggesting? There’s not really much more they can do. They already forced an investigation into his potential crimes, and stated openly in congress that they are ready to impeach him immediately as soon as they have the votes. What more is there that has been left on the table? The Democrats aren’t just “concerned”, they are on a mission to destroy the Trump administration at all costs."
5448,7m7eqi,The real problem is he had made all of this seem normal in comparison with other crazy shit that had happened
5449,7m7eqi,Bravo!  This year long hissy fit does nothing but fool people in to believing they did something. 
5450,7m7eqi,"What are you calling for exactly?  You're outraged that people are outraged and aren't doing ""SOMETHING"" about it?  You're writing a reddit comment.  Good job."
5451,7m7eqi,[removed]
5452,7m7eqi,It's fake news. The president has not taken 100 vacation days. They count free weekends as vacation. He plays golf on the weekends. That's his sport of choice to stay sharp at over 70. Sport is important for mental health.
5453,7m7eqi,Did you have to work a full year before getting them?
5454,7m7eqi,Cue the actual thinking people who understand this isn't vacation time.  As a businessman D.J. Trump is accustomed to conducting actual productive meetings on golf courses.
5455,7m7eqi,We don't get much more mandatory vacation than them.  It should be at least 3 weeks plus stat holidays.  
5456,7m7eqi,Love Canada! Took my honeymoon at the Bnaff Hotel on it's 100 anniversery!
5457,7m7eqi,They also need to accept that the correct way to play football is with 3 downs.
5458,7m7eqi,Free healthcare and a government that cares about the wellbeing of their citizens or having 16c weather during December. I think I’ll stay in the USA.
5459,7m7eqi,I’d rather die than live under Trudeau 
5460,7m7eqi,"""All the stress"" can come with many other jobs so that doesn't justify anything."
5461,7m7eqi,If you can't handle the stress of being president... Wait for it.... *DONT BE FUCKING PRESIDENT*
5462,7m7eqi,I doubt Trump suffers from stress. You have to give a shit to suffer from stress.
5463,7m7eqi,"That’s right comrade, he’s working for **US**"
5464,7m7eqi,"Exactly. Getting every weekend off is already 104 vacation days for the president. That does not include all the other holidays. Not to mention he is always reachable by phone. 24/7. He will not be ""off work"" for 4 years. The average American working 40 hours a week M-F with every weekend off and vacation on top of that shouldn't be acting as if Trump has some super cush work hours. "
5465,7m7eqi,"Why do people START reddit comments with ""I mean..."""
5466,7m7eqi,Some of us 'member when Bush stopped playing golf when people told him it looked bad.  Just saying.
5467,7m7eqi,"Not to mention that half of those “vacation” days were spent working. He’s hosted several world leaders at his properties, and has had important meetings and functions there.

IMO, the argument should really be focused on all the money he is raking in by doing things this way. It’s a ton of profit, and a lot of it is at the taxpayers’ expense.

There is a real scandal here, but for some reason they’re going with “all presidents vacation, and Trump does it a little more, and so he’s lazy” or something. I say go for the jugular. He’s literally robbing the American people with these trips."
5468,7m7eqi,"No, the argument is far worse. They count weekends as vacation days. Trump plays golf on the weekends.   This is either stupid fake news to get clicks from stupid people, or an attempt by someone else to discredit the left."
5469,7m7eqi,Defending Trump is what makes Republicans sound stupid. 
5470,7m7eqi,"The fact that Trump constantly attacked the Obama administration should be front and center, right?  The fact that he works more than average people is one thing, but the amount of days he takes off in comparison to Obama should be discussed.  Right?"
5471,7m7eqi,"Yeah the problem is less that's he's not literally at the white house, but that he 

A) complained multiple times about Obama golfing and taking vacation despite the fact that Obama golfed less than Trump and spent more time at the WH

B) because Trump is staying at his own properties he is making money off of these trips and using these trips to promote his own brand 


I get that you can work remotely, but I also highly doubt that Trump is spending all of his time working while he's at Mar a Lagos both because of how many articles/photos I've seen of Trump golfing and how much he reportedly watches TV. "
5472,7m7eqi,This is a man who bitched incessantly about Obama golfing during his campaign. Then he proceeds to become President and golf even more. But you are right.  It is just one of many examples of the lying hypocrisy in his administration and there are many that could be areas of focus. 
5473,7m7eqi,And what about when Trump criticized Obama for the same thing?  Every time Obama went somewhere Trump sent out a Tweet and Fox News called foul.  Why aren't they doing that now?
5474,7m7eqi,"Not to mention this is counting weekends too, so by the same measure a person working Monday to Friday with 15 days holiday gets 119 days off a year. Which is more than the 108 trump has spent at Mar a largo.

There's is so much better to go after this fucking buffoon for. "
5475,7m7eqi,Like we should not trust you ya sick fucker.  Pay up for the dick pics we sent.  
5476,7m7eqi,It should be noted that he is charging his entourage to stay there and personally making money on it.
5477,7m7eqi,He can barely walk he is so out of shape and fat. 
5478,7m7eqi,"Tell me, what large piece of legislation has Trump passed this year?"
5479,7m7eqi,"Every time he stays at a private property HE owns, tax many is used to secure it. Guess who gets some if that money spent?"
5480,7m7eqi,I would suggest that he can keep making great policies and continue MAGA from the oval office. Or Camp David. 
5481,7m7eqi,"Then why go to a private resort? That will need to be paid for by the government. 

The government already maintains secure locations. Ie, Camp David. Why not go there? 

WIth so much bs and corruption occurring weekly, everybody has forgotten the story about the SS and golf cart rentals. 

That pisses me off by itself. What is flat out offensive that all those government reimbursement checks are going to DoTard himself."
5482,7m7eqi,"I defended Bush over vacation days, his ranch in Texas was sometimes used over holidays to help the staff due to the reduced needs for security and being out of DC.

I defended Obama over vacation days, Presidents can work from anywhere so location is not usually a concern.

I will defend Trump on vacation days because again, Presidents can work from anywhere.

I will not defend his funneling money into his pocket by playing golf and charging insane amounts to the Secret Service and such, this should be illegal."
5483,7m7eqi,"Because the less trump does, the better. All his actions lead to are failure and some sort of horrible thing happening, let’s just hope he doesn’t do anything to extreme and wait out these 3 years and a bit to come"
5484,7m7eqi,"I did not say I do not care about how many days he takes. I said that I care less about how many days he takes and more about how he is using it to funnel money to his properties. Even if he was taking an average amount of days compared to other presidents, I would still be concerned about it giving money to his properties."
5485,7m7eqi,"The money he is making is the disturbing and controversial part of this. The “vacation” time isn’t much different than other presidents. Especially since a lot of those days were working days, like when he hosted Xi Jingpin from China at his property for talks, or the Japanese prime minister, etc.

5486,7m7eqi,Not that I disagree with your sentiment friend but it is still a problem to criticize Trump for being a hypocrite. It's called the fallacy of tu quoque. Determining whether or not this issue is an ethical concern for the U.S. presidency should not be determined by the statements from Trump made previously that his actions do not affirm. All it tells us is Trump is either very good at understanding new perspectives or he just doesn't believe what he says. Either answer doesn't address the issue.

That seems to be a primary function of politics? Are you equally angry about Hillary Clinton's book sales? Although I will concede that there is a possible issue with him using his own properties, I have not personally looked into the issue nor read anything I would consider a reliable and impartial source for the implications. Personally, if I owned (and enjoyed) a resort, I'd probably stay there if I was a politician. 

>I get that you can work remotely, but I also highly doubt that Trump is spending all of his time working while he's at Mar a Lagos both because of how many articles/photos I've seen of Trump golfing and how much he reportedly watches TV.

So what? His role is not based on production. The Executive branch is not a factory and you can't treat it as such. I hold the same viewpoint for Obama's time outside the White House. For an Executive, it's all about policy. He's done some intentional good, he's done some accidental good, and he's done a fair amount of bad. I do think that a much larger share of the blame (and credit) needs to fall on Congress, and we as voters need to take a longer view of things done at that level."

It’s a mix of the two. Some of the issues have been exaggerated, and others are real but unenforceable right now. The republicans control the congress, and Trump is the president, so it’s not that easy to bring him down. They’ve tried to the point where anti-Trumpism has come to define the Democratic Party platform.

IMO video games would be worse, because a video game player has to concentrate on the play, but in golf the players have *lots* of time between a few seconds of play per hole, to talk about anything.

Campaign talk is definitely a thing, but he was throwing insults at Obama way before he decided to run.

Personally, if I owned (and enjoyed) a resort, I'd probably stay there if I was a politician. 

To a degree I agree with this. Most big name politicians *will* benefit off of their office through book deals, paid speeches, and so on. I don't expect a Trump to never make money off the office - every politician does including Trump's opponents Bernie, HRC, and all the republicans he ran against in the primary. However I think there is a big difference between publishing a book and making money off of the secret service staying in your hotel. If you write a book about your time in office, someone *chooses* to publish it and people *choose* to buy it. The secret service and all other government officials who travel with trump aren't making an active choice to stay at his hotels - Trump chooses to go to Mar a Lago and the SS *needs* to pay to stay there to protection and his staff *needs* to pay to stay there to provide support. There is also the added concern that people can essentially pay to have access to the president by buying a membership. 


Also, even if trump is equally productive at Mar a Lago, he is spending significant more of airfare and SS and Cost Guard protection costs by taking these trips. To me if feels disingenuous for a politician who is constantly talking about cutting national debt and cutting funding to Social Security and Medicaid to be spending 1.5 million a month on airfare - half a million more a month than Obama.

It makes me absolutely sick to see a man who is supposed to be our one leader demonizing half of his constituents because they don’t like how he has zero regard for the Constitution. When George 2 and Barry did shitty things, they at least sold it. Trump can’t sell. Any time he says anything remotely coherent about anything, he just can’t stop himself from going off-script and saying something ridiculous, untrue, or just fucking stupid.

Sure, which is why I said there was a possible conflict of interest. Is it a conflict of interest when the Secret Service pays for upgrades and additions to Obama's house or Bush's ranch as part of the lifetime protection?

Agreed."
5563,7m7eqi,"Which is why I accepted the possible conflict of interest.

The flip side is that the amount of money he gains from staying there simply isn't enough to justify it.

This time, however, it’s much more pronounced due to all the trump hate is hypermobilized relative to other past White House regimes. But whenever someone says something like “nobody wants him in office” I feel that it needs to be pointed out that the statement is incorrect. Were that to be true, he never would have been elected. Take a look at all the videos on YouTube since his election, compiling all the people that laughed him off and completely disregarding him as a candidate. One sticks out in my mind, Bill Meyers show had Ann Coulter on,  this was before trump even won the nomination. Coulter stated she believed Trump would be the nominee and everyone at the table laughed at her like she was retarded. 

That’s the kind of attitude that gets people like trump elected. That, plus a wrecked DNC putting forth the worst possible candidate to run against him.

5623,60fg8m,You're right. I think the issue is the frequency and the lying. Also the unnecessary expense to tax payers 
5624,60fg8m,"I agree. However, it's one thing to play on the secure course owned by the government (such as at camp David or a military base). It's entirely another to only play on the courses of your personal business interests which create a huge cost burden to secure.


It's the difference between a meeting and an advertisement."
5625,60fg8m,"Yeah, OK. That's why his administration tried to lie about where he was, right? Must've been some super secret business."
5626,60fg8m,"You do realize that most people have never played golf (other than the putt putt variety) and when they think of golf, they think of a leisure sports activity, not meetings. I completely understand if they're having a meeting while playing golf, but for most people, it feels like something only rich people get to do, so yeah, they make a snap judgement. "

5628,60fg8m,So you're completely fine with being lied to repeatedly? 
5629,60fg8m,Yeah but when you go on camera saying youd never have time for golf if you were president its a tiny bit hypocrytical. Especially considering how much shit he gave Obama for playing.

5633,60fg8m,See the photo of Pussy-grabber in the golf cart?  I doubt he does much walking.
5634,60fg8m,I don't think Trump walks.
5635,60fg8m,"well 2 things. First off, if you played golf you realize aside from putting and teeing off, there isn't much walking next to someone else and time between shots isn't that much. The main talking with golf is after golf when you are at the club house. 

Secondly, according to Trump you can't. Remember when he talked about Obama constantly golfing. Fox and the right wasn't trying to say that it was okay (even though bush jr said it was good). "
5636,60fg8m,[removed]
5637,60fg8m,[removed]

5640,60fg8m,[removed]

5642,60fg8m,"You might want to consider your alleged sources for your misinformation and do something about that, stat.

President Obama didn't hit the links until April, after being in office three months, and didn't lie to the public about it.  Trump has been golfing **TEN** times in his first eight weeks, so often he lies about it.  Do understand the sheer magnitude of the difference here?  Trump has spent about as much taxpayer money on vacations in his first month than President Obama did in a *year*.

Why aren't you outraged by this? 
"
5643,60fg8m,"If I remember correctly, he got plenty from republicans. Also, weren't those golf meetings with Boehner to help grease the wheels of congress?

5646,60fg8m,"Neither of the two people you responded to have stated, at any point, that they can't or didn't talk but made a (admittedly pretty lame) joke about him not walking much. 

"
5647,60fg8m,"Why wouldn't they just say that he was golfing then? They told the press he was unavailable because he was in meetings and on phone calls. I don't know about you, but if I told my boss I was busy in meetings and he found me on the golf course I'd be fired.  

Besides, the picture about him golfing is with a chef and a former Romney aide. What kind of important business is he discussing with them? "
5648,60fg8m,That wasn't my point but ok.
5649,60fg8m,"You just helped me realise something. Trump has golfed 10 times already, and so people defend him by saying Obama did it 11 times. That is so uncreative."

5655,60fg8m,"1. Are you saying that because Obama did it then it's ok for Trump to do it? 
2. Not sure, but I think the celebrity golf outings were during his vacations. Trying to google it but only found one article that goes into specifics"
5656,60fg8m,"I have no idea what you're on, to me it's pretty obvious that they're making a bad joke about Trump being out of shape and not much of a walking guy. 

I don't see how they have to reference your point about them talking to be ""valid"" comments instead of ""attempting to shift the conversation away"". Sometimes a bad joke is just a bad joke and not some 'subtle' way of controlling the discussion. "

5663,60fg8m,"Yes, these two guys responding to you are obviously subtle masterminds that attempt to control the conversation on this subreddit. It is impossible that they just wanted to make a bad joke without some sort of evil masterplan. 

A circle jerk is not controlling or shifting the discussion away it's just literally a circle jerk. And anything Trump related will be a circle jerk in both directions for a long time - dude is a polarising person that is relatively regularly stating very polarising things. 

Maybe you should take this less serious instead of replying with some passive aggressive ""sorry, it's obviously impossible to talk while driving"" stuff. Makes you seem petty too. "
5664,60fg8m,It's not an argument. Nobody is making an argument other than you. Not everything has to be a fucking debate. They're making fun of him for being fat - it's a low effort joke. It's not pushing a political agenda.

5678,7jgg41,"*Just vote.* That's really all there is to it. The entire conservative platform is based on building this false idea that there really aren't that many democrats, and that their votes don't matter, and that if they go to the polls they won't be able to vote anyway because of X or Y reason. *There were enough people voting democrat IN ALABAMA to win it.* Think about what that means for the rest of the country, where everyone except for the republicans has been convinced that they should stay home because their vote doesn't matter anyway. It's insane to think that people are so willing to consistently vote against their best interest for republican candidates and conservative policies. This election proved that, once the lies are dispelled, there are more than enough votes to make a difference."

With the NRSC pulling support, this race looks very different than any other GOP campaign for Senate would look. Trump’s endorsement does not come with with the institutionalized campaign networks, ground game, or fundraising that the traditional Party/NRSC support does. Had the traditional Party protocols stayed in place, I fear even in the case of Moore, a known pedophile and child molester, this outcome would have been entirely changed. "

5729,7jgg41,"For them, it’s values more than people. The WaPo was reporting that according to exit polls, an significant majority of Moore voters either thought the charges were spurious, or didn’t care. Also, almost all strict pro-life voters voted Moore. "

5734,7jgg41,"I wouldn't worry about it. I'm not jumping out of my chair to defend everyone who voted for Moore but belief in the allegations against him is strongly partisan. Meaning, most Republican votes don't think of him that way.

The decision basically makes a recount more cost-prohibitive, since they'll need to run all the paper ballots through the machines again.

> The court effectively told the state that it does not in fact have to preserve the digital ballot images - essentially digitized versions of the paper ballots voters fill out at the voting booth - created today.

> Though the state does not preserve the digital ballot images, it does maintain the original paper ballots. ""The records for federal elections are required by law to be preserved for 22 months after the election occurs,"" Merrill said.

5754,7jgg41,Update: He hasn’t. He is looking into doing a recount despite it being a >.5% loss to Jones. 
5755,7jgg41,"At this point, I think the GOP is cutting their losses and breathing a sigh of relief that they don't have to do an ethics investigation.

5798,7jgg41,The irony is that Alabama has voter ID laws. This literally couldn't happen. 
5799,7jgg41,"It doesn’t matter if there’s not proof that this happened, they’ll believe anything. They are in such a Fox News/Breitbart/infowars/Sputnik/RT bubble that they can’t understand that the tide is turning. "
5800,7jgg41,Alabamans really came through for America . We are all pretty embarrassed this even came up
5801,7jgg41,"When half the state votes for a pedophile, I think it's fair to say they represent America's low bar."
5802,7jgg41,No we dont
5803,7jgg41,"But the Supreme Court can release decisions contrary to their past decisions. This is PRECISELY why the Republicans blocked Obama's nominee (Merrick Garland) and pushed for the ultraconservative Gorsuch to replace Scalia.

If any of the liberal Supreme Court judges pass away (or retire) under Trump, you should fully expect Roe v. Wade to be reversed and for abortion to be made illegal in most of the US. "
5804,7jgg41,"That argument could be used against state gun control legislation, too. But states that oppose having a highly-armed population do as much as they can to limit it within the confines of the Constitution and the Supreme Court's interpretation of it. 



A state can't *ban* abortion, but they can add limitations and difficulties to make it much harder to get one. They can't prohibit, but they can legally oppose and obstruct."
5805,7jgg41,"To be fair, Jones is about as pro gun a democrat as you get"
5806,7jgg41,"Yup.  True story time:  Back in the late 60s my sister had a 12 year old classmate.  She was being raped by her dad.  She became pregnant, and disappeared from school, with little explanation why.  Her siblings were still in class, where did Becky go?  She had the baby, because, it is fine to force a small child to carry and birth a baby put in her by her dad.  Of course.  Becky was sent to a girl's home.  The baby was raised by its grandparents/dad.  He was dad and grand dad and the mom who could not protect her own daughter from being raped by him got to raise the baby.  

It is shit like this that makes abortion necessary.  "
5807,7jgg41,"Give him a few hours, we'll see if he feels the same like 4 am"
5808,7jgg41,Oh I would absolutely love if you guys could get out the vote down there to get it done. I have no doubt it can be as long as we get the turnout.
5809,7jgg41,"I think that perhaps the win in Alabama can show Texas Dems that it really can be done. Based on what I've seen from Alabamians, your vote mattering for once is a great motivator."
5810,7jgg41,You couldnt have interpreted what i said any more wrong.. They are both equally at fault and both are derived from sociallists and both are scum. 
5811,7jgg41,At least I saw some level headedness there. Some realize Moore was a fuck and they can even argue the candidate Luther Strange would of easily won
5812,7jgg41,This made me unreasonably happy.
5813,7jgg41,75% of white men still voted for Moore. You can keep being embarrassed. 
5814,7jgg41,"According the polling, 92% of Moore voters believe the accusations to be BS. Very few people voted for him *despite* believing the allegations to be true."
5815,7jgg41,"No argument there. I'm not defending them in the slightest, but they still represent a part of America, and I guarantee you that those percentages would be similar in any Bible Belt state, not just Alabama "
5816,7jgg41,"To be fair, it was not actually half the state voting, it was almost half of whatever percentage of the state voted.  "
5817,7jgg41,"Reversing Roe v. Wade would let states ban abortion. This could likely be reversed by federal law (the interstate commerce claude being so very broadly interpreted), so just pass a law about it. Failing that, you could get a Constitutional Amendment protecting it. 



And if you can't get either federal law or an Amendment about it, you probably didn't have sufficient support for it to protect it."
5818,7jgg41,You have to be to win in the south. I’ve often thought that if I were allowed to run in the south I would run on a pro gun platform even though I’m personally pretty against them. There are other glaring issues that need to be solved right now (like the rich/poor class war).
5819,7jgg41,"He's gotta wait to find out how he feels from Fox News. Once he's repeated all their talking points verbatim, we'll know the process is complete."
5820,7jgg41,"*Now* they do, yesterday those comments would have been deleted for dissent."
5821,7jgg41,"Most of the normal comments are already being removed in mass

Edit Just got banned for calling out a guy for being racist and a nazi. The mod literally called me a nazi because I pointed out if you hold a view that nazis are good don't expect any one to say your an amazing person "

5827,7jgg41,"I think, maybe, you've missed the point. "
5828,7jgg41,Sb3?
5829,7jgg41,"It reverses abortion laws and makes abortion illegal. 
Edit for anyone passing by: SB3 criminalizes abortion and punishes doctors for serving their patient's best interests and forces women to carry a pregnancy to term with no chance of survival. It even prohibits a woman's right to have an abortion in the case of rape or incest."
5830,7jgg41,Which would get to the Supreme Court and get bounced. Is there anything particularly new about this one that might pass muster when previous efforts failed?

Ok! So... you want take rich peoples money? Ok! Let's do it! Let's really do it... It cost about $4 trillion to fund the federal government for one year! Let's start January 1st!
 
12:01 AM, January 1 The only thing more evil than a rich person in the eyes of leftists is a rich corporation. Let’s take the two most evil of all: Exxon Mobil and Wal-Mart! Forget high taxes – let’s just take every penny of their combined 2010 global profits: $34 billion dollars! Now we’re talking! Spending all of their money gets us from midnight on January first to:
 
9:52 AM January 4 Okay, not as impressive as we hoped. So let’s now take EVERY SINGLE PENNY OF PROFIT from the other 498 fat cat companies on the Fortune 500 – ALL of it. That’s  $357 billion! That’ll get us to…
 
2:00 AM February 9 Okay, we’ve taken every dime of profit from the big companies, and it’s only Super bowl time. So let’s grab the obscene corporate advertising –  $250 million! — which will run the country for… 36 minutes. But why stop there? All the ad money on all 45 Super Bowls – that’s five billion dollars – gets us to:
 
2:00 PM February 9 Well, it’s obvious we can’t do this just on the backs of corporations. So if we’re going to soak the rich, lets start with the obscene sports salaries. Take all of the salaries from the NFL, NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball – not their endorsement deals, just their salaries – throw in all of the winnings on the PGA tour and redneck, knuckle-dragging NASCAR as well… That’s 9.4 billion, which gets us to…
 
1:00 PM February 10 Forget athletes… I mean, take all their money, but they’re not enough. Let’s get the rich! Let’s take 100% of every penny that anyone makes above $250,000. I can hardly wait. Let’s see:
 
A: Number of US households: 116,000,000?B:
 
Percent of households above $250k income: 1.93%
 
Number of households above $250k income: 2,238,800
 
Total income of households in excess of $250k = $1.412 trillion
 
Now we’re talking! Eat the Rich! Take everything everyone makes in America above 250k, which gets us from February 10 until…
 
6:00 PM July 2 Well, obviously we’re going to have to cut some spending. Let’s just stop paying for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – that’s where the money for health care goes, right? Into wars for oil? Not another dime; just bring ‘em all home. That would save us $105 billion Afghanistan and $159 billion in Iraq, a total of $264 billion – enough savings to cover us until…
 
4:00 AM July 29 Summer blockbuster season! Hey, we need the money, so screw you, Star Wars: take every penny in movies, toys, lunchboxes, etc — $25 billion – which gets us to…
 
4:00 PM August 1 Now God knows Hollywood has been good to the left, but they’re no longer useful idiots – they’re just idiots now. So, let’s evict everyone in Beverly Hills and sell their homes at current market value. 15,000 homes at $2 million per gets us another $30 billion, paying the bills through…
 
4:00 PM August 4 This isn’t working. Michael Moore assured us that there’s plenty of money. And that it’s all tied up in the rich. So liberal billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates – tough luck for you. $100 billion between them… they accidentally fall down the stairs at a public sector union rally, let’s say, and through inheritance tax we keep 50% of their loot — another $50 billion, enough to get us to…
 
4:00 PM August 9 All right. Let’s get serious: there are 398 more billionaires, according to the latest Forbes 400, with a combined total net worth of $1.29 trillion. A few hundred more accidents at 50% death tax – kill ‘em all and take their estate tax  — that’s another $650 billion. Good until…
 
4:00 PM October 13 Still not there. Okay, forget this namby-pamby 50% nonsense. Kill all the billionaires and take all of their money. Take everything from the next 100 or so of the almost-billionaires, and that buys us an additional 73 days until…
 
4:00 PM December 25 Christmas! Almost there! See how easy this is? Now remember, this is for America’s poor, so in the spirit of Christmas let’s get rid of foreign aid. This saves $50 billion – getting us to…
 
4:00 PM December 30 So near and yet so far: we’ve still got a day and change to pay for. To cover the remaining $12.5 billion we’re going to have to hit every American man, woman and child for $40 to pay for that final 32 hours. Which gets us to:
 
12:00 AM January 1, 2012. We did it.. Happy New Year, everybody! Now what? Who’s gonna hire you to work... people with all of the money who create jobs and give money to the federal government for their budget don’t have anymore money left! "
5856,8xqhk5,"Agreed.  Idealistic, but agreed!"
5857,8xqhk5,"why do white americans give away such tax breaks to the ultra rich, which they will pay for, and never be that rich?"
5858,8xqhk5,"Holy crap, is this a real thing? Can somebody provide a source to said Matryoshka yacht government subsidiaries?

All societies have an upper class system and redistribution of wealth is immoral and by law, illegal. That is not a solution. The current system is not infallible but it is the better than complete government control of assets, which is the only way her ideology pay for all she wants to do. This is why my democratic party of the 80's and 90's has failed because it no longer thinks in terms of substantial free markets that subsidized for the less fortunate. "
5866,8xqhk5,"Shouldn’t we be trying to portray a less radical agenda? I fear the anti-progressive conservatives are going to crush us again because we’re moving too far left. We need to be more subversive like Obama was when he was elected in 08’.

5874,8xqhk5,Socialism is the highest form of greed.

5881,8xqhk5,"No we can’t, because you’re just making shit up."
5882,8xqhk5,"Nope! Because if we give them more money, they won't buy more teensie tiny yachts to put inside the smaller yachts, they'll hire 1000 new employees at $20/hr in 10 new state-side plants! Won't that be great?"

5890,8xqhk5,"I have two main concerns about abolishing the Electoral College:

1. It requires a constitutional amendment, which means it requires buy-in from states that benefit from the current system. I’m all for long-term political projects but this seems more like tilting at windmills.
2. With a national popular vote, election officials in every state, not just swing states, will have an incentive to, ahem, tweak the vote totals. Even if your state is expected to go 70–30 for a certain presidential candidate, pushing that margin to 72–28 might be just the ticket to winning the popular vote nationwide."
5891,8xqhk5,"And the repeal of Citizens United, and the addition of SCOTUS nominees to drown out these conservative asshats trying to make like worse for average americans. "
5892,8xqhk5,I agree.
5893,8xqhk5,"I agree on the first 2. 

Electoral college, I'm not so sure. I'm in favor of getting rid of FPTP and moving towards a more parliamentary style government with better overall representation. 

edit: New York is #4 most populous behind California,Texas and Florida.

edit 2: A lot of interesting ideas. I appreciate the open, honest discussion. I'm always open for new and different ideas."
5894,8xqhk5,Does reproductive rights include abortion. Because I think a lot of people would take issue with taxpayer funded abortions 
5895,8xqhk5,"I mean most of that is included to some degree in most candidates platforms. Maybe not to the exact degree, and less on the electoral college change. 

But if trump and the fear of losing 30 years of progress isn't a motivation for you. I doubt this stuff would be. "
5896,8xqhk5,[deleted]
5897,8xqhk5,"The #1 thing that they must support if they want to continue winning elections - period - is comprehensive standardization of elections access.  IF we do not get this, we will stop winning elections no matter how many more votes we cast.  The EC only affects one election and isn't nearly as important, but still worth a look considering it seems that ONLY ONE PARTY seems to win on EC while losing on PV.

Everything else that can possibly be listed is trivial next to this.  Until we can expect the voting stations downtown to be as accessible as the voting stations uptown and until we can expect sane boundaries drawn and until we can expect not to be erased from voter rolls by the GOP (or foreign hackers), none of our other issues matter.  This is the #1 problem and has to be the #1 priority.  Other issues exist primarily to propel us into a place where we can address that one.

Level the field and the GOP will never win again until they start representing the majority."

In fact, this issue should have brought the country to the brink of civil war decades ago. The fact is the nation as a whole is rather comfortable with slow death. Only a military draft would cause that level of protest."
5905,8xqhk5,"Not American here, but the idea that your employer is responsible for your health insurance doesn't make any sense to me to begin with.  
Even less sense to allow him to make any decisions about what his faith allows him to pay for."
5906,8xqhk5,"Just my 2 cents, why would we trust a single payer healthcare system when the government can't prove they can efficiently run Healthcare. Look at the VA, you will find a small percentage of people who have good experiences but a large majority will tell you it's a nightmare. On top of the numerous scandals that consistently pop up in the news. People have literally died waiting 30-120 days just to get an appointment. "
5907,8xqhk5,Abolishes the electoral college that sounds like a bad idea why don't we just expand the size of Congress so that instead of rearranging seats every 10 years states would either lose or gain seats based on their population. Seats that are not needed are gone and new seats are created when needed instead of just shifting them around from state to state. The whole point of the electoral college is to keep elections from always beeing all about the large population centers
5908,8xqhk5,"College AND daycare. We need more babies.

The electoral college disenfranchises many minority party individuals (Republican, Democrat, or others) within States that do not get a say when their State goes all for one party or the other.

Is that a problem though? We're the United *States*. Our country is a federation of states. The office of the President was intended to have much less sway over individual states than it now does. Representing us to the world and foreign nations (as with North Korea and the G7 summit and other recent embarrassments), imposing tariffs unilaterally because of boogeyman economics, and going to war on foreign soil with no Congressional declaration or terms of victory (as in the Middle East right now) were never meant to be tools in the President's belt.

During the last election 50% of Ga votes went to Trump. 45% went to Clinton. Had Ga's votes been divided by the votes, Trump would have gotten 8 of Ga's 16 electoral college votes, and Clinton 7.

Of those three, the US is the ONLY country of those three who actually have a decent GDP/Capita, (China at ~8k USD, Brazil at ~8.6K USD)

And the funny thing? Only 15% of countries in the world have nationalized healthcare. 3/20. But in the top 10 it’s 14/20 (OCD kicked in so I made the bases the same) Using basic statistics, we get a Z score of 36.6. This means that, if it were truly unrelated, the odds of getting 70% when the true value is 15% is 36 standard deviations away. How ridiculously unlikely is that? Plugging it into a TI 84 doesn’t even give me a decimal, it gives me a straight up 0% likelihood.

I'd peel back military spending to 8 or 10% of our budget.  I'd take some of the savings and invest it in ports, inland ports, internet, highways, bridges, light rail, renewable energy.   Education grants, scholarships to both colleges and trade schools, tech funding and public-private technology partnerships.

Residents of large solid-color states get shafted even if the popular vote winner is sworn in."
6136,8xqhk5,"This is not a fluke.  It is an established pattern going back at least eight years.  Time and time again we are seeing more democrats voting and less democrats winning.  There are states where the GOP loses with 45-48&#37; of the votes and still wins 60-65&#37; of the elections.  That's mainly due to gerrymandering but it probably wouldn't be possible without the caging methods they use to delete minorities from voting rolls and then the strict requirements to regain the ability to vote, including irrational business hours in offices designated to provide the documents needed."
6137,8xqhk5,"Population needs to be the final say as every persons vote is the same as every other. If you prefer states, that state vote must be made on population totals. LA county has a larger population than 40 states, so California deserves more votes. The way it is now does not account for their size. 

I would also add that any city of that size is only that size due to people moving from other states. So still, All states could be represented. 

"
6138,8xqhk5,"I'm no expert, I could be way off base here. The way I see it is it's not necessarily a problem. Being a more Republican form of government has it's virtues. It keeps more remote regions invested in the federal government and less willing to secede/ignore the federal government or whatever problems may come up.

But we already have Congress to act as representative of the various peoples and regions. The Senate for States as a whole and the House for localities.

I also believe in one man one vote. And that an individual shouldn't have less say in how their government runs than another, which doesn't quite happen under the electoral college. Plus I think making the Presidency a strict popular vote would go a long way towards easing the partisan divide and make candidates less radical and Presidents less tied to their own party in terms of agenda. 

I think the electoral college has been gamed too often and in doing so has divided the parties ideologically and geographically in a way that the US has become practically two different countries within each other. I also think Congressional elections need to be reformed as well, partisan gerrymandering in particular needs to be addressed in order to make our representatives actually representative.

I wouldn't necessarily mind putting some checks on Presidential power. But it often seems like a Congressman's desire for such may hinge on the party the presidency currently belongs to. And with Congressmen often being poor representatives of their own States or butting heads in partisan and party faction disputes that can go on to shut down the government over relatively minor issues I don't often want them in charge of things either. 

I suppose prolonged neglect towards Congressional reform has led to an ease in relying on the Presidency for a host of responsibilities and powers it wasn't initially intended to have.

Just a few of my thoughts."
6139,8xqhk5,"I'm all in favor of ranked choice voting, but if that doesn't take hold then this is the best option to do the one thing needed: increase voter turnout. I guarantee California Republicans and Alabama democrats would show up more of they felt their votes actually would determine their candidates chances of winning. Ohio, my state, is a swing state because it really comes down to turnout who wins here. Pennsylvania/Michigan/Wisconsin are all the same. If you segment electoral votes based on % of total vote won, you've got a better representation of the voters views and as such will see an increase in turnout because every vote would count at that point"
6140,8xqhk5,That just sounds like proportional representation with extra steps.
6141,8xqhk5,"Or a simple repeal of the Electoral College would do the exact same thing. In your example, Trump would retain the votes in Georgia and so would Clinton. A ""proportional"" change to the Electoral College isn't needed to achieve this goal.

The best aspect of changing the Electoral College would be the required vote for a new Constitutional Amendment. This allows the people to decide."
6142,8xqhk5,"I think they just call a new election and kick the guy in last place.  Pairing this with ranked choice would eliminate most of the chance for it to fail.  If it actually reaches a crisis point where two candidates are left and the popular vote winner doesn't meet the same criteria I'd say just take them regardless at that point.

Ranked choice is the system, the quarter by three system is a caveat, and frankly were in a *MUUUUUUUUUCH* more stable geopolitical situation than Nigeria and although there'd be some partisan grumbling without a doubt, awarding to the popular vote winner at that point has already come after however many rounds of trying to find the candidate that appeases them, and we have an entire month out of highschool US history dedicated to what happened after a few states got too pissy about the results of a presidential election.  

If a few cities can outvote all the rest of the states, that's more an issue with those states not being attractive places to live for citizens, and not an excuse to deny the most popular (or in ranked choice, possibly the most acceptable) candidate from being elected by a majority of the voting public it's a sign that they have to change how they do business and try to attract new residents."

6166,8xqhk5,">Trickle-down economics, also referred to as trickle-down theory, is an economic theory that advocates reducing taxes on businesses and the wealthy in society as a means to stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term. It is a form of laissez-faire capitalism in general and more specifically supply-side economics. Whereas general supply-side theory favors lowering taxes overall, trickle-down theory more specifically targets taxes on the upper end of the economic spectrum

Here's a basic definition of trickle down theory, because it appears you either don't understand what trickle down economics are or are intentionally hamfistedly misrepresenting them.

Trickle down is not about ""taking less from people,"" this is a real misrepresentation, it is about eliminating progressive taxes that impact the wealthy, therefore starving public services in favor of larger tax breaks. 

It makes sense to take businesses and the wealthy more than lower-earning individuals. This is the difference between a progressive tax (aimed toward those who can afford it; see property taxes) vs. a regressive tax (aimed toward everyone without discrimination; see sales taxes). Especially considering the extra strain that wealthy people and their businesses put on government funded services (see McDonald's recommending employers sign up for government assistance, or how much wear and tear transportation services cause on our roadways compared to regular cars, see Koch Industries record of environmental pollution that others need to come clean), it makes sense for them to pony up more for the government in order for their contribution to society to be equivalent to what they are taking.

>The less that is taken the more that can he transacted.

Transacted... or, you know, [held in offshore accounts](http://www.businessinsider.com/wealthy-money-offshore-makes-inequality-look-even-worse), at least in part leading to the [worst inequality since the Great Depression](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/).

Teddy Roosevelt put it best:

I am not saying that a national healthcare system is a bad thing, just that no country has figured out to make it work correctly yet. 

The closest I have found that works decently is in Hawaii (where I currently reside). Anyone who works full time in Hawaii gets healthcare from their employer.

The eventual turn of socailist from socio-capitalism is the taking of property and goods by force. Henece my reference to 1920 Ukraine. Those Scandinavian countries socialist love to quote have a little problem. Allow me to list...
1. The Nordic system kills inovation and the USA adopting their policies would have a direct impact on the world econoy and invovation. 

2. The low income inequality in Nordic countries was not a cause of their implementation of the welfare state. They had low income inequality, low poverty levels and high economic growth also predated the welfare state. After implementation, you saw a significantly slower growth rate and higher taxes to pay for the welfare state. 

3. Socialism killed small business and startups. Back to point #1. Out of the 50 largest companies in Sweden, only 1 has been post 1970 when the welfare state started to reach far and wide throughout the country.

4. The like of diversity in Nordic countries makes it easier to adopt socialist ideals. Not so easy in the most diverse country in the world.

5. If the government is to take on a bigger and more powerful role in redistributing wealth, citizens first must be willing to put their faith in the government. But in the United States, public trust is historically low 

So with all that being said, introducing any form of socialism into the USA would not only be immoral but self destructive. Destructive in the manner that took place in the Ukraine where farmers crops we're taken without reimbursement and distributed as the government saw fit while the farmers themselves were killed or starved due to the lack of food. I don't see that going well anywhere in the USA. Simply put socialism is evil by design and one of the biggest mass murderers in history under the disguise of morality, pity, fairness"

You are right . In USA  there is the apathy of the individual who don’t seek change in is relative comfort.
And there is the genuine ignorance of the voters who did not know the name of their reps and their plateforme. They vote for them as long as they have the good party name in the box.

The issue is this country is becoming increasingly less purple and that's honestly disastrous. "

Second edit - seriously it is only with ideological or wealthy elite blinkers on that you can not see national healthcare as clearly superior to a privatised system.

The pigshit pushers local government  has no control over farm policy, that's been entirely  federal since FDR. 

If I recall correctly,a scotus appointment  did require a super majority until the Senate changed that to block a conservative appointee. I may not have that exactly right but that's my recollection.

You're making a pedantic point. A national provider system, now considered an anachronism, is still technically a single-payer system.

Assuming you have insurance, even through your job (which for some reason gets treated like a different kind of insurance for some asinine reason... It's the same shit and you do pay for it in part). You're already paying premiums that go into a pool of money that the insurance company uses to pay out other people insured who are getting abortions. So whether it's the gubmint (single payer) or blue cross, does it really matter? "

We don't pay itemized tax bills according to what we support, we pay according to our income and then we elect officials to spend it how we want them to. Surely you prefer .00003¢ of your annual tax dollars going to abortions for low income women than those women being forced to have children they can't support and paying substantially more for her food stamps, Medicaid, housing stipend, TANF, etc."

The Climate Citizen Lobby supports a system where such a tax would be paid to every citizen as a dividend for compensation of damages from GHGs. So basically you get a check every month because certain prices will become higher, but if you buy less pollution causing goods/services you'll make money on it.

Now, the farmers deserve local rule.  That's my opinion.  But ask them if they'd accept it and I'll bet you they'll say NO.  Because money overrides the need for in-touch rulers.

Of course it hurts you, but then, if a street thug is stopped from mugging someone to pay his rent, that does hurt him. But it doesn't justify letting the mugging take place.

Leave alone the flaws of public education (which is a different discussion), but who are you to judge that someone's money is better spent on it than a yacht? That is literally the money they legitimately accrued, they are morally the ultimate decider of how it should be spent.

The yacht buyers literally should be answering to no one as long as their funds are legitimately accrued. If you don't like that they buy a yacht with it, I'm sorry, but tough. Someone may not like that you buy a certain brand of toothpaste. Does that mean they should be able to punish you for it?"

Personally I think the concept that corporations want to raise wages is an absolute crock of shit when they can retain all that extra money and increase earnings but that is how they think. If we really want to boost the middle class cut their tax rates even more, keep all current provisions that benefit them and create more high income brackets and tax them even more. I don’t mind the corporate cut but the self proclaimed deficit hawks basically putting themselves in a Scots tots scenario with how they’re funding the cuts is asinine."
6292,7gqgrb,"This honestly seems like grandstanding. I can't think of any reason the government should intervene into exactly how a company conducts business besides ""people should be payed more money"". That's a wage/price control and we should be very careful about imposing them, more so than ""just because""."

6305,7gqgrb,"god forbid you actually give the people that make your business work every day decent wages. this country fucking sucks and i don't think America was ever ""great""."
6306,7gqgrb,"How so?  If the corporate tax rate is reduced by say 10% which frees up $250,000 the owner can choose how to use the added revenue by investing it in the company, adding benefits, keeping it, giving raises or hiring new employees.  By bringing on new employees there would not be enough money to give raises (therefore it would not effectively do the same thing).  It would however bring more people out of unemployment or underemployment.

The question remains, which is better for society: giving raises or bringing on new employees?"
6307,7gqgrb,"I work as an executive in a large corporation. No way we are going to invest more  money in people. We already get the job done with the pay now.  

We will invest in more profitable outlets in which we will hire more people but they’re going to get payed slightly less than those who are employed now so we can manage their increase in wages over the next 6 years. Then they either top out and advance or stay at a 3% increase a year for their remaining time. 

I’ll make more money  in  salary negotiation as well as bonuses due to new outlets.

6393,7gqgrb,"The amendment just applies to the use of tax savings to increase executive pay, stock buybacks, and dividends to shareholders, which are three of the scummiest ways to spend extra money. Employee pay would have to rise proportionally to executives.

You can have 100% employment (slavery, communism, etc) and no economic growth.  Employment doesn't drive the economy as much as wages unless there's severe unemployment.

The impact of raising all wages a little is greater than adding a small percentage of jobs at the lower wage rate."

Take the pool of American citizen employees with qualifying health insurance who are paid a full year at or below 25x the poverty level where they live, add all of their salaries together, then take the growth of that pool year over year and make it a write-off on corporate taxes.  You would have to subtract last year's salaries of employees who got enough of a pay raise to get out of the pool, and make a caveat that it only applies to companies for which last year's pool is non-zero.

In Italy, they pay their employees much more and give all employees a month of paid vacation a year. The CEO's don't pay themselves anywhere near the amount they do here. As a result, the employees are all much happier all around and work harder because of it. Which in the end leads to a more productive work force and more profit for the company."

Logical: People should be paid based on the value they produce. Since the '70s CEO pay has grown by ~1,000% while worker salaries have risen ~11%. Have CEOs grown in value-add by 100x the average worker since then? If no, their pay should not have increased at 100x the rate.

Economic: Resources should be allocated to where they will generate the most utility. Does each marginal dollar in compensation create more utility for a CEO who already has a multi-million dollar pay check, or dispersed among many workers that make significantly less?

Except corporations are ran by people. If they know they are gonna get tax cuts they move that money from costs of running and therefor increase their stock value. Causing growth in the company and growth within the economy. For example the S&P 500 index increases now. Market trends show unemployment therefore decrease when there is economic growth. Because corps are more willing to hire more.

It’s not so much trickle down economics .

Imagine. If you are trying to buy a tv for $500 and you wanted a ps4 for $200. You only have $500 so you have to decide which do you want more. Well clearly you need a tv to play your ps4 so you have to buy that. but then I told you that on cyber Monday that same tv will cost $300. You as a person would think “great now I have an extra $200.” You would consider that $200 as liquidity. Now you can save it or you can get that ps4.

People tend to think of corporations as entities but forget they are ran by people. It’s really difficult to fully rely on quant analytics of the company to see if you are gunna make a lot of money. Buffet knows that it’s important to have the right people running the company. So you can’t remove the people element. But acting like tax cuts don’t improve the economy you are neglecting that people being told they are gunna save money isn’t going to cause a psychological effect. 

Source look at market trends now and unemployment rate. Look at market trends and employment rates when companies are told that they won’t get that good of a tax cut.

If you need further proof. Companies include big brother fed in there assets because they know if they are too big to fail. The fed will come in and save their asses.

> UPDATE: Democrats just offered an amendment to ensure corporations use their tax savings to raise employee wages at the same rate they increase executive pay, stock buybacks and dividends to shareholders. Every single Republican voting, voted NO. #GOPTaxPlan

""Increas[ing] executive pay, stock buybacks, and dividends to shareholders"" are all ways to line executives' pockets.  Obviously directly increasing their pay does this.  In addition, buybacks and dividends are financial tools to raise the price of company stock, and most executives at large corporations make a significant amount of their compensation in the form of stock options.  This amendment says that if executives want to line their own pockets with tax breaks, they at least have to increase employee compensation at the same rate.  If they want to invest in new equipment, fine.  If they want to pay down debt, fine.  If they want to keep cash on hand for financial reasons, fine.  But they can't simply cut the CEO a huge check without giving their employees a bump, too.  

If Republicans truly believe tax cuts for corporations will lead to higher wages, what's the problem here?  How is this dumb policy?  If these tax cuts were going to produce higher wages anyways, what exactly would this amendment force corporations to do that they weren't going to do already?  "
6529,7gqgrb,"> dictating the amount of money C.E.O's are allowed to make

That's not what this amendment suggests.  This amendment would restrict how much of a *tax cut* could be used to raise CEO pay, and the only restriction is ""you have to raise employee wages at a commensurate rate.""  CEOs can raise their pay as high as they want using the money from these tax cuts as long as they raise employee wages, too. 

> Allowing the government to set a maximum wage 

This amendment does no such thing.  

If Republicans really believed in the free market, they'd agree to this amendment on the condition of Democratic support for their tax plan and get the thing passed.  Good CEOs could think of a dozen ways to use tax breaks to create actual grown in their companies, which would in turn raise the value of their stock options.  Bad CEOs -- who just want a bigger paycheck without creating real world value -- wouldn't be able to just funnel the additional money into their pockets.  How much more free market could you get?

Walmart will fire all cashiers, janitors and stock workers. Instead they will hire janitors from a local cleaning company. Stock workers from another.

There are 1000 laidoff minimum wage earners waiting for your seat. 

Alternatively they'll run the McDonald models and franchise the stores. The owner of one store isn't likely to break a million a year, so they can hire $20k people easily.

They can also hire 'consulting' companies who would run the store ""on their behalf"". Since the new company is responsible for hiring and paying workers, the limit is tied to their CEO, not Walmart's.

6624,7gqgrb,"Isn’t it fair to lock the minimum wage at a specific purchasing power? This way if inflation increases or decreases the minimum wage will still be worth the same amount, so neither companies or workers are being screwed?"

6642,7gqgrb,"Hell yeah I do. Why shouldn't we? You really want to let the way things were 200 years ago dictate the way things will always be without being able to change with the times? The Constitution is able to be amended for a reason. 

It is estimated that by 2040, 70% of Americans will live in 30% of the states, meaning the remaining 30% of Americans will have 70% of the representation in the Senate and in the Presidential electoral college. The 70% of Americans having more representation in the House (which isn't wholly accurate anyway because of gerrymandering) isn't sufficient IMO. 

While I support each state being its own entity for state laws, I believe that when it comes to the presidential election it should be one person, one vote, and that there shouldn't be an electoral college that divides the votes up by state and provides electoral votes per state such as we have now. States are their own entities for having state laws, but they are not their own entities when it comes to the idea that ""we the people of the state of __ have reached a consensus on who we want as president.""

6649,7gqgrb,"The market doesn't control greed, what it controls is prices. The price of labor is set by the supply and demand for labor. If the market is healthy and a company is paying too little for labor, then someone else will pay more for the labor. Then the price of an individual's labor will trend towards it's natural market price, or what companies are willing to pay for it. That's what a market is.

Sometimes the market fails, and in those cases, with proper research, we can use government intervention to smooth over market failures. Such as what we do with the minimum wage. What we can't do, is pass laws that mandate salary increase policies for every job in existence in the united states. To do that, you'll have to explain why the market is failing, what the effects of intervention are, and what the costs of inaction are. ""I hate business!"" is not proper policy, and I suspect if you propose it to a panel of economists, you will be met with unamused looks and a flurry of watch-checking."
6650,7gqgrb,"I wasn't talking about salary vs hourly wages, I'm actually not familiar with how the minimum wage works with salaried workers, and I agree with you that salaried workers should make at least minimum wage for their time.

The discussion isn't about minimum wage but rather about pegging salary increases to the ceo. That's a policy that I think is unnecessarily draconian and doesn't make sense. Unless there's an empirical need and reasonable method for government intervention then we shouldn't do it.

""I'm not getting paid enough to live"" is something that we as a society have agreed is a market failure that needs intervention. ""I have enough to live but I want to be paid more"", which is what we're discussing, is not something that we as a society has decided is a market failure that requires intervention, and certainly not something we handle with nonsensical policies like this one.

"
6659,7gqgrb,"/u/dschurman says it better, but if a party is gerrymandering state elections, they are also most likely engaged in voter suppression tactics. For example, overly restrictive voter ID laws, reductions in campaign finance regulations, not funding vote monitoring measures, etc.

These efforts are designed to help the vocal minority across all electoral boundaries.

So to answer your question, while gerrymandering state districts shouldn't have a direct effect on a popular vote like a Federal Senator, there are more likely other measures at play being ennacted by the vocal minority that would have a direct effect on a popular vote.

How are you going to vote for your Senator if polling lines are hours long because your party reduced the number of polling stations in your state?"
6660,7gqgrb,How far do people research their vote?
6661,7gqgrb,"Here's a decent answer from my quick google search:

""While the state-wide nature of gerrymandering would make one think that it has no effect, it certainly could.

Elections are run at the state level, so a state-gerrymandered election could alter that balance of power in the state legislature, which would effect things like voter-suppression measures, enactment and enforcement of campaign finance regulations, and the ability of elections to be monitored and for rules to be enforced by non-partisan (or partisan) entities.

In Wisconsin, this was, in part, the basis of their gerrymandering case/challenge that will now be heard by the Supreme Court. In 2012, Democratic candidates got the majority of State Assembly votes, but the GOP won a huge majority in that lawmaking body. The GOP enacted voter ID and other restrictive measures, that have been struck down, then reinstated, by different levels of the courts.

It would be difficult to claim this did not have an impact on state-wide results. Those in power (regardless of party) tend to favor policies and practices that perpetuate their power."""
6662,7gqgrb,Everything
6663,7gqgrb,"There is CURRENTLY no effective way to gerrymander to directly benefit a US Senator.

This is why these GOP fuckers want to repeal the 17th Amendment and go back to appointment by state legislatures. Because then they extend the gerrymandering all the way into the US Senate.

It's a naked power play, and it can be stopped, but we have to pay special attention to local elections. VOTING IS KEY! It's especially important in local elections because a lot of this stuff is formed at the local level and it cascades upwards. Virginia voters did a lot of good last month; NJ too! We need to keep up the pressure."
6664,7gqgrb,"I think you're correct that the term Gerrymandering applies to the House and not so much to the Senate. However, the same ""vocal voting minority"" having outsized power in the senate argument holds true. Wyoming gets the same amount of say in a Senate vote as California or New York, and that's just nuts. CA has 67 times the number of people that Wyoming does, but somehow has the same electoral pull. Are the people of Wyoming 69 times more important or something?"
6665,7gqgrb,"~~An entire state doesn't vote for all the senators.  Each senator is representative of a block of voters.~~ (edit: yes they do)  Gerrymandering breaks these districts up with ""creative"" line drawing to isolate voters and insure they are a minority in each voting block.

6666,7gqgrb,"It's not, that why we have a bicameral Congress. Would you be okay with a minority being completely powerless against a majority?"

It's a profit game short and simple and workers will not get what they need. The market is absolutely manipulated by it's biggest stakeholders. You're arguing with be with economic theory that's been rammed down or throats for 200 years and it's hardly worked out for the person at the bottom. It's in businesses best interest to pay workers as little as they can."

Being an ass is unpersuasive.  "
6678,7gqgrb,"The problem with that though is that ""the people"" will always want something different than businesses. They're two polar opposites at this point. Most major companies don't put the welfare of their employees ahead of their bottom line. The people are much more likely to agree to a middle ground and have very little power to push continual change further. Whereas corporations have large pools of money to waste on lobbying their interests. Which is sad because if they spent half as much on lobbying as they currently do, they would be able to pay their employees more and we wouldn't likely be having this conversation."
6679,7gqgrb,"Another example of growth and investment is to enter a new market segment or create a new product or service.

Increasing wages is not the only way to grow an economy. Its a good way, sure, i agree that the middle class making more and spending more does lead to economic growth. But its not the only way. New capitalist ventures need investment, other businesses need customers (which include large corporations) etc etc. The list of things that grow and invest in the economy is actually endless "

6681,7gqgrb,"Ugh fine, I suppose that's a valid point.  Don't get me wrong, I definitely agree that voter suppression is a **huge** factor in the current political landscape.  While what you said is certainly right in pointing out how gerrymandering contributes as a root cause of the voter suppression, the extra degree of separation makes calling the senate 'gerrymandered' seem like it's not quite the right way of describing it.  Either way, good on you."
6682,7gqgrb,"Do you have a source on the 17th Amendment thing? I'm sure they would love to try it, but this is the first I'm hearing of it being suggested as anything even resembling a real possibility. "

6684,7gqgrb,[deleted]
6685,7gqgrb,I'd rather that than what we have now: the majority powerless against a minority so entrenched via this system and gerrymandering that they can't be gotten rid of

I have DEFINITELY had Trump supporter co-workers in a very corporate, professional environment. But, then again, I live in Texas. "
6688,7gqgrb,"Because concentration of wealth at the top leads to instability, but also is really unjust. People don't really grasp how insanely rich these people are, and why someone like the Koch brothers or the Mercers or the Waltons, with billions more than they could ever hope to spend, are allowed to sit on vast fortunes while American infrastructure is falling to pieces, people starve, and people die from preventable diseases because health care is out of their reach.

It's that people having that just massive level of resources while huge amounts live in poverty or precarious lives one step away with an eroding safety net is an unjust way to organize a society. 

The concentration of wealth in this country has surpassed the Gilded Age. People regularly work several jobs to stay afloat, and full-time + benefit jobs are shrinking. Most of the jobs created from 2009-now have been part time, and while unemployment is low it's not the only measure.

It comes down to how you view the world- should more Americans go hungry and die young so Steve Mnuchin can buy another yacht? "
6689,7gqgrb,You’re proving mine!
6690,7gqgrb,Yeah I think that makes sense.
6691,7gqgrb,"Regional matters would be handled at the local level, if there's an empirical case for government regulation at the local level then there is, if there isn't then there isn't.

If there's a single employer then I think this is not a healthy market and I think most discussions of healthy markets don't apply."
6692,7gqgrb,"Right, it's in businesses best interest to pay workers a little as they can. So they will, until someone else starts paying more. Then if the company still wants workers, it needs to pay that higher price. When the company decides it's better not hiring anyone, then we've found the true price that the company is willing to pay. You're slowly getting supply and demand.

These are the same forces that reveal the price of eggs and the price of milk. People want to pay as little as they can for milk, but the price of milk is not $0, it's at the price which is revealed by the market. If someone decided that his price ceiling for eggs is one cent, everyone else will continue buying eggs at the market rate. We used to legislate the price of things like milk and eggs, and we know now not to do that.

You would need a very strong case for such a price control and all you're doing is saying corporations are greedy. That's not a case and it's no basis for writing policy."
6693,7gqgrb,"Great! You found one instance over 80 years which isn't really what we're talking about but is a narrower and targeted government intervention, which I've already indicated that I'm open to. I think this proves my point, which is that the policy under discussion is unusual, which lends to the wider point that this is irresponsible policy."
6694,7gqgrb,"**Trickle-down economics**

Trickle-down economics, also referred to as trickle-down theory, is an economic theory that advocates reducing taxes on businesses and the wealthy in society as a means to stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term. It is a form of laissez-faire capitalism in general and more specifically supply-side economics. Whereas general supply-side theory favors lowering taxes overall, trickle-down theory more specifically targets taxes on the upper end of the economic spectrum.

The term trickle-down originated as a joke by humorist Will Rogers and today is often used to criticize economic policies which favor the wealthy or privileged, while being framed as good for the average citizen.

6695,7gqgrb,"you are correct, but i think that is a bit naive. the people making these decisions have no interest in boosting the economy, they only care about making more money for themselves. regulations on how some money is spent keeps degenerate practices such as the housing crisis not happen as often.

we can definitely have laws about how SOME money can be spent. that definitely doesn't mean that suddenly the government will mandate where every penny will go."

IDK how ""real"" it is in a practical sense, but it's totally fucking real in the headspace of the current right-wing nutjob conspiracy circles. If these fuckfaces can get their Constitutional Convention together, this one is probably the most likely to pass.

6697,7gqgrb,"I looked it up, you're right, I'm wrong.  Edited to correct that.

The fact that often, both aren't voted on at the same time threw me off."
6698,7gqgrb,"The majority of people don't vote, and gerrymandering/racist barriers to voting do not account for the sheer number of eligible voters who don't vote. I would argue that the nature of Congress itself isn't the cause of the problem you are describing."
6699,7gqgrb,"Ok, but increasing taxes on the rich isnt going to solve or even make a tiny dent in income inequality. Youre going to have to give me a better reason

Check out this brooking Institute (a sort of left leaning institution) study on that question, skip the cnn editorializing and read the study

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/money/2015/10/13/news/economy/taxing-the-rich-will-not-curb-inequality/index.html

Taxes are not meant to solve income inequality. Youre never going to be able to tax the rich enough unless you start taxing their wealth

To answer your last question, no, i think Steve Mnuchin buying a yacht has nothing to do with Americans going hungry and die young. Theyre not related phenomena. Wealth is not a zero sum game. The poor are not poor because other people are rich

The fact is weve been fighting the war on poverty for decades with more and more government services and handouts, and it hasnt worked. More entitlements is not how you address poverty. It does do a fine job of skyrocketing the cost of living though"
6700,7gqgrb,"It's not though because our market isn't free, it is manipulated heavily by big business. Price fixing, subsidies and wage manipulation are things that are very real. Yes in a perfect world the market would adjust, but we are far from that."

6702,7gqgrb,"Well thats the really cool thing about capitalism in general. The economy is driven entirely by self interest, it doesnt matter if they care about growing the economy, they dont have to. They will care about growing their market share, their profits etc. Its hard to reach those goals without helping to grow the economy whether thats on purpose or not

But hey thanks for being civil, just trying to present a different viewpoint thats all"
6703,j3djx8,"This is actually not the most extreme version -  if you took the 21 smallest states in the US, you'd still have a smaller collective population than California - but they would collectively have 42 Senators while California still has 2.

Edit: we all understand this was by design when the framers wrote it - the proportions were also very different than what we have today"
6704,j3djx8,"Some folks get pissed when you acknowledge that just because something is constitutional, does not mean that it is democratic by principle.

EDIT: the sheer number of proclaimed democrats who are coming to explain to me why we should be afraid of democracy is pretty telling."
6705,j3djx8,Puerto Rico has a higher population than 21 states
6706,j3djx8,It's by design but doesn't need the design wasn't flawed.
6707,j3djx8,The senates purpose was to represent state interests and use to be selected by state governments not voters. The House of Representatives is meant to represent the people that’s why house seats are based on population. Montana has two senators but only one representative in the house.
6708,j3djx8,"Yes, that, the electoral college, and gerrymandering keep us in the dark ages."
6709,j3djx8,"Yes, that's how it's designed. 2 senators per state, no mater how many states. You're forgetting about the house of representatives. That's the one where each state gets reps based on population of the state with the total number of reps from all states equaling 435 reps"
6710,j3djx8,"Can’t have both, either the senate is reformed, or the electoral college is abolished. This change needs to happen already. 


Also, while we’re at it, Supreme Court term limit (18 years)


Voting Rights Act

Rein in the executive"
6711,j3djx8,Yep. Also functioning as designed. Tyranny of the Minority.
6712,j3djx8,"Should California split into a few smaller states?  I feel like culturally and geographically it might make sense, plus it would increase representation in the Senate.  How about:

Shasta - the more wilderness and forested northern 1/3 of CA

The Bay - already it's own world

Central Valley - Rural and agricultural emphasis, would also include most of the arid areas

The Beach - From LA to San Diego"
6713,j3djx8,Make Puerto Rico a state !
6714,j3djx8,"If we win, can we as Democrats be more bold in our institutional reforms the next two to four years? The GOP has consistently been chipping away at democratic institutions for the past decade, so we should be just as bold in reforming things to make them more small-d democratic."
6715,j3djx8,"Welcome to why the House of Representatives exists. Additionally, if the Senate were based more heavily on population and not on blanket equal representation per state, policies in the large economic states would drastically overshadow the wants of the smaller states. Might as well call it California New York land at that point.

Never mind that people living in smaller, rural areas have basically no representation in the House and only are considered because they provide food to the US and for exports. Or that much of the population in California is concentrated heavily in a few cities where poverty is a rampant disease caused by a flawed system of wealth accumulation on the flayed backs of minimum wage servants. You cant reasonably live in LA on even 2 service jobs unless you live in a shit part of town with roommates.

I understand that the majority of people in the U.S. by population concentration should have weight in the highest levels of government, but that should not come at the expense of smaller states' equal representation. Ideally, this system allows only what works for BOTH the majority and minority states to be passed into Federal law, as it should be. Anything that doesn't pass at a Federal level, so long as it isn't prescribed to the Federal government by the Constitution or Amendments thereof, is up to the States' discretion."
6716,j3djx8,I've been saying it for years cut California in half and staple the fucking Dakotas back together there ain't shit out there anyway.
6717,j3djx8,The house of Representatives exists. DC and PR are not states.
6718,j3djx8,imagine if the yellow party was allowed in any office
6719,j3djx8,Well the house has the representation by population to balance it I guess
6720,j3djx8,"Can someone play devil's advocate, and explain what the R's defense of this is?"
6721,j3djx8,The Senate equally represents the states. The House equally represents the people.
6722,j3djx8,"No, because the Senate isn't about proportional representation, that's *the House*, where California has 53 and those states combined have 47."
6723,j3djx8,Based on these comments I’d say many people in this country need a refresher course is US Government
6724,j3djx8,Now do the House of Representatives
6725,j3djx8,"I'm still okay with 2 Senators per state, I just think DC and PR should be given statehood, and the Senators to go with it."
6726,j3djx8,"To be fair about their point, the OP should’ve shown the other side of “The Great Compromise”."
6727,j3djx8,The House of Representatives exists for a reason
6728,j3djx8,"Y'all know about the house or representatives right? That was the whole point of the fed- anti fed fight when they wrote the bill of rights. It's not like Cali doesn't have 53 representatives, more than any other state.
Edit Puerto Rico needs some representation though."
6729,j3djx8,"You are so stupid, so what your saying is that the only states who can have a meaningful vote are California, New York, Florida, and Texas I can’t understand how so many people liked this😂😂"
6730,j3djx8,"But isn't that the whole point (not DC or Puerto Rico well kinda) but the whole senate thing. When it was created it was meant so that people that lived in smaller states wouldn't be outvoted everytime. The house of representatives has a more even distribution of representatives based on population. If you want more information check out this wiki page. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise

That being said Puerto Rico and DC need to become states. Paying US taxes but not having representation is the whole reason we became a country and it would be hypocrisy not to allow it in turn."
6731,j3djx8,"Or how stupid you are? I’m sorry but come on. First off do I really have to explain to you that Puerto Rico and DC are not states? No statehood, no representation. Second off, like the electoral college, each state much be represented as equally as possible to any other state. Within your state, you’re vote is equal to everyone else’s vote. Nationwide it is not, because each state much be equal to every other state, or as close as possible. With senators you can actually make this equal to have two per state. Each state is equal. One state should never get favored in any way ever over any other state just because they have more people. Think of each state as their own country, in a way. One country should never be able to govern another country just because they have more people. They must all come together equally to elect government that will not only represent themselves equally but govern them equally both by party and by state."
6732,j3djx8,You can’t use senators. That is quite literally the *entire point* of the Senate to be balanced for every state no matter how large or small.
6733,j3djx8,Its ridiculous that California doesn't control the entire country's politics
6734,j3djx8,Ever heard of the house of representatives?????
6735,j3djx8,"Isn't this the point of the senate? Every state gets two, and the house is based on size."
6736,j3djx8,"The idea behind it is the Senate has equal representation between States and the House of Representatives has representation based on population in each State. You can learn this in most civics classes.

Puerto Rico probably should get State-hood, I think they've voted in favor for it a few times (I could be wrong about that part though)."
6737,j3djx8,"Thats... The point. The Senate represents States, the House represents the People"
6738,j3djx8,Isn’t that how the senate is supposed to work tho? No by population but by state.
6739,j3djx8,Public education has failed all of you
6740,j3djx8,"Dont you guys want two states to control the nations vote, and then want to call Donny fascist?"
6741,j3djx8,"yall do know the House of Representatives is a thing right, the point of the senate was to give smaller states a say, so in the Senate the smaller states do have an advantage, but in the House, California has 53 representatives while the 30 states you highlighted have an average of 1.66 representatives."
6742,j3djx8,Now do same map but House of Representatives...
6743,j3djx8,This is exactly why we have a two house system - to prevent tyranny of both the majority and minority...
6744,j3djx8,I don't think there's anything stupid at equal representation for each state.
6745,j3djx8,Ruerto Rico and DC definitely need senators. But we definitely want each state to only have 2 regardless of population.
6746,j3djx8,Have you ever heard of the House of Representatives?
6747,j3djx8,"TIL nobody in the Democrats subreddit actually understands American government, or how the legislative branch of government is organized, or the difference between a state and a territory."
6748,j3djx8,Yet again. Forgets the House of Representatives.
6749,j3djx8,"What do you think the house is for, that’s where population comes into play, you can’t just say fuck Wyoming and everything important to them because few people live there"
6750,j3djx8,"The House of Representatives is based on population, the Senate is equal representation for each state. The is an internal checks and balances to ensure against mob rule. You are complaining about a feature, not a fault."
6751,j3djx8,OP needs a civics class.
6752,j3djx8,Have you guys heard of the House of Representatives? That’s the balance for population
6753,j3djx8,Isn't it the point of the House of Representatives?
6754,j3djx8,"I hate to be that guy, but y’all do know that it was designed this was intentionally, 2 senators from every state, this way bigger states can’t overruled smaller states on everything. However they still do have the House of Representatives which the amount of representatives is based off the population size. So California will have more representatives than all those states. Also Puerto Rico not being a state has always been weird to me, I mean are we ever going to accept them at all?"
6755,j3djx8,"I’m guessing you’ve never taken a basic civics class, lol"
6756,j3djx8,This is an indicator of the effectiveness of Democrats.
6757,j3djx8,They should give the House (which is based on population) more power to even it out with the Senate.
6758,j3djx8,Each state gets two senators what’s difficult?
6759,j3djx8,But if you look at the House of Representatives....
6760,j3djx8,"I don't know how it is in the US, but here in Brazil we have a two house congress to, one house repe
Resents the people (deputy house) so their election is proportional to population in each state and the other house (senate) represent each state of the federation, so it is equal number to represent that each state is equally important."
6761,j3djx8,"Are you guys serious? This is what the House is for. Look up how the senate and the house were decided on being formed to understand why one has a set amount of representatives per state and the other is based on population.

This is some Russia Op level bullshit. Get smarter."
6762,j3djx8,"This is stupid. This is literally the breakdown of the American political process. Yes, California has 2 Senators, but so does every other state. This way, no one state can dominate the legislature. It's called compromise.

This is a stupid post...."
6763,j3djx8,They represent the states not the people
6764,j3djx8,That’s why the House has representation based on population.
6765,j3djx8,Ok now do the same comparison but with the entire house of representatives
6766,j3djx8,and this is why we have the house
6767,j3djx8,What would happen if california was broken up into several States?
6768,j3djx8,The House is the one representative of population.
6769,j3djx8,This is why the House of Representatives exists
6770,j3djx8,"I wouldn’t necessarily call it stupid. We’re a federation on states that posses sovereignty, so the Senate represents the states and their interests. I’m not saying it should or shouldn’t be that way, but there are legitimate arguments for and against."
6771,j3djx8,For a second I was like “fam every state gets two senators” but then I saw the rest and then it clicked.
6772,j3djx8,"You could probably find 15 blue states that have a combined population less than California too. 

I agree that DC and the US territories should be represented in Congress.

Edit:  I did the math and actually you can’t. If you count NH as blue and ME as red, the 11 least populous blue states have about the same population as CA. So 22 senators.  So in that graphic, you could put 10 blue states in the top row and Texas in the middle row. Doesn’t change the fact that millions of Americans are unrepresented."
6773,j3djx8,If the senate was fair it would never be Republican again and they know it.
6774,j3djx8,"Why can’t people realize that in the end the founding fathers are human beings, flaws and all, from a completely different era? Just because something they did worked for them at the time, doesn’t mean that it works for us today. They are not gods. Isn’t the constitution supposed to be a breathing document instead of hardened in amber?"
6775,j3djx8,Yea... that’s the purpose of the senate. You should look at the house if you want to make the comparison to population sizes for each state. The point of the senate is to give every state equal footing no matter the size of the population. It’s meant to protect small states.
6776,j3djx8,"I see you also watched the newest John Oliver. One of his most depressing and hopeless ones yet unfortunately. We really need a constitutional overhaul, but that'll never happen in this political climate."
6777,j3djx8,[deleted]
6778,j3djx8,The Republican Party would be wiped off the face of the earth if there were no Electoral College. They're going to fight like hell to keep it even though it's worthless.
6779,j3djx8,"That is kinda crazy, but I think the House is more population based. Anyways, how much longer will that even be the Cali population? From what I hear everyone is leaving"
6780,j3djx8,Yea that's kind of the point. There's nothing wrong with that. Representatives represent the population. Senators represent the state. It's so smaller states aren't steam rolled by larger states.
6781,j3djx8,I'd like to see a reform where the senate is proportional but the House membership is capped at number of states times five.
6782,j3djx8,"To some extent it makes sense what the writers of the constitution were trying to do here, and i'm willing to grant that smaller populated states deserve broader power than they'd have if everything was based on population, but either the senate or electoral college deciding the president needs to be done by population.

Given the choice i'd rather have the senate remain as it is (altho puerto rico and dc should have representation) and see the president elected solely based on the popular vote."
6783,j3djx8,"Democrats should make it their life’s work to bring peace to the Dakotas and reunite them into a single state, again."
6784,j3djx8,Dont you folks have a delimitation procedure in USA?
6785,j3djx8,I don't see what's wrong with this. Equal representation between the states. Post The figures about how many seats California has in the house compared to the Central States.
6786,j3djx8,"The argument for this has always been ""True democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what's for dinner.""

Everyone reply with the various reasons that's false."
6787,j3djx8,Now do the House of Representatives
6788,j3djx8,"Maybe the actual problem is we have all this focus and rhetoric around Federal government when really we should focus on our State legislators and senators and reps etc. This system doesn’t skew it as much as balance it because otherwise people in smaller states don’t get a voice. Just because I live in the Midwest doesn’t mean I shouldn’t have an equal say in what happens in my country because it still affects me.  I hate to use this example on this subreddit, for obvious reasons but Trump is always talking about how he could fix the problem in Portland if they just call him but it’s a good example of how the country is supposed to function. The state government should handle things at the local level and the federal government should step in if they need it. So for things like Marijuana laws, it’d be nice if it was federally legal but a much more doable task is working to get it legalized in our respective states and taking control through our votes on that level. Some states have done that effectively and it can be done with other things. But also PR should have Senators"
6789,j3djx8,"It’s not stupid the senate is suppose to be where small states can have power the problem is they cap the number of congressmen so that also gives small states power 
The founding fathers wanted a congressmen for every 35,000 to 50,000 people imagine what the house would look like if that was true"
6790,j3djx8,That's not how the Senate works. The Senate is the states representation not the people's. The Congress is the people's representation
6791,j3djx8,Puerto Rico doesn’t want senators
6792,j3djx8,Abolish the senate. It's an outdated institution that doesn't reflect America today.
6793,j3djx8,Ludicrous
6794,j3djx8,"Are we seriously having this discussion? 

The ENTIRE POINT of the structure of the 2 legislative bodies (House- based on population and Senate- based solely on each State being represented in the federal government) AND the ENTIRE POINT of the Electoral College is to PROTECT THE VOICES OF THE MINORITY GROUP SO THE MAJORITY CAN'T JUST STEAMROLL THE MINORITY. 

This seems to be pissing a bunch of you off right now because you feel like your voices are part of the majority so it *obviously* should be your way, but what happens when your voice and political philosophy are no longer in the majority? Don't you still want to be able to have a say in how the government functions? 

It's very clear some (a clear few) of you never paid attention in school, or had shitty teachers who didn't explain these points, but the reality is that public opinion changes over time. If we redesign the system to ONLY favor the majority, at some point we will ALL find ourselves on the minority view. 

A pure democracy sounds good right now because you feel like your voice doesn't matter as much, but that's not true. The representative democracy we have absolutely protects your voice as a free citizen. A direct democracy is a system that can be abused too easily and can lead to extreme oppression for whoever lands on the ""wrong"" side for a very, very long time."
6795,j3djx8,We need Puerto Rico and Washington DC to become states the mayority of the population their want statehood I think they should give it to them and make binding referemdums on the issue.
6796,j3djx8,"This was the oldest fight in America. We have a bicameral congress for this reason. The House of Reps is based on population. That being said, the senate holds too much power."
6797,j3djx8,Pheck the electoral college
6798,j3djx8,And... thank goodness for the House of Representatives where The Peoples Strongest Voice can be heard.
6799,j3djx8,"This is how the Senate is supposed to work the empowering balance comes from the fact that the House of Representatives has not been expanded as population has grown since the 40s. 

If there were as many representatives in the house as they're supposed to be, the Senate would be held in check."
6800,j3djx8,"Well it’s by design, the senate represents the states, the House of Representatives represents the people"
6801,j3djx8,"If they refuse to do something about it, the answer is clear: 

We as Democrats plan an elaborate scheme to all—on one single day—move into these states so we keep our majorities in safe blue states and expand it in places never thought possible. We will use election and census data to know where our move will have the most value so not as many Democrats have to endure moving to Wyoming. The states with the smallest population will obviously be our best bet. Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska... we can make all of them blue.

Then we will have the ability to pass meaningful amendments with our dispersement of votes across all the states. Supreme Court term limits? Done. Ending the Electoral College? Done. Expanding the size of the House of Representatives to better reflect America? Done. Changing Article I to make sure the Senate better reflects the American people? Done.

Once that is done, we all move back and enjoy our new America."
6802,j3djx8,"Yep, they have even [gerrymandered the SENATE](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/05/08/how-republicans-gerrymandered-the-senate/)."
6803,j3djx8,Those thirty states are twenty nine big fat white faces and Tim Scott. “Republicans”
6804,j3djx8,"The senate was designed to give low population slave states an equal voice in the federal government with urban states.  It’s a compromise because of slavery.

You could argue similar conditions exist for rural vs urban states today.  You could even argue DC should remain a territory since it contains the Capitol (though I wouldn’t).  But there is no good argument for denying Puerto Rico senate representation.

Statehood for PR and DC, ASAP."
6805,j3djx8,"I mean, house of reps has general representation based on population, Senate is meant for smaller states to still be able to have a say in anything at all. The goal is to have rule of the majority while protecting the minority. That being said, feel like that only works if the Senate and HoR get a say in everything, which isn't always the case but oh well"
6806,j3djx8,So break up California
6807,j3djx8,What's wrong with this???
6808,j3djx8,"TBF you should swap cali with texas and sub 30m republicans with small democratic states. Not saying its equal, but this meme doesnt tell the whole story."
6809,j3djx8,Taxation with out representation
6810,j3djx8,why do people always forget about Guam and Samoa
6811,j3djx8,"The Senate was created to behave like this. The issue is limiting the size of the House of Representatives. This limits the populist balance that should be coming from the House. 

Since limiting membership to 435, the number of citizens in the average district has gone from ~200k to ~700k. Since each state gets at least one, it increases the relative voice of smaller states. Instead of 1 for WY and 53 for CA today, it would be 3 and 195. That’s a significant reduction of power for CA."
6812,j3djx8,California should be broken up into 3 to 5 states.
6813,j3djx8,"Yeah its totally the system that forced Gavin Newsom to veto a bill that would have forced transparency on the tax records of massive companies that do business in california.

&#x200B;

The only reason that people are constantly blaming the system for keeping things from working is because politicians don't work for the people."
6814,j3djx8,"Dear Californians moving out of state bc of home prices/fires/etc.

These are priority destinations."
6815,j3djx8,So gross. And racist. And sexist
6816,j3djx8,"Just sayin the reason this was the case is so that the huge population centers don't overwhelm rural farmers with laws that are bad for them.  Not saying this is good for our country (i live in a huge city and am a democrat) just that this is literally by design and is supposed to be balanced by the house, although I haven't done the math to determine to what extent it actually is."
6817,j3djx8,CA could always split.
6818,j3djx8,The founders did this intentionally
6819,j3djx8,The shit hole states.
6820,j3djx8,"Puerto Rico is a territory with enough population to become a state, it’s just that there is more pressing maters facing the USA and you shouldn’t expect the paper work to make its way through until we there’s a cool down while a dem is in office."
6821,j3djx8,30 senators of the worst kind of human beings you could find out there!
6822,j3djx8,They call the presidential winner while Hawaii polls are still open. Their votes don't matter on the presidential level.
6823,j3djx8,"Senate represents the states. House represents the states' popupation. I know it's wrong, but we have to come up with a better idea of checks and balances. The legislative branch in a presidential republic is really stupid."
6824,j3djx8,"The whole point, is to make all states equal in the senate. Not all people, mind you, but all states. This is the design of the system. The USA was engineered as a federation of colonies, not a nation."
6825,j3djx8,"This is an example of states rights.. they felt we were the United STATES of America... 

Well things have changed and the federal government is now huge. This old system just doesn’t totally make sense anymore."
6826,j3djx8,"My wife and her family (who are native Puerto Ricans) want Puerto Rico to be independent. 

I don’t blame them. In fact I agree. If it wouldn’t be so challenging because of their current conditions, they could probably pull it off. Being a state, I think they would become another Hawaii or Alaska. Useful when needed - troublesome when not."

6828,j3djx8,"But the big states will tyranize the little states! How else could I, some asshole from Wyoming keep America stuck in the past?"
6829,j3djx8,"I understand the frustration at the Senate, but it’s important to remember, especially now, that distance from the general public can be valuable in governing. The senate exists to act as a balance against an angry mob of people lording over everyone else, and to ensure that the states are treated fairly. 

An angry mob of highly motivated people being able to exert too much power is exactly what led to Donald Trump becoming president."
6830,j3djx8,I see someone else is a John Oliver fan.
6831,j3djx8,"I mean, that is literally how it’s intended to be to balance the house. Puerto Rico and DC definitely deserve senators tho"
6832,j3djx8,Should countries have representation in the UN based on their population? I'm sure China and India would like that.
6833,j3djx8,"The idea is if both the house and senate were population based, then there would be nothing stopping legislation being passed that blatantly fucked over the low population mid western states that provide most of our nations produce and food. I agree the house should have more power and be the dominant of the 2 parts of congress, but getting rid of all representation of the Midwest/rural states means they’ll be ignored more than they already are."
6834,j3djx8,"The thing is we also have a House of Representatives which is based on population. Also the reasoning of this is that should we not have something like the senate what could end up happening is that policy and laws are made without the day of the lower population states as they wouldn’t have any say. This also ties into the electoral college which is there specifically so presidential candidates can’t ignore smaller population states and their opinions because if we went on just popular vote it would mean that campaigns would only target high population states. This system was made this way for a reason, different states have different needs and      should only population matter there is not incentive to address smaller population states issues."
6835,j3djx8,"That's what the House is for.

On D.C. and Puerto Rico:

The territories don't exist and no one has really pressured Congress to grant them the political power that they should have. It isn't 1899 anymore."
6836,j3djx8,What were the founding fathers thinking when they didn’t want a complete majority rule for every branch of government. Plz explain
6837,j3djx8,I wish Biden supported abolishing the electoral college :(
6838,j3djx8,"I know this is rediculous and would never happen, but a solution would be to split larger states like cali into smaller states. The red states would never do this because of state pride and the new (presumably blue) states would also add senate seats. Sucks about PR and DC though."
6839,j3djx8,"It’s an exchange for having those states in the union. If it was all done based on population then why would a rural, very conservative Christian state want to be part of the union. It would have to abide by all the laws the liberal population enacted with no real way to fight back. It’s a practical solution for a country whose land mass is so huge and population spread out"
6840,j3djx8,"It's a lot less stupid if you think about it like 50 countries in a union.

United states, if you will."
6841,j3djx8,"Its called equal representation among states. Its actually to protect the minority ( not just ethnicity but also beliefs). The house of representatives is to accurately reflect population while the senate is for equal representation of the states. The best example i can give is to assume the worst in people. Lets say the whole US was completely and 100% divided by race (throw out all current state of affairs) let's say whites, Hispanics, African Americans, Asians ect. If all in one race united (wont ever and should never happen) then the highest number of one race wins. According to Wikipedia, 74% of the US is white. If under the impossible scenario that all races divided and united under some ridiculous race war, then all other races would be silenced, other than white, because they would never account (under today's demographics) enough vote to have a voice. The same goes for people of associated values and beliefs. This is a country of ""united"" states. People forget that each state is different and while each state is ran independently for a good many reasons (say California/New York have a lot different beliefs/lifestyles than say Montana or Texas) we are governed/under one federal government. So you don't want congress to be run without equal representation from each state. Each state gets a voice as they are all subject to the same laws passed by congress. I know this will be downvoted for many reasons but its the honest truth. You want equal representation or else its mob rule. Mob rule is what caused many problems of the past."
6842,j3djx8,Yeah that's what Congress is for
6843,j3djx8,"We are not a Democracy. We are a Republic. The balance of Senators was always to make every state have equal representation in the senate. While many may disagree with it, it is an important part of our system. The best way to fix it. Move liberals to all over the country will fix this."
6844,j3djx8,This is why we have the House of Representatives that are based on population and why would Porter Rico get any senator’s it’s not a state neither is DC.
6845,j3djx8,"I mean, it's like that to give smaller states a voice... That's also why The House of Representatives exists...

Also yes both Puerto Rico and D.C. should be granted statehood, however, it's tricky for D.C. :/"
6846,j3djx8,Do the college of representatives next!!!
6847,j3djx8,"Fucking morons, the Senate was created this way to prevent large states from trampling small states. The House is where all people are approximately equal.

The fact that DC, Puerto Rico and other US Territories do not have any representation, is somewhat a product of their own making. They have had the opportunity to become states and have chosen not to."
6848,j3djx8,"Funny, that's how donny happened"
6849,j3djx8,When people realize Puerto Rico has no income tax...
6850,j3djx8,[removed]
6851,j3djx8,"Yes, I can appreciate how stupid you are."
6852,j3djx8,I see an easy solution people from california move to those states
6853,j3djx8,That's alot of white folks in power ... Just one black dude....america.. can you please change....   The world is sick of your shit.  Youv turned into china ccp cringe.
6854,j3djx8,What about the rest of the US territories?
6855,j3djx8,"I don’t know what you’re talking about, D.C. is full of Senators.

Plus, Puerto Rico doesn’t get Senators. That island is like a pet of the family. It gets to sleep in the house and gets food, but doesn’t get to sit at the table."
6856,j3djx8,"So an equal representation system? Two are territories, and one is not the country. If California really cared so much than secede?"
6857,j3djx8,One state cannot be as powerful as a third of the nation...
6858,j3djx8,Vermont and Delaware only gave 1 member in the House of Representatives.  The senate is based on state. The house is population based. This is us civics 101...
6859,j3djx8,Soooo we should send large tech companies to all of their capitals to get more liberals out to the rest of the country?
6860,j3djx8,"This is exactly why the Senate was created enlarge states don't have all the power. The founding fathers probably didnt think I was going to get this disproportional but getting rid if the senate would give those middle states no power. I like the idea of adding Guma, PR and DC. Maybe splitting states like California, texas, and New York would help too and should be looked into."
6861,j3djx8,"Something something something, if amarica had only a by popular vote system you would only need to campaign in 3 or 5 states and only care about what the people who live in cities need, thus making low population states and poorer regions have no say or ability to interact with the government. Is it the best system, no, is it a system that works, eh sometimes, can the USA do better, probably."
6862,j3djx8,That's... the point of the Senate though?
6863,j3djx8,Token black guy
6864,j3djx8,"I mean, that's what the House of Representatives is for, representation based on population. Puerto Rico voted to become a state a few years ago (super low turnout due to a boycott on the election) so.................... and DC has a statehood movement so we're on the way to having 104 Senators soon."
6865,j3djx8,The USA democracy has so so many problems that set against the Swiss (for example) it might not qualify as one.
6866,j3djx8,The worst part was seeing Lindsay Graham’s stupid face.
6867,j3djx8,"Yeah, you guys don't actually have a fair or properly functioning democracy."
6868,j3djx8,"Yeah we can acknowledge how stupid it is for a second and then move on with the understanding that this advantage will never be overcome by complaining about it to the party that is receiving the benefit of it (Republicans). If Joe gets in and we get the Senate back, we need to add DC and PR as states and then resettle Dems in Wyoming and Florida."
6869,j3djx8,Whats the population got to do with anything? You are called the United States of America.
6870,j3djx8,States are stupid anyway.  Either we’re a country or we’re not.
6871,j3djx8,That's literally the point of the senate.
6872,j3djx8,"That's stupid, in Switzerland it's based on the population"
6873,j3djx8,"now I'm not American, so I apologise if I get something wrong, but here in Switzerland we have just the same and it's completely fine? we have the senate (probably not actual name), that's 2 people from every canton regardless of population and then we have the national council which is always 200 people and distributed to cantons by their population, isn't that what your representatives are? how is it a problem to have the states themselves represented in a place?

also is Puerto Rico a state? I thought that was another country. however I do agree the Washington DC thing is kinda messed up, I really don't know why you can't just have your capital is one of your States."
6874,j3djx8,Fuck them
6875,j3djx8,"Bruh. Every state has 2 Senators. No matter the population. It’s to give the smaller states the same voice as the larger states. The House of Representatives is based on population. So a bigger populus will have more representation. It’s so that Montana, with its population of 6 goats, can’t overpower the vote from New York City’s 7m+. 

40% of the United States population lives within 60 miles of a coastline. The setup of the Congress makes sure their vote doesn’t suppress the vote of those living inland. Or urban vs rural in a sense. 

Puerto Rico and DC would have to become states to get representation in Congress. Why they haven’t, is probably up to some sleazy politician."
6876,j3djx8,"And yet Republicans lose their S H I T at the idea of abolishing the electoral college because ""tyranny of the majority"" blah blah fuck them."
6877,j3djx8,"""Can we take a break from Donny for a sec...""

*Trump gettin' the Rona has entered the chat*"
6878,j3djx8,Now imagine if it was the opposite..
6879,j3djx8,I am not sure Puerto Rico would be the slam dunk for Democratic senators that people expect.  Also not sure the island's desire for statehood is strong enough to get it done quickly.
6880,j3djx8,"It’s meant for state power. The founding fathers believed giving the people having full control would be anarchy, and they are still kinda correct in that assumption. But for Costa Rica and DC, since they are not republican, there not states, I guess lol"
6881,j3djx8,"Aside from the last part, I think it makes sense

If we were gonna have the government be 100% proportional, what would even be the point of having different states? Any time the majority of the country agrees that X should be illegal, it's suddenly illegal everywhere, even if 100% of, say, Hawaiians don't like it. With this system, you need a majority of the people *and* a majority of the states to agree to make something the rule, which is the idea. If a state likes a politicy but it's not popular nationwide, then *in theory* that state can make the policy for itself.

Of course, it has the issue that it tends to entrench. If 51% of people and 26 states like something today, but tomorrow opinions change and while 26 states still like the policy but only 20% of people feel that way, an unpopular policy still stays."
6882,j3djx8,"So the Senate was intended to simply represent the states voice, while the House was meant to (at least try) be proportional to the population. However it should be noted that the difference in the populations between the largest and smallest states during Washingtons Presidency was 10 to 1. The difference between the largest and smallest state pops now is closer to 100 to 1. The Senate has been invested with too much of the authority. We re supposed to be a government of, by and for the people. The house should be the Upper body of Congress while the Senate should be moved down to the Lower body. That would satisfy me, even though as a Californian my representation per population ratio is worse than Wyoming. I can live with that, I don't like the fact that people claim the Senate is the reflection of the will of the people. We don't ever vote for the entirety of the Senate, it's seats were spaced out over 3 election cycles a very very long time ago. Control of the Senate now rests more in the math of the map for any given election cycle than it does with the voters. Swap the place and standing of the 2 bodies."
6883,j3djx8,"No, I'm sorry, we cannot. We're still basking in the glorious news.

American Democracy shall survive!!!"
6884,j3djx8,Hi. I always thought of myself as a Republican until the 2016 primaries. Then I made my first $10 political donation to https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/
6885,j3djx8,#Breakupcali They can break it up into 4 states and then we add Puerto Rico and Dc.
6886,j3djx8,From Puerto Rico. We technically have a representative that can speak and not vote. So yeah. Sucks.
6887,j3djx8,"Now do one with just Mitch McConnell and 800,000 people that voted for him."
6888,j3djx8,"That’s because there are 2 separate houses. Each state gets 2 representatives in the senate. In the House of Representatives on the other hand, that is more based on population and land. The whole point of having 2 houses with one being equal in terms of representation is because they wanted equal representation within one house."
6889,j3djx8,"Yup. Pretty messed up. 

We need to restructure."
6890,j3djx8,oof looks like Puerto Rico gets the  b o o t
6891,j3djx8,"I thought that was the entire point of the Senate though.  As opposed to representation based on population (aka most populous states have more delegates) the Senate makes every state equal.  I'm not arguing wether it is right or not, but I thought it was exactly the point of it."
6892,j3djx8,"Thier purpose was define it as republican vs democrats.

You get my upvote for doing the math!"
6893,j3djx8,"Not only that, but the states highlighted actually represent around 40 million people, rather than 30 million."
6894,j3djx8,"I mean, the enslavement of black people was written into the constitution as constitutional. 

We did fix it a little though. 

Now it’s just prisoners who can legally be enslaved."
6895,j3djx8,"The point was to give all states an equal say in one house of legislation so a state like rhode island has a voice. Does this seem unfair to you? Honest question, I’ve never seen this as an issue before"
6896,j3djx8,That part of the Constitution isn't meant to be democratic like you think. It's a compromise between the New Jersey Plan and the Virginia Plan to get the document ratified.
6897,j3djx8,">when you acknowledge that just because something is constitutional, does not mean that it is democratic by principle.

&#x200B;

The problem is not the fact that each state has two senators the fact is we have a two party system witch means it's easy for partisanship and one party to take over one branch

I think   "" great comprise""  in theory is in short a great comprise, William Paterson was  right that basing the the legislative on population would give to much power to bigger states and  much influence over countries interest and politics, witch is undemocratic, We are the **United** States of America meaning every state should have a equal vote no mater how big or small.

However with a Two party system this system is not working as the founding fathers intended.

>""There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.""-- John Adams"
6898,j3djx8,"This May be uno unpopular, but subduing being more den debits doesn't mean it's better. Every concentration of power needs checks,including the people. That's one of the things the founders feared b tyranny of the majority. 

I'm not saying I agree (or disagree) with the Senate, I'm just saying that something being not democratic is bit always bad."
6899,j3djx8,And because something is constitutional doesn’t mean morally just
6900,j3djx8,It is an artifact of the great compromise and the only way they could sell a unified nation. Trump really ruined everything.
6901,j3djx8,"Well this is not undemocratic per se. USA as the name implies is an union of individual states, not people. Each state is equal in the senate like every nation is equal in the UN general assembly. The founders of US thought that every state and their population would develop their own identities.
That is also partly the reason why some people say that the civil war was fought for state rights. In this regard it is correct as the most fundamental cause of the civil war was the conflict of authority between the federal government and individual states, which boiled down to the question of slavery and whether the federal government can abolish it in every state without their consent."
6902,j3djx8,The constitution is really stacked against democracy
6903,j3djx8,It is not supposed to be democratic. That is what the House is for. The Senate is to represent the *states'* interests.
6904,j3djx8,"Senators aren't* there to represent the people though, like, by definition. That's why there are 2 chambers of congress - the House represents the people and the senate representsa states, and all states are equal in the eyes of the union..."
6905,j3djx8,"We dont live in a Democracy. We live in a constitutional republic.  


 [Democracy](https://imgur.com/a/RXPrRYo)"
6906,j3djx8,"The United States is a republic. A lot a you don’t seem to grasp that concept. Also Puerto Rico isn’t even a state, so yeah it makes sense. It’s by design that way so that we don’t have the major population hubs deciding everything for our country."
6907,j3djx8,Maybe...just maybe...the US isn’t a democracy? 🤔
6908,j3djx8,Almost like we’re a constitutional republic not a straight democracy
6909,j3djx8,">EDIT: the sheer number of proclaimed democrats who are coming to explain to me why we should be afraid of democracy is pretty telling.

&#x200B;

Telling how?"
6910,j3djx8,Maybe it should apply for statehood then?
6911,j3djx8,"I bet ranked choice voting would turn a lot of those seats into Libertarian ones, achieving a far better balance of power."
6912,j3djx8,"Yes but it was built at a time when state differences where not that huge. Eg the smallest being Rhode Island vs the largest Virginia.

Here we’re talking about California being 80 (80!) times larger than Wyoming and have the same representation in the Senate.

Add to that that small states are favored twice: Senate and Electoral College and it’s even worse.

Pick one. If you’re gonna keep the Senate skewing for small rural states like Wyoming and the Dakotas, than at least have the president elected by popular vote.

Keeping both just is a huge skew to small states.

In essence, having both Senate and POTUS more elected by small states makes Scotus a monopoly of small states, especially rural ones.

Hence why in a country where Democrats consistently get more votes than Republicans, we have a huge GOP Justice majority."
6913,j3djx8,"Except that the House and the Senate are not equal in power, and the fact that both other branches are also heavily skewed to favor states over people (Since the Executive Branch selects the Supreme Court candidate and the Senate confirms it).

So cool, there's 1/2 of one branch that actually is Democratic while 2.5 branches are not. Totally makes it equal /s"
6914,j3djx8,That was when state houses senators. Now the people elect senators. It kind of defeats the point.
6915,j3djx8,"The problem is that issues like health care, defense and social security depend on federal tax dollars. So it really is much more than state interests. They define policy for all of the big money issues that affect us all.

If they want to walk away from federal funding provided my blue states, that is fine with us."
6916,j3djx8,Wyoming has about the same population as Fresno. Why does Wyoming need two senators but Fresno doesn't?
6917,j3djx8,"Thank you, intelligent stranger"
6918,j3djx8,The electoral college as an idea is not a problem. The primary issue with the electoral college as it is used today comes down to the way that states have chosen to order their electors to behave.
6919,j3djx8,"Yeah this has such bad reasoning. 

I get the puerto rico and dc part, that's fine. But the rest is deliberately missing the point and I'm disappointed that it even has upvotes."
6920,j3djx8,"I think it's reasonable to set a high bar for federal laws to be passed. Otherwise, what's the point having separate states?"
6921,j3djx8,"It’s true that we might be in our own world, but we are Californians and we do not want the state broken up.

Also I think anyone who says we should split up CA is underestimating how red a significant chunk of our state actually is. If the Bay Area is it’s own separate state, you’re concentrating all that blue. We’re blue along the coast, but not as you go inland."
6922,j3djx8,No thank you. We're good. There is a reason that we Californians say no to this every time somebody tries to put it on the ballot.
6923,j3djx8,"Being large also gives you power: example, leading the fight in climate change despite Scotus and POTUS opposition. 

California sets it’s only pro-environment and anti-pollution laws, and manufacturers all over have to follow, despite what the GOP EPA says, if they want access to the largest economy in the US."
6924,j3djx8,"Shasta is cool, but some of the locals will get upset if you don't call it the State of Jefferson.

As addendum, you're idea sucks for California. It would destroy their economic and political power. The state's infrastructure would fall apart fast. It would be just as bad as republican states."
6925,j3djx8,"Ugh, I would not welcome that fight. And it would be a nasty fight. The drawing of the state lines would basically be a chance to gerrymander turned up to 11. Split rural and coast and a blue state turns to one red, one blue. Split with each new state being representative of the whole and you get several blue states."
6926,j3djx8,"We may have our cultural differences in the state, but we are all proud Californians and do not want our state broken up, nor would we ever allow it. There is a reason why this fails every single time it's brought up"
6927,j3djx8,"If this happens, Texas will just split into 5 states (which they are allowed to do)"
6928,j3djx8,We’d probably rather be our own nation over splitting the state.
6929,j3djx8,"How about consolidating all the  little states into few bigger ones, instead? /s"
6930,j3djx8,From what I understand the Dakotas share many state resources. They only split because the territory simply looked too big.
6931,j3djx8,Ah and conveniently add a blue state and remove a red one
6932,j3djx8,"But they should be. Both areas are large numbers of American citizens that are deprived of their civil right to participate in electoral matters.

I can see the argument for not making DC a state, due to its status as the federal seat, but to deprive the American citizens of Puerto Rico of their constitutional rights is morally abject."
6933,j3djx8,"The house of representatives was also capped at a constant 435 seats in the 1929 apportionment act. Since then, the average pop. size of a congressional district has tripled, from 210,328 individuals in 1910 to 710,767 induviduals in 2010. So its not really working the way it was originally designed to, either."
6934,j3djx8,Also cheddar is a type of cheese.
6935,j3djx8,Even the house over-represents small states...
6936,j3djx8,The country might survive
6937,j3djx8,The Senate is supposed to represent the states not the people. The Congress is supposed to represent the people. It's part of checks and balances so New York and California don't make the laws for the rest of the nation.
6938,j3djx8,There is no actual defense. It's all bad faith. The only thing Republicans care about is holding power. So how do they do that when you clearly have more liberal voters in the country? Hang on to an antiquated system that no longer makes sense.
6939,j3djx8,"Same reason China only gets one vote at the U.N. despite holding 18 percent of the world's population.

It's not perfect logic, but it's not as terrible as Reddit constantly makes it out to be."
6940,j3djx8,And is almost as bad because the amount has been capped for decades...
6941,j3djx8,Basic civics has left the chat
6942,j3djx8,I can say fuck Wyoming what the fuck are they afraid of exactly?
6943,j3djx8,"Well in some ways the house does have more power, for example any taxation bill has to originate in the House.
But of course the Senate is fundamentally undemocratic. And the balance of power is certainly not equal."
6944,j3djx8,[deleted]
6945,j3djx8,More Senators!
6946,j3djx8,"Just because there’s a reason, doesn’t mean it’s a good system. There’s a historical reason behind everything in the world, not all of it good."
6947,j3djx8,Some of them realized it will screw them in the coming decade or next. AZ is on the verge of going blue.  GA & TX aren't many cycles behind.  At that point they lose 69 votes.  Trumps margin in 2016 was 36.  They have no route to 270 at that point even if you pretend every state Trump won in 2016 is red going forward.
6948,j3djx8,I think it would be a good thing if California and New York decided every election.
6949,j3djx8,"The population of California in 2019 was 39,512,223, a 0.13% increase from 2018.

The population of California in 2018 was 39,461,588, a 0.26% increase from 2017.

The population of California in 2017 was 39,358,497, a 0.49% increase from 2016.

The population of California in 2016 was 39,167,117, a 0.64% increase from 2015."
6950,j3djx8,"The House is just one part of Congress and the Senate has more power. Constitutionally, they're supposed to share more power since the House originates all budget bills, but functionally that's a mere formality compared to the Senate's Advise and Consent power. 

Also, California has slower growth because of greater emigration to other states, but it's still positive and likely will be the for the foreseeable future. It's an economic powerhouse and one of the country's primary entrepôts for new immigrants."
6951,j3djx8,"I made this sane comment, but some people don't understand. It's not even a party issue, it's just how our government works"
6952,j3djx8,Would the name of the house change to house of the unrepresentatives? :D
6953,j3djx8,Curious why not do something closer to our current number of reps and have x10 or so?
6954,j3djx8,Billionaires and tech giants could just seed a new city on the borders of 3 small midwest states.  They'd be able to take their 6 senators over time.
6955,j3djx8,"Even if we put aside that equal representation of the states is pretty unnecessary with most of what the Senate does: California is also underrepresented in the house compared to smaller states. It has something like 65 times the population and 53 times the delegates compared to Wyoming, meaning Wyoming's house representative has around 20% more voting power than any of California's based on the people they represent.

This is even further exacerbated in the electoral college where a vote in Wyoming is equal to more than three in California.

The Senate is more noticeably skewed, but our country has a severe problem with representing the will of the people in a lot of its systems, much if it by design."
6956,j3djx8,So it is unfair if you don’t get equal say because you live in a Midwest but it is perfectly fair I don’t get my equal say because I live in CA. I totally understand your concern I just fail to see why I am less important than you.
6957,j3djx8,"If that's its current goal, the current electoral college doesn't achieve it. It protects one specific minority (the least populous states) by oppressing a different minority (the more partisan states who don't get any attention).

The Senate was originally elected by the state governments, not the population.

So the system was set up to protect one specific minority group: the wealthiest landowners who controlled the state governments and didn't want to lose any power in the new federal government. That's why the Senate exists and why the less populous states get more electoral votes. It didn't care about any other minority groups, only what would be judicious toward the goal of everyone's agreeing to the Constitution."
6958,j3djx8,"Ok but why we only protect minority based on their location? If protecting minority is so vital, why can’t give more voting power to minority based on their race? Or age? Or religion? Or income. After all there is way more common between typical California resident and Virginia resident than there are between typical middle class work men and the wealthiest minority. If the goal is to truly protect minority, those minorities should be identified based on some truly meaningful criteria not a zip code."
6959,j3djx8,"> the senate holds too much power


It's treason then"
6960,j3djx8,Aren't those mainly just military bases
6961,j3djx8,Does Samoa want statehood?  Federal laws would ruin them.  The disparity between their economy and that of the states is huge.
6962,j3djx8,Guam probably would want statehood Samoa I'm not so sure.
6963,j3djx8,"Most of Californians came from other states. Those Dear Virginians, or Dear Georgians. They had their reasons to leave their states. USA is very mobile country, always been."
6964,j3djx8,That kind of disdain for rural and working class people is why the democrats lost in 2016.
6965,j3djx8,"Sure. 

I know you don’t say you agree either way but also worth noting that at the time the largest state was Virginia at I think like 110,000 voting population* and only about 7x the smallest state. 

I don’t know if the Framers ever actually imagined we’d get to this point.

*unfortunately very different than total"
6966,j3djx8,"See my above comment

>Except that the House and the Senate are not equal in power, and the fact that both other branches are also heavily skewed to favor states over people (Since the Executive Branch selects the Supreme Court candidate and the Senate confirms it).  
>  
>So cool, there's 1/2 of one branch that actually is Democratic while 2.5 branches are not. Totally makes it equal /s"
6967,j3djx8,"It is,  but since the senate is “higher” than congress it lets small broke mismanaged racist shithole republican states fuck over the whole country all the goddamn motherfucking time because any legislation that congress comes up with has to go through them before it heads to the Oval Office."
6968,j3djx8,It is the entire point. And it's a bad point.
6969,j3djx8,"That is the point, but the senate was supposed to be balanced with the house. Presently, the number of house of representatives is capped at 435 which is much lower than if states were given true representation in the house. This further dilutes the power of people who live in a heavily populated state. If we actually apportioned representatives to the population of states, more populous states would have fairer representation."
6970,j3djx8,"The point of the Senate was to get smaller states to sign the Constitution. That's it. The Senate and the House are a compromise between little states wanting power and big states wanting power. Of course, that shouldn't matter. The Senate *should* be proportionate to population too."
6971,j3djx8,"It was based on the nice idee of stopping the tyranny of the majority by giving more power to another chamber of government where majority did not count. Unfortunately instead it lead to a tragedy of tyranny by the minority, where one party simply hijacked populist idea to get enough senator and fuck everything up. 

Watching the result, I will take the ""majority"" vote ANY TIME over the shit show the senate/congress is in the US. 

The US is so strong politically and economically because of its continental isolation, richness of resource , hijack of territory from the locals, protection from most WW damage (due to isolation) , IN SPITE of a terrible political system.

Think what it could have been if instead of constant blowjob to the plutocratic ruling class, it had a social net as strong as many country have. Think about this for one minute."
6972,j3djx8,"Call me crazy but the Founders idea of ""EVERY STATE IS BASICALLY A DIFFERENT COUNTRY"" doesn't fly in the modern world. 

Whole concepts of states would be obsolete with decent high speed rail 
 
I want to move on from the whole ""CALI IS A COMMIE CESSPOOL THE SOUTH IS FULL OF RACIST"" divisive rhetoric in this country 

Show me someone who hates Califonria or the South and I'll show you someone who's never been to either of those places"
6973,j3djx8,"Thing is, states are imaginary lines we draw on a map and populations are actual humans. How this allocation of senators is decided is beyond my tiny european brain"
6974,j3djx8,Now you can arrest as many black people as you like and enslave them!
6975,j3djx8,"Ya, all we gotta do is arrest ‘em first. Just added a layer.

/s, kindof."
6976,j3djx8,"I understand what you mean. But frankly I disagree with the logic of the concept. 

A state is not a living thing. It is an institution that is designed to represent the people that live within it. By having a body that provides equal say to each state, you are creating a system in which one citizen has less of a political voice than other citizens based solely upon the fact that they live closer to more citizens.

If you have a unicameral system that is based entirely upon population, each individual citizen has equal political voice regardless of where they live within the country."
6977,j3djx8,"When they capped the number of representatives in the house they made it so that rural red states are overrepresented in the House, the Senate, and the Electoral College. Now I do not think that thousands of reps is the best idea, but something should be changed."
6978,j3djx8,Constitutional compromises don’t have to be revered for their wisdom - but rather they should be viewed as a political compromise made at the time. Most famously is the “three-fifths” compromise which is one of the most disgusting and shameful components of the document.
6979,j3djx8,"The constitution itself was not intended to be a truly democratic document. But as a society centuries removed from the founding, it is a truly democratic society that we should be aspiring to."
6980,j3djx8,So the solution is more senators and PR to help break the 2 party system as well as let the minority in a state to get representation.
6981,j3djx8,"If the senate was directly proportional like the house it would be kind of pointless since it would be duplicative, just like the upper chambers in the states.  However, the disparity in the representation in the senate is exceptionally extreme.  Other countries have disparities in their upper chambers.  Japan has tinkered a little to improve theirs.  In the UK, it was filled with unelected aristocrats and appointed political elites.  They blocked a ton of necessary reforms from the lower chamber.  That was only solved by the monarch stepping in.   Their power has been neutered ever since.  

In the US, the senate situation is unsustainable.  It is projected half the population will live in 8 states in the future and 75% in 15 states.  Big states either split or the system will crumble (I'm assuming reforms to give big states more senators will be harder than state splitting)."
6982,j3djx8,"Why should the power of the people be checked? Who benefits by limiting our authority? 

You are right that the founders feared the authority of the people (which they referred to as tyranny). The founders were the minority, oligarchs who deprived those without property, women and people of color of the right to vote.

They were the ultra-rich of the country in their day. Perhaps some can consider that excusable because it was a different time, but why would we limit the authority of the people in 2020?"
6983,j3djx8,"Legality is not the same as morality.

It's something to keep in mind at all times."
6984,j3djx8,So was the 3/5 compromise - in fact they are directly related. It was a jockeying for power for the men who were influential in their respective state politics. None of it was about true democratic representation.
6985,j3djx8,"The problems that we face have existed long before Trump came to office. He is a symptom of the problem, not the cause."
6986,j3djx8,"In the European Union representation is not equal for each state - there is some weighting for population much like the House of Representatives.

The idea that the legislative branch must have a bicameral system with the “Upper House” having equal apportionment among states was a choice made as a compromise.

The UN itself is structured with a Security Council consisting of permanent members like the United States who have much more power than smaller nations. UN resolutions also don’t have the same force of law over sovereign nations because the ability to enforce anything does not exist in the same manner as exists in the Executive branch of the Federal Government."
6987,j3djx8,"Yeah, and that made some sense with 13 states 250 years ago.

I don’t think it makes sense now."
6988,j3djx8,"That doesn't change the fact that it's undemocratic.

Everything that you said is true, but anything that deprives citizens of equal voting power is inherently undemocratic, regardless of the history behind it."
6989,j3djx8," you're right in a lot of what you're saying but I have to disagree with your claim that the Civil you're right in a lot of what you're saying but I have to disagree with your claim that the Civil War was about states rights. Even though you can see that that the states rights boil down to slavery, it was not about Federal Authority versus States Authority. The slave states were perfectly fine with Federal authorities superseding states rights when it benefit of them such as the Fugitive Slave Act. It wasn't about states rights, that was always, always an excuse. They only cared about states rights when states rights upheld there slavery institution."
6990,j3djx8,Was CA highly populated when it was admitted to the union?
6991,j3djx8,What ended up happening is they represent corporate interests.  The senate might as well be elected by different special interests / business sectors like they do in Hong Kong.
6992,j3djx8,"I never said we live in a unrestricted democracy. We live in a republic that has always considered itself to be acting within the spirit of democracy, regardless of whether it was true or not."
6993,j3djx8,"A referendum for statehood or independence is on the ballot for PR this November. It’s non-binding because it’s up to congress to officially make that decision, but it hopefully it will make  PR’s intentions clear.

The last referendum was in favor of statehood, but the number of people who didnt vote outnumbered those who did 4:1 so it was inconclusive"
6994,j3djx8,"Senators are there to govern their territory not a mass of people wherever they may be.  You have to have State borders or there is no state.  Just because a state has a population different than that of another doesn't mean they should have a system any different than the others.  That's why there is an electoral vote. What do people who live in the city know about farming, mining, other ways of living and vise versa.  Without electoral those people have no voice and thus ignorance from the masses destroys the country."
6995,j3djx8,"You fix the electorial college with  repealing the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929.  No where does the constutution ever say the house should be capped and by a simple act of Congress, the populous states regain their weight in the electorial college."
6996,j3djx8,The Electoral College needs to go.
6997,j3djx8,"I can see your point. Personally I would much rather keep the electoral college and I have no serious issues with changing the number of senators from each state. Madison himself admitted that the reason for conceding to allow a 2 senator limit was simply to get through a deal for a formation of this nation. 

My question would be, what would be the point in having a Senate if we simply change it to having the same representation as the House?"
6998,j3djx8,You also realize California has like 58 reps though.
6999,j3djx8,"It’s not that intelligent. It’s literally part of elementary U.S. history. And it’s a disparity that no longer makes much sense if we want to call ourselves a democracy. We’ve had tyranny of the minority for too long here, and it’s getting worse."
7000,j3djx8,Yeah wasn't it supposed to STOP the ascent of TYRANTS?  Major fail there.  If they had ever had a moment to justify their existence.
7001,j3djx8,It solves no problems and creates plenty.
7002,j3djx8,"It’s the same theory as the senate votes, just not as extreme. It’s a system that allows a candidate to lose the popular vote by nearly 3,000,000 votes and still have a comfortable electoral college victory. All votes are not equal."
7003,j3djx8,"It's not too red but you can make several red states if you carve it up just right. Basically like you said, pack the big blue cities with two Dem senators, and give the sprawling inland two red Senators. What a gift to the GOP. Might as well invite them over to fuck your wife."
7004,j3djx8,"If you do it right you can get seven blue states. You basically gotta pair coastal areas with the inland areas.

7005,j3djx8,"Especially when it gets proposed by a CA billionaire who thinks he knows better.  Draper wanted to split CA into 6 and later after that push failed he tried to get people to split it into 2.  He completely ignores that as one huge economic powerhouse, CA has been one of the key entities ON EARTH able to push strong environmental protections and pull the rest of the planet towards greener solutions."
7006,j3djx8,Wasn't Trump trying to gut this legislative ability? It's probably something the GOP would love to end up at a 6-3 US Supreme Court.
7007,j3djx8,"What resources? What are you talking about? The state borders weren't set by some people looking at a map and saying  well that looks to big.

This is actually why the senate is needed. States collect their own taxes, set there own laws, have management of natural resouces... States do need a say in the federal government. The electoral college should be portioned by population or replaced with a direct vote. 

These state have almost no say in national politics. Giving up the senate means they have no say whatsoever. Seems extereme to me."
7008,j3djx8,"DC’s status as the federal seat just isn’t good enough for me to make 4 million people have no representation in congress, especially when 400,000 people, just by the nature of living elsewhere, get two senators and a rep."
7009,j3djx8,"Puerto Ricans voted against becoming a State in 1967, 1993 and 1998. In 2012 and 2017 they flat out refused to even bring it to a vote. The US isn't depriving them of anything."
7010,j3djx8,"You said 

> The Congress is supposed to represent the people. It's part of checks  and balances so New York and California don't make the laws for the rest  of the nation. 

And contradicted yourself. States are not people. And people do not divide their beliefs based on state lines."
7011,j3djx8,So you want two states to control the vote of the rest of the nation? And Democrats call Donny fascist
7012,j3djx8,Do you not know about the house if representatives? There is the senate 2 per state and the house which is based if population. So why would we need the senate to also be based on that?
7013,j3djx8,Man you seem like a pretty toxic individual

7017,j3djx8,"just spitballiing. Trying to think of something small states might ratify because you’d need 3/4 of states to amend the constitution. 

My idea is from the original composition of the house in the constitution is 65 for 13 states."
7018,j3djx8,"CA has 53 house seats and all of the highlighted seats have total of 51 in The House. You're talking about an imbalance and why CA should have more seats in the Senate because of the larger population? No... That's what The House is for...No state should have more power over another in the Senate. It's working as intended and with good reason.

&#x200B;

The House is elected directly by the people of the United States and representing public opinion.  The Senate is composed of senators, each represents a state in its entirety. Each state, regardless of population, is equally represented by two senators. 

&#x200B;

Adding more seats for CA in the senate would drastically tip the balance of power for CA. If CA wants to make its own laws that effect its own people go for it. I don't want CA unevenly controlling what goes on in my state half a continent away."
7019,j3djx8,"No you’re not less important. The senate is set up so each state gets represented at the federal level equally. Now how your state uses that representation is up to you and the rest of the residents of that state and if they’re not using it effectively then you need to elect new senators to rep you properly. Otherwise you would have these small pockets of the country running the whole thing (not small population size, just in area) instead of having a US government. It would just be the will of certain states being done for everyone. So big states like Cali, NY, Fl have the most reps so they can get a lot done in the House of Reps which is where laws are started. But once it goes to the senate it’s basically saying alright here’s what we want, what does everyone else think since it’s going to affect the whole country, and then the senate votes on it which seems fair to me. If the senate doesn’t pass it, the states that want it are still free to do stuff on their own through state legislatures and you in the big state that feels underrepresented nationally can still have the life you want without imposing on the rest of the states where a certain lifestyle or law isn’t as feasible. And it works both ways. Some lower population place like Montana should be set up differently because, for example, maybe they want less hunting restrictions or something because it’s a lot of outdoors type of people up there that hunt to eat  (I just made that up, I don’t know much abt. Montana) but Florida needs more restrictions because the high population would destroy all the wildlife if they had the freedoms Montana has. In this example either of them trying to get what’s best for them passed Federally would be bad for the other and it’s better that the whole country can vote on it equally vs One of them bullying the other into an undesirable and harmful situation just because they get more senators to pass laws."
7020,j3djx8,"Because if a small state feels like it has no voice in its government, why would it not want to leave and be its own country? We kinda want to continue to be one country. What's an entire race or age group supposed to do? That's why we care about location."
7021,j3djx8,"I see your point. But the intent of the structure was to be a collection of United States with their own basic sovereignty (territories defined by an area - not subgroups of people). The danger of distributing power based on race/ age/ religion/ income/ etc is that you are either in that group or not, and it also assumes that people within each group are more homogeneous than a group of people in a particular location. I may have misstated in my first comment, I don't think it was created to protect ""a minority"" (as in the characteristics listed), I think it was set up to protect everyone outside of the majority opinion. That way the rules cannot be written in a way that prevents them from changing. 

If the Constitution and laws were written to only favor, or even attempt to balance, based on those lines of division, we'd probably just end up with a white state, a black state, an Asian state, a wealthy state, a Hindu state etc. There would be no incentive to live together and govern together. We wouldn't end up being a collection of United States and instead be a bunch of warring territories with nothing in common but sharing a continent.

I think that the people of Colorado should have every bit of representation at thre federal level as the people of California, New York, or Texas. Otherwise, why live there? You wouldn't be able to have any say in how the USA conducts its foreign affairs or whether we even enforce our national borders. If governmental representation was distributed by race or religion, how far do you think we would have come in 240+ years? Outright ""majority rules"" is far more dangerous than representative democracy, and ours is a system that has demonstrated how much more effective it is to be represented by State than by just being one voice in a sea of 330 million.

The real power of the governmental structure we have is that if you think Wyoming is the state the ""is doing it correctly"" because the people there are aligned with your political, social, and/or economic philosophies, you don't have to fight so hard to change things where you are now, you can move there. That's honestly why we're seeing so many people leave New York and California right now. They're moving to places that are more in line with what they're looking for in their day-to-day lives. (Side note: the federal government shouldn't be our biggest concern. The Mayor of your city and your Governor have WAY MORE impact on what your daily life is like than whoever is in Congress or the White House. If more people understood that, and were active in their state and local government, everyone everywhere would generally be happier. The pandemic has outright proven that.)

What is a country if not a defined geographical area? A nation is a group of people. We can and should be both a place and a collective people.

I am by no means saying it's perfect. Of course there are modern conditions and concerns that could never have been anticipated. We were very nearly another monarchy. The reality is that, even with its flaws, this system was more than 200 years ahead if its time. I don't think an overhaul of the system that has worked generally so well for so long is the right move for now.

The US isn’t really divided into states anymore. It’s much more strongly divided into urban/rural, left/right, young/old, etc. That’s why a system that treats states as a meaningful division seems so arbitrary and unfair.

In the EU people broadly support giving a lot of power to the smaller states, because in Europe nations are still a meaningful division, in a way that US states simply aren’t."

People don't, however the Senate was intended to represent the States with small populations. It's so States like Wyoming still get a say in what happens in our country because the way they live is different than how people from New York live. Senators are supposed to represent their State in the government and pursue policies that benefit their State. However, Democrats and Republicans have changed that system. States used to appoint Senators but they changed it to a voting system because it would be easier to control the Senate that way. It's easier to fund a campaign than it is to control an entire state Government. In the Modern Senate, the parties can cut campaign funding for candidates that don't vote along party lines, that's why there is so little dissent. However previously senators didn't have to worry about campaign funding because their position was secure.

7075,j3djx8,"A few points: 

1. residents of DC, Puerto Rico, and all territories of the US have zero representation in either the House or the Senate. 

2. The principle of one-person, one-vote is absurdly violated by the incredible distortion of the Senate. If the state borders were Congressional Districts, they would clearly be struck down as unconstitutional. The same logic applies at the state legislature level. 

3. Compare U.S. states to the countries of the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each have a degree of autonomy through assemblies. But with the passage of the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, real power rest with the House of Commons which gives semi-proportional representation based on Periodic Reviews every 8-12 years (similar to redistricting done after a census every 10 years). The House of Lords is much older than the US Senate, and there is no reason that we could not choose to reform the role of the Senate in a similar manner in order to have a more representative federal legislature."

7077,j3djx8,"I dont think you understood my point. If you think it logically then the states rights argument does make sense. In Clausewitzian view war is extension of politics. The war started over the secession of the southern states, and there you have the question whether the states had a right to secede from the union. The EU and UK did not go to war over brexit.

The states rights argument is a valid one even though the sole reason for the south to argue it was to defend the institution of slavery and not out of some finer point in political philosophy. 

The south fought for the right to keep slaves but  north wasnt going to war over slavery. They went to war to stop the Union from falling apart. The ultimate reason for the war was the secession of the south and the question whether the states have the right to do so.

If there hadnt been a question over the states right to legislate slavery or to secede there wouldnt have been a war.

I am not defending the south or their cause at all but the main thing the war settled was the relationship between the states and the federal government. Abolition of slavery was just a side product although slavery was the main cause of schism between the federalist north and secessionist south. The slaves werent freed until 1863 when there was a credible threat of the British intervening on behalf of the south. Only then did the Union make the war officially about slavery"

Gerrymandering the red states, besides Texas or maybe Florida, would be harder, and hopefully we’d be able to block it with our new senate power.

Puerto Rico is basically a colony and it is funny how taxation without representation used to be a big iasue in the US back in the day

>But that’s an outdated idea.

It isn't. The states still have a variety of different needs. For example, water rights play a huge role in the politics of Western states.  Some go so far as to make it illegal to use a rain barrel to capture water running down your own downspout.  In the east and midwest? Not an issue at all. We've got more water than we know what to do with.  

A federal-level law on the issue of water rights could not possibly be fair in both the eastern and the western areas of the country. 


The Senate is what keeps the federal government from becoming Panem, the fictional nation in The Hunger Games. Panem is hardly a Democratic government: It disenfranchises the people of all the rural districts.  An effective Senate would restrict the power of the Capitol district, yes.  But in doing so, it also ensures the power of the people in the rural districts to establish and maintain self-governance.

7112,j3djx8,"I completely agree that it is about power, and no one will willingly give up power unless they have a strong self-interest in doing so.

There are some examples from US history:
- the emancipation proclamation freed enslaved persons in Confederate states. This helped advance Lincoln’s goal of preserving the Union by recruiting Black people in the South to help the Union cause. 
- the civil rights acts of 1964 and voting rights acts of 1965 were passed after massive public pressure erupted after watching police brutality in the South."

To get back to 270 is possible but would take decades and need lean blue / likely blue states like OR, CT, DE, NJ, NV to turn red.  

The popular vote gap isn't as big and would be easier to close if they reform, offer more populist policies and expand their base eg. latinos and working class.  Moderate conservative parties are generally doing well in western Europe which is usually less right leaning.

Even when factoring in independents, Democrats still have a healthy lead over Republicans, and that lead is only growing every year as the younger generation reaches voting age... and every generation leans a bit further left or stagnates, but almost never returns to the right. It's a trend that's happening all over the Western world, especially in Europe. I study electoral trends among voters, esp.

The NSA then could lie, but at least Trump could ask. He has done nothing of the sort.

If we can’t talk about stuff with the opposing side we become just as closed in as the people we dislike.

Because there are laws that ban people on Interpol's most wanted list from entering the US, Trump would have to break those laws, to do anything.

There are many countries that don't allow dual citizenship. I was under the mistaken impression that the UK was one of them, as I've never wanted to become a British citizen, I've never need to confirm that.

7391,6tbo3z,"Are you helping contribute to keeping equal rights from people due to your perception of their genetics or geographical background?  Overtly through direct actions (or support of those who attempt such actions) or covertly through continuance of cultural biases?

We have to make decisions about intent and effect, eventually - I don't generally go for ""one size fits all.""

If your old, frail grandfather wears the red hat because - in part - he implicitly thinks it'll keep non-white people in a place of assumed, societal power, I wouldn't call him a Nazi or alt-right supporter, immediately.  I had a grandmother from rural Kentucky who once happily informed me that they called black people ""n*ggers,"" thinking that she was being helpful in that context of an otherwise light conversation - she was implicitly racist from her upbringing, yet didn't harbor hatred or act upon that racism in her daily life, oddly enough - they voted Democratic in the 60s and 70s, too.

So, even if your frail grandfather was unwittingly perpetuating a set of decades-old biases which happen to feed into part of what the alt-right is tapping into that makes them feel emboldened and supported, from the top->down, I still wouldn't see him as the core problem here: he's probably not aware of what implicit bias is, in such a case, and how it can affect others from his perspective.  And, at this point in his life, maybe it doesn't really make much sense to try and help him to see more sides and determine if that really means anything significant to him, frankly - he's may be just trying to live day-to-day at best,I suspect.

And, he may have simply identified with the hoo-rah stuff Trump lied about on the campaign trail and all - dog-whistling or not.  I fail to see any explicit or even implicit attempt to keep other people from having equal rights and opportunities to folks like himself, in that case.

All Trump voters collectively supported a machine which has a horrible, overall emphasis of racial and cultural biases to distract from the power grab by a wealthy demographic minority, but not all Trump voters realized that they were supporting the worst aspects of societal biases in the process, I realize.

Loosely knit movements like BLM work to smack the idea of societal bias directly on the head, in relatively uncompromising fashion: whether you like those tactics or not, they are forcing many people to react and even to think about what's been going on since black people were brought to this area as slaves.  They want people to recognize the operating imbalance of recognition and even in-practice rights that black people still face, on a whole, in the USA today . . . so that something practical could eventually be done about that situation, either through cultural redirections or more formal programs/policies to address the lopsided rights attainments perceived."

In my opinion, just being an abolitionist isn't some litmus test for your greatness, as I think it depends on the totality of circumstances. Aaron Burr was an abolitionist, but he also murdered Alexander Hamilton and allegedly was going to go behind Jefferson's back to establish his own, neighboring country in the current-Southwest US, which could have invited more conflict with US-prime. Washington didn't work to free slaves, but he made a load of other important decisions for the US that I'm forever grateful for. "
7403,6tbo3z,"Congress was also forbidden by the constitution to deal with slavery until 1808, 12 years after Washington resigned and 8 after he died (I think), for precisely this reason. "
7404,6tbo3z,"If he had pissed off the South at that point, there would be no America. It was very contentious, and took a lot of work to get the Constitution ratified.

There's a point at the end of 1175 where Washington paid some of his troops from his own personal finances, which wouldn't have existed without his plantation, which would have killed our revolution sooner and thusly no America would be born. 
I'm not trying to justify slavery, just the moral dilemma that was faced by our founding fathers at the time. As human rights have progressed, it's easy to be high and mighty, but go back a few hundred years- would it be as easy if you knew the alternative was homelessness and starvation, sickness and death for your family?

So more often than not that behavior is avoided. The beliefs are merely reconciling ones owns lot. Whether that is a healthy outlet or one that blames a group of people (regardless of race, gender, or political affiliation)."
7427,6tbo3z,At that rally yes. I'm referring to the witch hunt of anyone associated with the right being called Nazi's.
7428,6tbo3z,"That's my biggest issue with everything going on. The left and the right aren't doing anything to help they're just furthering the distance between the two parties and alienating more and more people every day. 63 million people voted for Trump. Yeah some of those are Nazis. Some of BLM was calling for the murder of police. Each side has really shitty people. We need to focus on the shitty people and not lumping in everybody else at the same time.

I get fucking murdered in comment sections just for trying to say that."
7429,6tbo3z,I think the point is cases like your grandfather's are not the subject at hand.
7430,6tbo3z,Does he disavow the alt right and think they shouldn't be catered too? Why does he support Trump?
7431,6tbo3z,[deleted]
7432,6tbo3z,"Sorry if the length is intimidating or otherwise confusing, but I obviously said nothing of the kind.

You gave no other context for your grandfather other than ""frail,"" so I put him into various potential buckets as an exercise, none of which admonished his decision to wear such a hat.

If you added, ""and, he's been a KKK member for 40 years,"" then I might have another opinion.

Your use of the label of ""wrong-think"" seems to reveal a proactively defensive grievance, as well."
7433,6tbo3z,"There is no approach with a more consistent (even if not perfectly so) than operant conditioning. Eventually, the dam breaks. The question is whether you have the willpower to wait it out."
7434,6tbo3z,"Hey man, for some reason we can't access r/BlueMidterm2018. It says that the subreddit has been either deleted or turned private. Maybe I did something to break the rules and get banned, or maybe I hit the unsubscribe button by accident. For some reason it won't let us in.

Edit: figured out the issue! It would help to link to the right subreddit lol. My mistake."

7437,6tbo3z,"While I see what you're saying, I do think we can go back even further and act ""high and mighty"" to those who chose to bring people over to America to endure a life of slavery in the first place..."
7438,6tbo3z,"I don't think saying ""He wasn't an abolitionist"" is degrading. "
7439,6tbo3z,"That's nice.  How childish of me to think that one of the richest slaveowners in the country could have maybe done more to stop the 100 years of brutal slavery and eugenics that followed them. 

>You deal in absolutes like a child.

Thanks for my daily dose of irony."
7440,6tbo3z,You mean 18th?
7441,6tbo3z,The Right? Of course not. The alt-right? Not so sure about that.
7442,6tbo3z,"This is exactly what I'm trying to get at.

If someone from r/Turd_Dumpling tries to claim that all muslims are terrorists they will be summsrily and correctly labeled as hsteful crazy people, yet; if you have a red hat on, you obviously want the nazi party to reign in america.

The cognitive dissonance is astounding."
7443,6tbo3z,"Right, he's just a rounding error when people start to have their rights taken away. I get ya."
7444,6tbo3z,Can you find that out by looking at the hat he's wearing?
7445,6tbo3z,"Really? I'm pretty sure my grand dad want's to make america great again. He doesn't have a singln social media account. He can't describe what the ""alt-right"" even is, and yet you say his hat is 100% proof that he supports them? Facinating. Where was that rule written? On a CNN bulletin somewsere?"
7446,6tbo3z,"My grievance is only with the fascist and prejudicial tactics used to divide a populous. Be it the hateful racists of the far right, or the entitled bigots of the far left.

You need ironclad reasons to take a person's liberty away, and starting off with castigating a group of people by their atire is a very poor first step."

7452,6tbo3z,"Ok, let's pretend reality doesn't exist. You people."
7453,6tbo3z,"Yeah man, it's really hard because the far left and right shine through like the fucking sun and it's impossible to shut them up.

I would consider myself liberal, I voted liberal in the last Canadian election, but I have some conservative views and it sucks to be lumped in as a Nazi when I try and tell people on Reddit that. I just think that if each side were actually as intellectual as they think they are they wouldn't be lumping everybody in; they would be working towards compromises."
7454,6tbo3z,"He's basically Italy, not Nazis, but Nazi adjacent so he's gunna get swept up in that sometimes."
7455,6tbo3z,you don't have to know what the alt right is to have the same beliefs as them.
7456,6tbo3z,"Well, I would generally agree about trying not to decide on a book solely by its cover - especially since I didn't bring that up in the first place within this thread."
7457,6tbo3z,How long ago was that? About 20 minutes?
7458,6tbo3z,That's the past man. Three straight cycles of blue make me feel pretty confident that things have changed
7459,6tbo3z,Not sure what you're getting at here...
7460,6tbo3z,"Same boat here. I completely agree. We have far more in common than with have misaligned, but trying to convince the gnostic of that is sisyphean."
7461,6tbo3z,Right. So public hangings are all good then.
7462,6tbo3z,"So now you're saying you can determin my grandfather's actual belief structure from the hat he wears? Facinating.

"
7463,6tbo3z,"""seems intent..."" is exactly the cover-judging quote of yours that I was pointing out.

What qualifies as seeming to have an intent to cause harm to another? Does wearing a MAGA hat qualify, in your world-view?"
7464,6tbo3z,"When I made my first comment, about two hours ago.

Back on desktop. Sub is back to normal"
7465,6tbo3z,"> That's the past man.

Good lord... That was literally the entire point of my post... Let me see if I can clear this up more for you.

For the past 52 years, Virginia has been Red. For the past 9 it's been blue. Which number is larger? I'll give you a hint. Virginia votes red __more than 80% of the time__ and your position is that literally none of that matters because the past 9 years it's been blue?

If that's your logic then I don't even know how to respond to that--it's just about the dumbest damn thing I've ever heard."
7466,6tbo3z,I understood some of those words
7467,6tbo3z,Well that escalated quickly. I said nothing of the sort sir
7468,6tbo3z,"yes, that hat speaks very loudly to his beliefs."
7469,6tbo3z,"Maybe he's just too dumb or uninformed to understand what ""wearing that hat"" fully entails?

It was no secret during the campaign what a vapid and horrible candidate trump was. He offered no real policy positions beyond build the wall and make America great again. That's it. No solid plans, no foundation on which to build. Just secret plans about sneak attacks that the generals were too dumb to figure out themselves. Suckers swallowed his BS hook, line, and sinker

Thanks to grampa's vote, look where we are. On the brink of war with North Korea, and maybe China if trump makes the first move. Alienation with, if not outright hostility toward, many of our traditional allies. We have collusion with hostile foreign powers in the highest office. We have literal nazis sitting to the left and right  (Gorka & Bannon) of trump, feeding him advice on how to deal with the ""non existent, probably false flag, nazi so called problem"".
"
7470,6tbo3z,"A fuller context:

"". . .  seems intent on harming others - socially, emotionally or physically - . . .""

I was talking about people who are appearing to go out of their way to cause someone else (unfair) distress.  Not someone wearing a silly hat with no context at all."
7471,6tbo3z,"If say historically it's a red state, but I wouldn't feel right calling it a red state when clearly in this current state and time, theres been a ahift politically in Virginia. It is blue, has been blue for 9 years. 

Also 52 is 477% larger than 9.  When you lack basic math skills I have trouble trusting your political views "

I did find this candidate on twitter, Dave, who agrees we me on everything.  So I'm going to vote 3rd party, and I'm sure they'll all get the message that way.

Again, not defending trump. He’s a buffoon and totally unqualified to be POTUS. But he ain’t going anywhere. Sometimes you just gotta realize you’re not accomplishing anything. 

It just seems childish at this point. I understand why all the satire subreddits have some variation of “orange man=bad” jokes. That’s all you do here! Sit around and say orange man bad. If you’re trying to gain more supporters for your cause, I can attest personally that’s it not working! All it does is make me mistrust democrats’ competency just as much as I mistrust republicans’ competency. It just looks like bitchy squabbling.

Even if Dems take back the house and the senate they won't have the votes to actually get him out of office.   Their options are impeach and lose, which won't look good and is likely to be very bad for 2020 or let him ride it out and keep alienating everyone who doesn't have their head shoved up Fox News' ass.

At this point the only way I think he's out before 2020 is if Murdoch turns on him or if he resigns.  The first might happen but I don't think the second is going to.

With that said a blue wave in 2018 will at least limit Trump's power to repetitively take hot steaming turds all over the US.  Get the fuck out and vote people."

7632,8zdv8e,"I'm curious what you think is going to stop him. Many legal experts agree that a sitting President cannot be indicted, so even if Mueller brings down everybody else he almost certainly cant touch Trump while Trump is in office.

Which brings us to impeachment, which will absolutely never happen. There ain't a snowball's chance in hell that Trump will be removed from office by the legislature, mo matter what happens in the fall.

Because it's honestly just so damn tiring to constantly see the left judge him by his words (which are incoherently stupid about 95% of the time) versus his actions/policy decisions which have actually been pretty good for the country so far.


What he does versus what he says are completely different so often it's hard to take any of this seriously until we see what comes of it."
7660,8zdv8e,"Part of it is conspiracy thinking. If you ever engage with people on the right (I do every day), one common link is that upon encountering new information, they always twist it or dismiss it. 

Russia hacked DNC 
“Why did the dnc leave themselves open”
Or “Hillary lost, get over it, fake news”

Everything is part of the ‘liberal’s plot’ to enlighten them, or it’s just more self-serving information to reinforce biases. 

All of the news and horrible actions of the president are either spun or ignored. 

The president said “take away guns without questions” and they said “he didn’t mean it”. It’s just pure bias reinforcement without considering that he really doesn’t care about the constitution. "
7661,8zdv8e,">How in the fuck is this happening? 

I've thought about this a lot the past couple years. After seeing all the machinations of the system responding to the treason, after seeing the overwhelming evidence of Russian intrusion, and after seeing the ensuing prompt explosion of our barely-contained xenophobic rage... I think we did this, and it accurately represents the populace.

I think that if the Russia hadn't done shit we still would have elected Trump, and we will as a nation continue to support his horrific policies, because we are a bad nation. We are a racist, hypercapitalist, *just plain douchebag* nation."

7666,8zdv8e,"I am curious what about Helsinki makes it a failure? Or I should say, why do you see it as such?

> The people need to be critical of their representatives otherwise mistakes will keep happening. 

I suppose the disconnect is that what some people consider the most horrible of mistakes, other people see as an excellent turn of events.

My awareness of what it is that Russia is believed to have done, or actors within Russia are believed to have done, amounts to some social engineering (on a truly tiny scale, compared to what you see Facebook, Youtube, and Google do with their curated search results and curated stories). 

As to the hacking of the DNC and the like, the House Intelligence report from April? May? covers much of the same information as the most recent Meuller indictments, but additionally points out that efforts were made to hack and retrieve information from Republican computer systems as well.

All that being said, I don't understand the need to become absolutely rabid with regards to Russia, beating the war drums, demanding the most crushing of sanctions. To what end? What does this accomplish?

"
7667,8zdv8e,Also because Hillary wasn't a good candidate.

7670,8zdv8e,"The yokels that voted him in are responsible, they own this shit.  "
7671,8zdv8e,"But to say the Dem lost because they didn’t earn enough votes is incorrect. The drumpf campaign was strategic- earning the EC votes in the 3 swing states that mattered - because of the 3rd party votes cast in those specific states. 

Like,he “won” by gaming the system - NOT because our message doesn’t resonate. In righty wing Mississippi, Dems swept a town’s city council. Dems are winning in special elections up & down the ballot, running & winning in previously uncontested places. 

Yes there is something to the angry right wing that got behind this guy but we cannot change those minds & shouldn’t become hateful trying to get their votes. 

We need to reach the normally absent citizen & get more people to vote. "
7672,8zdv8e,That’s not true. Bush 43 won in 2004 with 50.7% of the vote.
7673,8zdv8e,"Ah so I’m a loser, a victim & don’t understand 
Nice productive conversation "
7674,8zdv8e,"Amen. All we need is one house and Trump will have to work with dems to get anything done. And he won't be able to stack the court anymore either.

#Get the fuck out and vote people."
7675,8zdv8e,"Yes of course he's going to last until 2020. Lawyer-ing and suing and all that shit takes LITERALLY FOREVER to finish, I swear Trump will lose re-election in 2020, and then go on with his life, and grow even older, and DIE a free man. Justice will never come for him. If you have enough money you can stall the courts forever."
7676,8zdv8e,"Of course it’s still critically important to get out there and vote. 

In November, in local and regional elections, and in 2020 against whomever the shambles of the Republican Party puts forward to replace Trump..."
7677,8zdv8e,"And many other legal experts believe that a sitting President can be indicted. 

It’s supposed to be extremely difficult, but this is a historically unprecedented situation that will challenge the rules and norms for decades to come. 

Trump is dirty. 

He knows it, Putin’s knows it, the GOP knows it (because they’re dirty too), and every intelligence agency worldwide knows it.

Until then, it is best to wait and be patient. 

Getting inside of our mind and our emotions will be the downfall. We have to stay present and stay informed. We do not have to be emotional about these situations.

An indictment is not a guilty verdict, (and in truth a guilty verdict does not mean a thing was  actually done, but for the purposes of meaningful conversation we can and should ignore that), however for what it’s worth, with the scrutiny the FBI is under, and the general restraint they’ve shown thus far, I’m inclined to believe they would not release indictments without being very convinced and having a very strong case. That said, I’m not sure yet either, less so because I do not really follow the news as much as I should.

I’ll be honest, I’ve ejected any knowledge of Hillary about my brain and have exactly zero interest in her. She is not the president of the United States. If she’s found to be a criminal, throw her in jail, sure. Hillary is completely besides the point: who would be worse/who’s a worse criminal is a useful conversation during the pathetic mess that is the lead up to voting, and potentially entertaining in retrospect once a new president has been elected, but in the here and now when the president is constantly being perceived to be committing serious crimes, that is the topic at hand, and is the topic that needs pursued. In short, we can’t do anything about Hillary and her crimes, actual or fictional. We can have a conversation to convince others that President Trump is a bad man, and that we should strip him of power how we can, which is to vote both intelligently and against his party, to at least slow down his insanity. Pointing to Hillary and saying “BUT THE EMAILS” is not a defense against accusations leveled at the president, because the president is not Hillary. It’s deflection, plain and simple.

While one can condemn many presidents, not least of which was Obama for committing arguable acts of war against many other countries, that’s a completely different issue. While there is frustration and outrage that the Russians attempted to mess with out elections, that is not people’s issue. Of course Russia would attempt to do that; it’s Russia. Russians don’t give a hoot what other Russians think, much less the rest of the world. What people are up in arms about is the accusations of collusion between Americans, potentially Americans within the Trump Campaign to mess with the campaign. Why his answer is considered a problem is because the FBI is saying that Russia intentionally interferes with the election, and President Trump was asked if he believed in his organizations, and he said “well Hillary is bad, and Putin (a man I will note is widely believed worldwide and within his own country to rig his own elections and just generally do awful things) said he didn’t do it so, *eh* I guess he didn’t do it!” That’s the issue. Siding with Putin against the FBI. Sidestepping the question would have been criticized, but he explicitly showed disregard for the professional allegations from his administrations FBI.

Now I’ll grant that maybe he is some kind of Superman that has some grand plan for the future, and that it really is just him trying to smooth relations with Russia. Russia is a difficult beast to tackle. Russia does whatever it wants, if it thinks it can get away with it, and out and out war isn’t really an option for either side. America is far from innocent in the world, but things should be rocky with Russia given their actions in recent history."
7739,8zdv8e,"LOL that was nothing but pure bullshit and whataboutism. Stop with the russian talking points and start acting like an american (assuming you really are one).  Russian intelligence agents hacked multiple political organizations and state election systems, an act of cyber war on our country and the president sides with the attacker over our own intelligence services and fbi- its utterly fucking ridiculous that anyone can excuse this behavior.

Also, I think it’s cathartic for people to just bitch and complain with like minded people. Nothing wrong there, in my mind, on both sides.

7748,8zdv8e,"1. His loosening of the military's ROE and his tougher stance against ISIS that has led to their near-eradication.
2. His tougher stance on Iran and backing from what was a crap deal.
3. His loosening of unnecessary regulations and pursuit of policies that put more money back into businesses, which has led to almost 4% GDP growth in 2017 as well as terrific unemployment statistics.
4. Declaring Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
5. The opening up of public lands in the western side of the U.S. Especially for economic opportunities such as drilling.
6. North Korean sanctions.
7. His repeal of the individual mandate.
8. Pulout from the Paris Accords.
9. Tax Reform.
10. The travel ban.

\---------------------------------------------

1. ISIS has been smashed foer over 3 years now
2. With no deal in place  Iran can start enriching uranium TOMORROW without limit. And it can limit the most intrusive inspections because there IS no deal.
3. He loosened regulations that concerned consumer protection.  You actually think that's a good idea? Fool.    He also got rid of mostly environmental regulations like those that stopped coal companies from dumping rocks and other debris created by mountain top removal mining into nearby streams.  Prior to that specific regulation the Natural Resources Defense Council discovered that mountain-top removal mining, in which ground is blasted to access coal seams below, has been responsible for the destruction of 2,000 miles of streams in Appalachia.   Fuck clean water I guess.  Companies will always do the right thing when it comes to deciding between profits and our health and environment.  He did these things in 2017.  There is NO WAY they would immediately manifest in  2017's GDP.  He did nothing in 2016... so the success of 2017 is due to policies that were already in place. I'll leave it at that.
4. Yeah... That helps who?
5. So, he gutted environmental protections and renewable energy incentives and opened up drilling opportunities...  Once again how dumb are you.  Fuck the water and land, just get that sweet oil at any cost, right?
6. OK, tell me one thing thing he talked North Korea into doing?
7. Once again, not joining the world in renewable energy study and pollution reduction.  You think this is a good thing?  Do you work for an oil company?

8)Travel Ban. Has stopped what?

9)Tax cuts for the 1% which has seen exponential income growth over the past 20 years while the middle class has remained stagnant or worse when factored with the rise in the cost of living.  A tax cut virtually every economics professional says will destroy the economy. Show me one example where supply-side economices based on tax cuts for the wealthy and businesses was successful.  Because Kansas would love to know. They did it and they've been BROKE for years now ($350m deficit in the first fiscal year after the cut then nearly an additional $600m in the next).  They can't even afford A/C in some government buildings.  This was the pure model of trickle-down running, no lefties involved.

Lets see how things are going in the fall of 2019 when all of Trumps work over the past year is fully in play.  Look me up and we'll talk."

I'm a democrat, but I'm fiscally conservative. I think you can have a social conscience and still be reasonable about how much money you throw at social programs. I believe we need to get all these wars under control so some of that money that is going to the military can be used for social programs. I'm called ""unpatriotic"" for that, but I don't think it is. Afghanistan is the younger generation's Viet Nam. It's never going to be over, and if Trump has his way, he will reinstitute the draft.

Obviously, people who actually believe in limited government spending would be in favor of cutting the military along with every other form of spending, but with people who tend to make these statements it is (usually) more that they hate ""wasteful"" arts/welfare/education/whatever else that is actually a much smaller portion of the budget than non-discretionary or military spending."

Every year after the deficit went back down, I guess it is also his fault that he was handed 2 wars and a failing economy. After he spent 8 years and got us out of the wars and helped the economy with steady job growth the country decided to hand it back over to the political party which fucked it up hard.

Which now we are going back to trickle down economics which hasn't worked since the 70s and while we are at it lets get back into a few wars which have no end. Let us promise to ""bring jobs back"" but never do it, let us ""build a wall"" while illegal immigrant numbers have went down since 2006 (Mexicans are no longer coming here).

To me, being fiscally conservative means that you want the biggest bang for your buck, and that you only want to help those who really need it, which means putting some money into enforcement. The IRS fraud agents used to actually bring in more money than it cost to run the unit, but somehow, the Republicans thought that was bad so they slashed their budget. That's not being fiscally conservative, that's being fiscally irresponsible. You know why they did it? Because the people they were investigating and forcing to pay were all rich people. They once said that they never looked at people who made normal wages. I think their cutoff was $100,000 a year (which isn't much in today's economy, although I'd take it). They didn't prosecute little people. They just noted their files. 

To shut something down that is actually making you money is just stupid."

If we could save money overall, then each eligible person could get more, and we could have more outreach programs to get those who don't know they are eligible onto programs. 

It doesn't mean giving people less, it means giving the ones who need it most more. For example, there are so many seniors who don't know they are eligible for food stamps, and wouldn't know how to apply if they did, so they do without when they really need them. A lot of people have no clue how to get into subsidized housing, so they struggle with rent, sometimes not eating so they can have a place to live. There are also rent assistance programs that people don't know about.

Fiscal conservatives want to put money where it will do the most good, not throw it away on bullshit stuff that doesn't move the country forward. We can't move forward if we leave the needy behind.

He ran on reducing the deficit, but go back and look at what happened. It increased massively. Then there was selling weapons to Iran, so he could bypass Congress. Add to that everyone in the administration forgetting if they said things and I suspected that they really weren't honest people. I voted for Bush the first because I couldn't vote for the liberal Dukakis. No other reasons. I wasn't happy with George Bush but I couldn't vote for someone liberal. The economy did ok, if you were already rich, but not if you weren't. And that great Republican issue, the deficit, was still growing by leaps and bounds. I still voted Bush in 92, for the same reasons I did in 88, but with dwindling enthusiasm. In 96 I voted for Clinton. I can't say that things turned around but they did get better, even for some middle class and poor people. When the Gingrich led the campaign to impeach Clinton, for having sex with an aide (which I believe he is guilty of and I had flashbacks to Reagan here) and it was already common knowledge that Gingrich was a twice divorced man who told his second wife he was divorcing her while she in the hospital for cancer treatments, and marrying someone he had been having an affair with for a while, I couldn't accept his 'family values ' statement with any degree of belief. It turned out that 2 or 3 Republicans were having affairs at the time they were voting to impeach Clinton of the same thing. And when it was eventually pointed out they said it wasn't the same as what Clinton did. 

At the end of his term the loss of income that the middle class had suffered since Reagan had leveled off, though not gone back up, but the deficit was actually going down, and if it stayed on the path it was on might be gone in 10 years. 

Then Jr was elected, the deficit shot back up again,and real middle class ( and poorer) people started doing worse again. With control of the Presidency and Congress there was no real attempt at balancing the budget. 

Until Obama got elected. Then the budget was suddenly important again, as was his religion. Remember, at first, Obama wasn't a Muslim but a disciple of a radical leftist Christian minister. 

And so on. Like I said, it wasn't an epiphany but a lot of compounded hypocrisy.

Seems like anything that can be, will be and is being used to divide people. Hopefully we can make it through whatever length of time is left in Trumps term."
8083,6v859r,"That's the problem. How do you measure well-being? You can invest in food programs and financial aid programs, but you won't see the results in pure dollar amounts. Happiness and employment are somewhat obscure metrics that Republicans fucking hate. You could be doing the poor a huge service and Republicans will complain about welfare queens. "

8091,6v859r,How about conservatives who aren't racists abandoning the Republican party en masse and starting a new party?
8092,6v859r,"I didn't say anything about well being.  But if you want a program to help someone, I just want to know that it's going to be done in a way that ensures the bills get paid for it.  Ideally, you'd have something like food stamps tied to employment training and put those people back into the workforce where they contribute to paying for the program.

At this point, motherfuck Republicans.  I'm trying to be a grown up but I want to give away their money to the worst addicts around just to piss them off.  They need a leader that will grab them by their scruffs and drag them back into the light.

TR would gut every last one of these fucks.  We need a god damned asteroid for all these ""Republican"" dinosaurs on the radio and TV.  All those people are ruining half the country for a buck.  Ruin them all."
8093,6v859r,"Well, conservatives would say they don't want the government to have all the power to control us, just the power to defend us. 

They'd advocate for a decentralized government and only just enough legal authority to make sure foreign invasions aren't successful.

And maybe if we drop enough cash on PR, they will instantly have food and electricity?  Maybe enough cash will smother the California fires?  Money alone doesn't solve every problem.  They need more leadership.  Like sending more military aid.  Like helping connect people to resolve these issues quicker.  Maybe the president should do his job and help push for legislation that would do something now, rather than go golfing while congress works out an aid package for insurance claims?

> I do t understand why people ar saying we aren’t do anything.

Because TRUMP is doing nothing.  There is not enough leadership from the federal government to support PR and California.  Maybe Trump should be driving legislation to prevent these problems?  Maybe Trump should be rallying OUR nation together to help our fellow citizens instead of blaming them and attacking people who disagree with him?  Maybe Trump should be doing ANYTHING?

Trump is in fact doing less than nothing.  He is threatening PR in multiple ways.  Does jack shit on his photo op tour of PR.  Hasn't said really anything meaningful on California.

Fake news?  You have 600 posts on the_donald.  That place is a fucking factory of fake news.  You are the problem.  Your sub is the problem.  The person you helped elect to the presidency regularly pushed fake news, gives press credentials to literal fake news, retweets fake news, and is generally the King of fake fucking news.  Don't come here and stand on a platform of ""we need to kill fake news""

And no, disrespecting our country is not a problem that needs to be dealt with now.  And kneeling during the anthem isn't disrespecting our country, since the biggest part of our country isn't some bullshit piece of cotton, it's the fucking goddamn right to protestr this country and make it what you want.  Its so incredibly tone deaf to suggest that the only thing that matters here is when someone chooses to protest in a way that you don't like.  Protesting is the most important AMERICAN right.

> Russian propagandas main goal since the 60s have been to create political divisides in our country

Says the person defending a president who divides this country further at every turn.  The president who didn't know he was the president of PR.  The president who threatened to cut off aid for PR during a crisis.  The president of a party that refused to let PR restructure their debt like any other state.

What bull shit.

> By attacking the fake news media he is trying to bring America back together

WHAT?  You can't honestly be serious...  All of his press secretaries lie pretty much constantly.  He gives time to Breitbart and Infowars.  He retweets lies and conspiracy.  HE FUCKING WENT ON A WITCHHUNT FOR YEARS CLAIMING OUR PRESIDENT WAS A FOREIGN BORN MUSLIM.

Wow. 

It's all my fault. 


"
8315,76l1hc,"Well, that was just too easy. Wildfires in California? Yeah, every year. Like ten every year. Mostly manageable, but occasionally devastating. I regard it as a State's issue though, being that the State deals with it with such high frequency that they should be experts on the matter. And California is pretty good about wildfires. Still a bit of disconnect between two organizations. One trying to stamp out each and every fire, the other intentionally letting fires burn and saying, ""No, let it burn up all the deadwood and only stop it if it threatens lives. If you stop every wildfire then we'll get a massive one that we can't stop and it will kill people.""

I'll let you guess which school of thought brought about the massive destruction of property seen recently. Okay, no I won't. It's from the people who think every single fire needs to be extinguished instead of nature running its natural course. So instead of putting resources where we need them, when we need them, we have them fighting an un-fightable fire that they themselves built. Pretty fucking unreal that we could have two competing schools of thought on a matter that had about a century of experience on. One being right and the other being catastrophically wrong. But hey, it sort of mimics our political system. One side saying ""We can do something so we should do something!"" The other saying, ""No. don't do shit. It has worked for basically the entirety of human history."""

8331,76l1hc,"Tbh, I live in northern California and my mom's house was a few miles away from two of the fires. I've been following the news daily and I've heard the president talk about the NFL more than I have the CA fires. 

Maybe that's because most of the news I'm watching is directly related to the damage caused and the safety of residents and not the political aspects of it that I haven't seen his response. 

I just know that with every other president in my lifetime I recall an incredible effort to show empathy for those dealing with the disaster, both Democrats and Republicans. This is the only president where I'm not seeing that unification. And that's all my experience and perspective as someone who has a personal connection to the tragedy. "

At this point, anyone who voluntarily lives in a hurricane prone area, under sea level, etc., is basically just pissing into the wind when it comes time to ask for help. 

So, FALSE. Everyone should plan for the future. And no one is oblivious to the natural phenomena in the area they live.

That's why it dropped; not because he did something profound, but because the 2008 deficit was incredibly high.

We shouldn't pretend that Bill was some kind of economic genius, or that Obama somehow navigated the economy with incredible expertise. Bill caused the crash and Bush signed a large amount of the paperwork that helped fix it. Obama's follow-ups mostly applied basic keynesian economics.

Not that I'm criticizing him for applying keynesian economic theory but it's silly to pretend he was particularly genius for doing so. Econ 101 is not praiseworthy. Navigating complex foreign policy or taking a strong, proven stance on new issues is praiseworthy."

8518,7pa5r3,Because it did.  
8519,7pa5r3,"Dubya's fault, and Obama never ran a deficit as big as any of Dubya's.  
Actually Obama should be _blamed_ for that because the economy needed more stimulus than was actually implemented, and the amount he proposed, $750 billion, was based on the initial GDP numbers for the end of 2008, not the actual numbers, which showed that the economy had shrunk almost twice as fast as initially thought.  In other words the stimulus should have been $1.5 trillion. That's not to say the Republican Congress can be excused because they fought against good ideas like infrastructure spending (could have been so cheap when unemployment was at 10%) and Obama's jobs program.  
 
Most people don't realize how bad the economy was when Clinton came to office, but the nation's largest bank, CitiCorp, was only a few days from being declared insolvent, and it looked like the national debt was out of control, thanks to Reagan's voodoo supply-side economics.  Clinton essentially reversed Reagan's economic policies, not only by implementing austerity but also by raising taxes, which Republicans predicted would cause economic armageddon, and no Republicans voted for it (but years later they took credit).  If anything, Clinton's economic policies were like Republican Eisenhower's (the last Republican to run a budget surplus), and  not only there was a budget surplus in each year of Clinton's second term, but there were predictions that the national debt would be completely paid off in the 2030s, later moved up to 2015 in his last year in office.  Actually that wasn't miraculous or radical but just the norm under normal economic policies.  In peacetime, the federal government normally tends toward surpluses and needs occasional tax cuts to prevent excessive surpluses, and it takes true incompetence to cause a deficit problem.  "
8520,7pa5r3,Nope
8521,7pa5r3,"Credit to where credit is due. It was first American people, second it was “the contract with America” and third it was Clinton. In the nineties American people were tired of large government, and gave Democrats huge losses in Congress. To Clinton’s credit he totally listened to the American people did not like the era of big government. The new Congress was elected to do the “contract with America” which was the first time balanced the budget. And that congress passed the bill, and Clinton signed it. "

8523,7pa5r3,"That's factually incorrect. Clinton got rid of the gutted and totally toothless Glass-Steagal act, which was rendered useless by previous degregualtion that started in the 70s.  None of what he got rid of would've prevented the financial disaster.

Deficit is the amount by which the debt is increasing annually. When Bush took office, we actually had a surplus, meaning the debt was decreasing. When Bush left office, we had a massive deficit, meaning the debt was increasing by a huge amount every year.

It's not possible to just erase the deficit overnight, so because Obama was handed a deficit, we continued to take on debt. However, by the time he left office, we were taking on far less debt than when he took it."

Nothing he got rid of would've stopped the housing/financial crisis.  


Glass-Steagall was already gutted before Clinton took office. . Reagan and Bush 1 are the main culprits. How Democrats blame a Democrat for a Republican failure is beyond me, but Republicans are laughing their asses off about it.

The rest of this is straight from the source, I'm too lazy to format it all, tho


>1980s and 1990s bank product developmentsEdit

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as Congress considered whether to “repeal” Glass–Steagall, commercial banks and their affiliates engaged in activities that commentators later linked to the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[114]

Securitization, CDOs, and “subprime” creditEdit

In 1978 Bank of America issued the first residential mortgage-backed security that securitized residential mortgages not guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise (“private label RMBS”).[20] Also in 1978, the OCC approved a national bank, such as Bank of America, issuing pass-through certificates representing interests in residential mortgages and distributing such mortgage-backed securities to investors in a private placement.[37] In 1987 the OCC ruled that Security Pacific Bank could “sell” assets through “securitizations” that transferred “cash flows” from those assets to investors and also distribute in a registered public offering the residential mortgage-backed securities issued in the securitization.[115]This permitted commercial banks to acquire assets for “sale” through securitizations under what later became termed the “originate to distribute” model of banking.[116]

The OCC ruled that a national bank’s power to sell its assets meant a national bank could sell a pool of assets in a securitization, and even distribute the securities that represented the sale, as part of the “business of banking.”[117] This meant national banks could underwrite and distribute securities representing such sales, even though Glass–Steagall would generally prohibit a national bank underwriting or distributing non-governmental securities (i.e., non-“bank-eligible” securities).[118] The federal courts upheld the OCC’s approval of Security Pacific’s securitization activities, with the Supreme Court refusing in 1990 to review a 1989 Second Circuit decision sustaining the OCC’s action. In arguing that the GLBA’s “repeal” of Glass–Steagall played no role in the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Melanie Fein notes courts had confirmed by 1990 the power of banks to securitize their assets under Glass–Steagall.[119]

The Second Circuit stated banks had been securitizing their assets for “ten years” before the OCC’s 1987 approval of Security Pacific’s securitization.[120] As noted above, the OCC had approved such activity in 1978.[37] Jan Kregel argues that the OCC’s interpretation of the “incidental powers” of national banks “ultimately eviscerated Glass–Steagall.”[82]

Continental Illinois Bank is often credited with issuing the first collateralized debt obligation(CDO) when, in 1987, it issued securities representing interests in a pool of “leveraged loans.”[121]

By the late 1980s Citibank had become a major provider of “subprime” mortgages and credit cards.[122] Arthur Wilmarth argued that the ability to securitize such credits encouraged banks to extend more “subprime” credit.[123] Wilmarth reported that during the 1990s credit card loans increased at a faster pace for lower-income households than higher-income households and that subprime mortgage loan volume quadrupled from 1993–99, before the GLBA became effective in 2000.[124] In 1995 Wilmarth noted that commercial bank mortgage lenders differed from nonbank lenders in retaining “a significant portion of their mortgage loans” rather than securitizing the entire exposure.[125] Wilmarth also shared the bank regulator concern that commercial banks sold their “best assets” in securitizations and retained their riskiest assets.[126]

ABCP conduits and SIVsEdit

In the early 1980s commercial banks established asset backed commercial paper conduits (ABCP conduits) to finance corporate customer receivables. The ABCP conduit purchased receivables from the bank customer and issued asset-backed commercial paper to finance that purchase. The bank “advising” the ABCP conduit provided loan commitments and “credit enhancements” that supported repayment of the commercial paper. Because the ABCP conduit was owned by a third party unrelated to the bank, it was not an affiliate of the bank.[127] Through ABCP conduits banks could earn “fee income” and meet “customers’ needs for credit” without “the need to maintain the amount of capital that would be required if loans were extended directly” to those customers.[128]

By the late 1980s Citibank had established ABCP conduits to buy securities. Such conduits became known as structured investment vehicles (SIVs).[129] The SIV’s “arbitrage” opportunity was to earn the difference between the interest earned on the securities it purchased and the interest it paid on the ABCP and other securities it issued to fund those purchases.[

8607,7pa5r3,"The deficit at the end of his 8 years was close to what it was prior to the stimulus package. I'm not discrediting what he achieved at all. But deficit is only a measure of spending vs revenue. The economy was growing, so revenue was up, and spending was slowly decreasing. Those moved closer towards each other for 7 years."
8608,7pa5r3,"Yeah, the economy is instantly responsive when presidents take office. I’m sure Obama fixed everything on day one just like how trump has.

8618,7pa5r3,"They did not reduce the deficit. They simply added less to the deficit than the previous year.

8629,7pa5r3,"> Maybe it was the Gingrich-led Republicans who did all of this.

It wasn't. The 1990 and 1993 budgets raised taxes and cut spending, combined with an economy recovering from the early-90s recession. The spending cuts implemented by the GOP Congresses of 1995-2001 were chump change compared to the 1990 and 1993 budget acts. "
8630,7pa5r3,You could be right

8637,7pa5r3,Oh I am not blaming the deficits on Obama but he did not go out of his way to cut the deficit or worry about the debt. His goals were focused on other things but debt and deficit were not the strong points of obama so focusing on other things might be a better idea or focusing on how bad W bush was to give obama a shit hand

8648,7pa5r3,"It kind of depends on how you look at it though.

Are we saying that they had one year during their presidency which the deficit was lower than the previous year? If that were the case, then we have to include GW Bush Jr in this list.

So then are we saying that the final year deficit of these presidents was less than the final year deficit of their previous president? If that's the case, then this picture works out.

But doesn't using just the final year metric seem a bit arbitrary? 

[A better measure would be to sum up all the years of the term, and divide it by the number of years in the term, if we do that, we get](https://www.thebalance.com/deficit-by-president-what-budget-deficits-hide-3306151):

Bush Jr. (R)|$3.293 trillion|$411.6 billion
Clinton (D)|-$63 billion|-$7.8 billion
George H.W. Bush (R)|$1.036 trillion|$259 billion
Reagan (R)|$1.412 trillion|$176.5 billion
Carter (D)|$253 billion|$60.25 billion

8654,7pa5r3,"Question: How does the debt go up more than any other President over your presidency, yet you claim you reduced the deficit?

Hint: It's impossible. If Obama actually did reduce the deficit, he wouldn't have added more debt than every other President. That's how economics work. Sorry, bozo."
8655,7pa5r3,"What part of my statement is false?

They were the president during those years, and made decisions that stunted our growth."
8656,7pa5r3,"Regardless of who pushed it up, it was raised temporarily to help relieve the market crash in 08 , but any regular budget doesn’t need to be that high."
8657,7pa5r3,"Oh my, what sacred cow of yours did they make hamburger out of?"
8658,7pa5r3,"The point is that for all the posturing the GOP does on spending, the only ones to actually control spending have been democrats."
8659,7pa5r3,You can see the data [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSGDA188S). The image is actually right. 
8660,7pa5r3,"Why?  The deficit was reduced.  Instead of exploding.

It's not clickbaity at all.  You just don't know terms."
8661,7pa5r3,It is not. Just because you don't know the difference between debt and deficit does not mean this is not an easily understandable and accurate statement. 
8662,7pa5r3,I feel like the subset of people who understand derivatives but not the difference between debt and deficit must be limited to you.
8663,7pa5r3,"No, deficit/surplus is just the 1st derivative. It is how much the debt changes each year.

However, this post is about ""reducing the deficit"", which is a change in the 1st derivative (deficit), so would be a 2nd derivative concept."
8664,7pa5r3,"I mean it is true that Obama reduced the deficit over the course of his presidency, but this is meaningless taken out of context. The Great Recession happened very early in his first term, and as a result, the deficit was much higher than historic averages for his first couple of years in office. As such, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the deficit was smaller later in his presidency since the need for this type of recovery level spending was no longer necessary. 

In fact, at the end of his terms, the deficit had returned to average pre-Obama levels. All you have to do is take a quick look at CBO statistics to see this. None of this is to suggest that the Obama administration did anything wrong, but in all honesty its spending patterns were more or less in line with what one would expect based on economic history, nothing more nothing less. Clinton is a much more unique example because his Government actually ran a sirplus."
8665,7pa5r3,Thank you. Your comment explains the difference well.
8666,7pa5r3,"A surplus wouldn't have been bad, but the way we would have achieved it would have been. It would have meant not extending the Bush tax cuts. In times of recession, it's not good to increase taxes or reduce spending. Time like right now, are when we should be bumping up taxes a bit and trying to get a budget surplus to start paying down the debt so the government has some wiggle room in the next recession. Instead, we just passed a massive tax cut that adds trillions to the debt. Literally the opposite of what we should be doing right now."

8671,7pa5r3,"It's easy to add big social programs if you don't care about the costs.  That's why Bill & Hillary's universal health care plan never got off the ground -- they not only cared about controlling costs but explained exactly how they'd do it.  In comparison, the Republicans' Medicare part D drug program was rushed through Congress by Republican leader Tom DeLay, and it left out cost controls.  Even the original Medicare program was implemented without much in cost controls because it was the only way to get support from doctors, and cost containment was phased in, maybe not until the Nixon administration,   One of the architects of the original program, who came back to oversee it during the Clinton administration, Joseph Califano, wrote 2 books about health care costs (read both; in the 2nd book he basically said the 1st book was wrong)."
8672,7pa5r3,"You clearly don't understand debt and deficit.

Deficit is the amount by which the debt is growing each year. It was enormous when Obama took office, which means that he couldn't stop us from taking on debt (you can't just erase the deficit overnight). What he did do, however, is slowly decrease the deficit so we at least weren't taking on debt as fast.

All of that debt comes from a deficit that grew out of control during Bush's presidency."
8673,7pa5r3,There's nothing wrong with public debt as long as you don't experience hyperinflation.
8674,7pa5r3,"I think the last person wasn't accrediting the internet boom to Clinton, but the boom obscured just how far right he was and didn't really move the progressive goal posts."

The Glass–Steagall Act was a part of the 1933 Banking Act. It placed restrictions on activities that commercial banks and investment banks (or other securities firms) could do. It effectively separated those activities, so the two types of business could not mix, in order to protect consumer's money from speculative use.

That stimulus package also helped to end the recession and kick off one of the longest recoveries in history leading to our current booming economy. Also:

>The CBO estimated that enacting the bill would increase federal budget deficits by $185 billion over the remaining months of fiscal year 2009, by $399 billion in 2010, and by $134 billion in 2011, or $787 billion over the 2009–2019 period.

8713,7pa5r3,Excellent rebuttal!
8714,7pa5r3,"I think the obvious way to look at it is over their presidency. The deficit was lower when they left than it was when they came in. Seems simple enough. The average isn't a good metric in my opinion. Obama shouldn't be penalized for Ws giant deficit. And it's not reasonable to just eliminate a record deficit over a single year.

President Larry takes over with the national debt at $22. The first year the deficit is at $5 cause that’s what it was stuck at when he took office, but over the course of his four years he manages to bring it back down to $2. In total the addition to the debt was $29. Which is a 131% increase.

If I earn $50k and spend $60k, my deficit is $10k. I have to borrow money to pay that last $10k that I budgeted (because I happen to know I can easily and cheaply borrow that much). That $10k is then added to my total debt, which is something like $300k increasing to $310k.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub.L. 111–5), nicknamed the Recovery Act, was a stimulus package enacted by the 111th U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in February 2009. Developed in response to the Great Recession, the ARRA's primary objective was to save existing jobs and create new ones as soon as possible. Other objectives were to provide temporary relief programs for those most affected by the recession and invest in infrastructure, education, health, and renewable energy.

The approximate cost of the economic stimulus package was estimated to be $787 billion at the time of passage, later revised to $831 billion between 2009 and 2019.

I get what you are saying, that it might take time to fuck up a balanced budget, and it takes time to correct a bad budget, but I don't agree that looking at only the last year is a fair measure.... maybe a weighted measure would be fair, like their first year is only counted at 25% weight, and the full weight of their budget doesn't count until year 4. 

Finally, since you wanted to address Obama's case specifically, the imbalanced budget of Bush's last year and Obama's first year were heavily impacted by TARP and the Economic Stimulus Act, both of which Obama not only voted in favor of, but defended multiple times, citing that with TARP the banks paid back all of what was lended to them when Romney tried to use it against him in the 2012 campaign.... and Obama was right, to this day few Republicans seem to realize that Obama's lending actually generated income for the U.S. because our treasury made interest on the money that we lent out from those polices.

Deficits don't change overnight.  They have to be gradually lowered.  For a drastic change in deficit, you'd have to spike people's taxes or gut systems that already exist and are being utilized.  Neither are good.

While I don't disagree with this, there are literally hundreds of ways you can gauge something a president has done, and this would certainly be a valid metric to look at, the original discussion was whether Obama lowered the deficit or not.   It was lower when he left office than when he came in, so the claim is true, even if you don't even think it's a useful metric. 

Really, though, the claim is lacking context.  Yes, he lowered the deficit, but to know whether it's an important fact to bring up, you'd want to know *why* you're pointing out that he lowered the deficit.  I think this is geared towards people who claim that Democrats only increase spending and Republicans lower it.  It's a basic rebuttal to a basic accusation."

Republicans can run a successful economy.  Eisenhower did it in the 1950s, but the economy grew slowly, perhaps because of a breather from the hectic pace of WWII or his austerity.

So the best Republican did about as well as the average Democrat.  Also Reagan's economy did better in his 2nd term, when he raised taxes every year, unlike only 3-4 years as during his 1st term.  

One problem with Republican presidents has their recklessness -- voodoo supply side tax cuts under Reagan and George W. Bush, wage-price controls under Nixon.  I'm surprised so few people bring up those price controls because they were truly radical and probably did more harm than people realize.  Former Fed chairman Paul Volcker said they made inflation worse and that it took 10 years to fix the problem; he should know because he's the one who fixed it, by slamming down on the money supply and driving the US into the biggest postwar recession, until the Great Recession, only Volcker's recession did some good.

> Most middle income people could afford a mortgage.

Most middle class people can afford a mortgage up to $300,000. However the areas that had real estate bubbles were seeing home prices of $400k, $600k, $700k etc. and 9% - 12% annual price increases or more, and people willing bought those mortgages thinking the prices would never drop and interest rates would always remain low. They were also pretty stupid and used their houses as credit cards to finance their spending, or tried to get into real estate speculation or house-flipping. Even if it was unethical for banks to allow this, no one forced consumers to make stupid choices. 

>However it was lack of regulations that allowed banks to do this in the first place, which would have been in place with democratic leadership. 

This is a major over-simplification. Good regulations can make a major difference, but are not some magic-bullet. A good example right now would be Canada, which has had a real estate bubble not unlike ours since 2015, despite having a strictly regulated banking system that allowed them to avoid a meltdown in 2008. Economic trends and mentality changes can overwhelm even the best regulations.

> However the community reinvestment act certainly didn't help things as far as over regulation goes.

Again: the CRA had very little (if anything) to do with the housing bubble. "
8833,7pa5r3,"> You don't see how passing laws to allow lower income people to qualify for federally insured loans without having to pass a credit check can accumulate debt,

> NAFTA was awesome for my family/area.

I grew up in a small industrial city in Northern Indiana. I know what it's like to come from a deindustrialized area. International trade had very little to do with it, and everything to do with automation and mergers. I'm sorry if your family members had their jobs directly outsourced. But otherwise, NAFTA's effects on the U.S. economy are wildly overstated. Outsourcing is one part of the picture and completely ignores all the jobs created by increased exports to Canada and Mexico (which have nearly doubled since 2000) and lower inflation.

8845,7pa5r3,">For a drastic change in deficit, you'd have to spike people's taxes or gut systems that already exist and are being utilized.

Sure, but for what it's worth, I think we could spike the taxes of the wealthiest 1%, and spend less on the military to decrease our deficit without much harm economically... Keep in mind, we used to tax the wealthiest people at >90%.

>Is that what happened? Because if it is, you'd have a valid argument.

Yeah, it kind of is, but in reverse. If you look at Bush compared to Obama, Bush only spent more than Obama's **lowest** spending year twice. Bushes last year, where the deficit was at it's highest during his tenure, was about 250% more than his second highest deficit. So the next most important thing is context, ""*Why was Bush's final year so much more expensive?*"" It was expensive because of TARP, which again, is a policy that Obama was in favor of and defended in the 2012 election.

We had special cases in Bush's last year, and Obama's first year... but according to you, it should be fine if we only count years 5, 6, 7 & 8, so let's do that, shall we:

President|Year|Deficit (billions)|Total
:--|:--:|--:|--
Bush Jr.|FY 2006|248|248
Bush Jr.|FY 2007|161|409
Bush Jr.|FY 2008|459|868
**Bush Jr.**|FY 2009|1,160|**$2,028**

President|Year|Deficit (billions)|Total
:--|:--:|--:|--
Obama|FY 2014|485|485
Obama|FY 2015|438|923
Obama|FY 2016|585|1,508
**Obama**|FY 2017|666|**$2,174**

So you see, even when we put the massive stimulus package under Bush, we still see that Bush's 4 year total was less than Obama's 4 year total. Back to my argument about how the last year of a presidents term might be an outlier in terms of spending, I think it applies for both Bush's last year, and Obama's first year.

>I think this is geared towards people who claim that Democrats only increase spending and Republicans lower it.

I think you're right... I think it's important to remind people that Trump is increasing spending, and decreasing tax revenue... we're in for a hell of a deficit next year, and I feel terrible for our next generations. I think lowering tax revenue, especially for the wealthiest people, has been shown to consistently lead to higher deficits. My favorite political fact is that Reagan **raised** taxes at the end of his tenure, and cited remorse that his policies had cut revenue by too much, and lead to higher deficit spending."

Forbes is a business magazine that editorializes a lot in favor of right-wing views, and publisher Steve Forbes supported Trump for office.  Here's a column they published in 2012:  [""Want a Better Economy?  History Says Vote Democrat""](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2012/10/10/want-a-better-economy-history-says-vote-democrat/#76ad1cf6cb44).  
 
Similar articles have appeared in the Wall Street Journal (at least during the pre-Rupert Murdoch Bancroft family ownership days) and Barron's (was once a cover story), neither fans of Democrats.  Why do you think that is?  The closest I could find to a semi-credible excuse was from a book by former Fed vice-chairman Alan Blinder, a Democrat:  bad timing for Republicans.  "

"
8865,7pa5r3,"> CRA most certainly contributed to the housing bubble because it forced banks to meet racial quotas for mortgages given irregardless of financial security.

this is completely, utterly false. The CRA had absolutely no racial quotas. Only 6% of subprime mortgages were issued under the CRA. 

You are conflating two completely separate things: responsible lending towards low-income people (the CRA), and reckless lending by banks that was backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

In the 15 largest metropolitan areas that were hit hardest by the housing crash, 84% of subprime mortgages were issued by banks and other financial institutions that were NOT governed by the CRA. 

The CRA has had overwhelmingly positive effects on poor communities. It has nothing to do with the 2008 crash.

> Also, I think your giving way too much of the blame to middle income people. I agree that middle income people were part of the problem but low income people were also receiving mortgages they couldn't afford.

Again, completely wrong. Subprime does not equal ""poor people getting loans"". You can be middle class, upper-middle class, or even rich, but if you don't handle your money properly (like not paying your credit card bill or mortgage on time for whatever reason), you will be issued a subprime loan. Over 35% of subprimes were issued to investors and speculators who wanted to sit on the property until the prices went up and rent it out in the meantime. Poor people can't take out second mortgages!! Subprime loans were overwhelmingly issued to middle- and upper-middle income people, not the poor. "

So yes, slower job growth. And a much, much stronger economy. Not to mention lower unemployment rates than predecessors. And a 17 year low for black unemployment.

The larger picture of the economy is more important to me than just one indicator, especially when that indicator fails to consider unemployment being lower than that experienced during Obama’s time in office. If job growth is all you care about, Obama is your guy.

“We’re in a bubble,” added Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. “And, frankly, if there’s going to be a bubble popping, I hope they pop before I become president because I don’t want to inherit all this stuff. I’d rather it be the day before rather than the day after, I will tell you that.”

Who would want to side with someone who's constantly shrieking about feminism and racism or someone who's constantly shrieking about needing even more guns and whatever the hell else?
8935,8yxtxa,"I'm guessing those 100 million didn't want either Hillary nor Trump. If they don't want them, why should they vote? I'm not American but if I were, I'm not going to vote for someone I don't want because I don't want the other even more "
8936,8yxtxa,Maybe it's time to start bringing them to your side instead of insulting them.
8937,8yxtxa,"I tried to vote but didn't realize you had to be in a specific place, apparently. I was in college and I just assumed since there was a voting place on campus, I could vote. Boy was I wrong, they told me I had to go where I was registered.....Why the fuck can I not just vote at whatever voting station I damn well please?? "
8938,8yxtxa,"R A D I C A L    C E N T R I S T S

""both sides, many sides"" embodied. "
8939,8yxtxa,But only if they are democratic. Otherwise don’t vote
8940,8yxtxa,I do give a shit. Both candidates were shit so I voted third party. 
8941,8yxtxa,"Give me another choice and I will.
"
8942,8yxtxa,So earn their vote. 
8943,8yxtxa,"I feel like, statistically, if 49% of voters vote Democrat, it's probable that only 49% of non-voters would also be ones to vote Democrat, and blaming non-voters is just an excuse. This party system is terribly polarizing, anyways."
8944,8yxtxa,"How do they not care? They all vote independent of the two parties, but that doesn’t mean they don’t care about certain issues. They just can’t identify with only democratic or republican."
8945,8yxtxa,"2 genders, 2 scoops, 2 terms."
8946,8yxtxa,Maybe the other third is waiting for a party that is not bullshit.
8947,8yxtxa,Hence why the US people deserve what they got.
8948,8yxtxa,"When are people going to realize that there are more than 2 political parties? I voted for Gary Johnson, a libertarian. I still believe that he would of made the best president. I just wish people would be more open to voting outside of Rep & Dem. "
8949,8yxtxa,Its almost like the people yelling on either side are actually a very small part and the vast majority don’t feel nearly as strongly  and likely are reasonable people who can see both sides of issues 
8950,8yxtxa,VOTE LIBERTARIAN AND GET RID OF THE LOT OF THEM!!!
8951,8yxtxa,"What about all the people that can't vote? Like children, non-citizens, and felons."
8952,8yxtxa,Nah that's okay
8953,8yxtxa,"Turnout would probably be higher if you didn't have to register to vote. 

Everyone that is 18+ should be automatically registered. And hey... Why not do the voting on a saturday or sunday when most people are free from work and able to go vote? 

Just my 2 cents."
8954,8yxtxa,Can't be bothered to give a shit. World is falling apart just fine on its own.
8955,8yxtxa,As an American who has mostly been Republican I support the Hell out of this message. Please just vote. I don't care if it's against me. Vote. We still have that right.
8956,8yxtxa,"So is that the 3rd major political party of the US? 

The GNS (GiveNoShits?)

"
8957,8yxtxa,"Why? No politician in any country in the world of any party belongs tk the working class. How can you expect them to fight for your rights when they directly oppose their interests? 

If you wanted corruption free indirect democracy there would be no pardons, no immunities, and most certainly no salaries."
8958,8yxtxa,"There are lots of ways to exercise your agency outside of electoral politics.  Canvassing for specific issues, acting in solidarity with people across the world, throwing a community event, antagonizing structures and actors that antagonize you , forming a union, helping people in your community, distributing pertinent information, volunteering, etc.

There's lots of work that needs to be done that benefits you and your loved ones in concrete and positive ways.

Yes Democrats are into expending welfare, but  also seem to have been in favor of mass incarceration and perpetual military involvement in recent history.

"
8959,8yxtxa,"Yeah, pi charts are awful for displaying data..."
8960,8yxtxa,"Nah, I totally don't give a shit. I'm old, the end is near, let's get weird!"
8961,8yxtxa,How about no one is chosen until 85% turnout
8962,8yxtxa,Yawn
8963,8yxtxa,"Like it or not, the electoral college needs to be reformed."
8964,8yxtxa,"Yea, who do you think that 101 mil are voting for, not democrats. "
8965,8yxtxa,"We give a shit.

The problem is you two parties are two sides of the same coin.

One is nicer to gays. Not much, but still."
8966,8yxtxa,Cared before Wasserman fucked it all up and blamed it on Russia. Democrats can go to hell.
8967,8yxtxa,buncha middle class libs talking down to poor workers of this country. typical r/democrats 
8968,8yxtxa,democracy doesn't work. Getting more idiots to vote won't fix the idiot problem. 
8969,8yxtxa,The God-Emperor protects.
8970,8yxtxa,Trump 2020!!!
8971,8yxtxa,I still can’t believe he lost the vote by the  entire population of Mongolia and still took office.
8972,8yxtxa,Yep. Only the 2 mainstream parties matter. Nothing like hyperboles to fit your narrative.
8973,8yxtxa,"does ""better start to give a shit"" mean ""vote for my less shitty but still pretty shitty candidate or it's your fault""?

cuz no, then I won't. I'll give a shit about reforming the democrats into a party I *want* to vote for instead of them just expecting me to vote for them because they agree with the most baseline *obvious* social policy like women's equality and gay rights"
8974,8yxtxa,"Fuck it, I won’t pick between the lesser of two evils, you’re responsible for whatever they do as well if you voted for them. I’d rather just watch watch it all come crumbling down with a clear conscience. Systems broken as fuck, voting in it hasn’t meant shit for a long time, both parties are  POS, acting like one is better just because you have different taste of shit isn’t for me. "
8975,8yxtxa,Keep pushing socialism and open borders please. 
8976,8yxtxa,"Source? And is this out of all registered voters or the entire population?  

Proportions are off...."
8977,8yxtxa,"If the green section voted third party, that candidate would win."
8978,8yxtxa,"Trump didn't win the popular vote tho, the electoral college voted for him"
8979,8yxtxa,Honestly the chart should show the other party splits. There’s others who care and voted green or independent. 
8980,8yxtxa,The problem is clearly all those pesky voters who vote their mind not both major parties who nominated 2 awful candidates. You want the independent party voters votes? Earn them. They do care that is why they voted independent.
8981,8yxtxa,I'll start to give a shit once I have options that aren't terrible.
8982,8yxtxa,"In Australia voting is compulsory. Sorry, to be more accurate - showing up at a polling booth is compulsory. Once they've ticked your name off you can walk out, or write ""fuck all of you"" on your ballot and put it in the box. But you have to show up.

What that means is that for the political parties, discouraging voters just isn't an option. Not having polls adequately staffed isn't an option. Having any voter wait for hours to vote isn't an option, because that person _has_ to get to the polling booth, and imagine how pissed off they're going to be when they get there?

You might think ""well that just means more dumb people will vote"" but a) fuck you, you just want people to vote for your party and those people are entitled to a voice b) when everyone has to vote the parties _need_ to try and reach out to and educate those voters vs just disenfranchising them and c) just think for one second about whose interests are best served by you believing that, and whether or not you've internalised a lie that they sold you.

It's an absolute joke that your country holds itself up as the shining example of democracy to the rest of the world when your voting rates are that low."
8983,8yxtxa,[removed]
8984,8yxtxa,They should let independent voters vote in the primaries.
8985,8yxtxa,Ever think of having more than two defunct parties?
8986,8yxtxa,"I despise both parties and the other ""choices"" aren't much better"
8987,8yxtxa,This is driving me a bit crazy honestly. [I found a better proportioned version here.](https://www.meta-chart.com/share/2016-election-6)

8993,8yxtxa,"This Reddit is often filled with hate, or republican bashing, and little towards the way of finding solutions. This is the best post I’ve seen in a while. The real question here, is how?? How do we find a way to get them to vote? "
8994,8yxtxa,"Agreed. 

We are supposed to be able to vote for someone, not against someone else."
8995,8yxtxa,Only a dozen out of the fifty states are even swing states.  We should be grateful the turnout is as high as it is.
8996,8yxtxa,But your lack of vote will just make them care about you less. 
8997,8yxtxa,[deleted]
8998,8yxtxa,Gonna lose a lot of Roe v. Wade’s with that attitude. 
8999,8yxtxa,"How about defending democracy? The reason anyone in this country should care about voting is because it's the fundamental right in this system of government, and unfortunately if you don't use it you may lose it along with other basic rights. Anyone who is not participating because the system isn't working needs to realize that it isn't working because they're not participating."
9000,8yxtxa,No one is entitled... however staying home or not voting for someone that agrees with 80-90% of your views has lead us here. 
9001,8yxtxa,If trump isn't reason enough... I can't imagine any reason in the universe would convince you. 
9002,8yxtxa,Ooohhh
9003,8yxtxa,"Also, statistically if the non-voters voted, it's not going to change the outcome."
9004,8yxtxa,If people can't care about there own futures is not up to me to motivate them.
9005,8yxtxa,"They are supposed to care about the issues.

Not looking for someone to wipe their ass.
"
9006,8yxtxa,Seriously. I care and I voted. I didn't vote either R or D because both candidates were shit. 
9007,8yxtxa,"No, they’re entitled to your vote. If you don’t vote for who they want you are a nazi. "
9008,8yxtxa,I'm not a Democrat but man I look at what's going on right now and there needs to be someone to stop it and the elected conservatives arent going to do it.
9009,8yxtxa,Or just not fascist racists. 
9010,8yxtxa,Can they be impressed? Or are they just apathetic critics that think attacking politicians is cool? 
9011,8yxtxa,One side is objectively better though and can be used as path towards reform. 
9012,8yxtxa,"Actually math says the majority is impressed by either party.

The assumption is also that the entire pie is affected.

So when you do nothing, it’s actually doing nothing. It’s not teaching someone a lesson.

"
9013,8yxtxa,But you’re getting one regardless. It’s not like not voting means the government doesn’t apply to you.
9014,8yxtxa,"okay, goldilocks."
9015,8yxtxa,"No one is responsible for wiping your ass.

"
9016,8yxtxa,Isn't doing nothing not going to do anything*.*
9017,8yxtxa,"Get out of here with your logic...and try not to notice, on their amended chart that shows voters who don't give a shit, Rs and Ds are outnumbered almost two to one...try not to notice that they're outnumbered, and they're using insults to try to ""convince"" you to their side. Imagine if everyone in the green slice of the pie got together and came up with an alternate, third party, to outvote and vote out the two parties that both got us where we are today? 

Wouldn't that be something? "
9018,8yxtxa,"There is no perfection. 

What you're waiting on isn't coming. 

And you're just going to end up doing nothing. "
9019,8yxtxa,"Because the other option strengthens the worse evil.

That’s math.

9023,8yxtxa,"This guy is a massive karma whore, take everything he says with a grain of salt"
9024,8yxtxa,So you're one of the people who didn't give a shit then.
9025,8yxtxa,"I know not the intent, but doesn’t this imply anyone who voted outside of the two major parties is apathetic? That’s not a fair implication."
9026,8yxtxa,"Apathy and voter suppression. There's a reason why Dems in power often try to make voting easier and more convenient for citizens, while the GOP in power often tries to make voting more difficult for citizens."
9027,8yxtxa,don't try and look up a similar chart for recent midterm elections then
9028,8yxtxa,"It's not apathy at all. These potential voters have no faith that anyone will or can come along who actually *acknowledges they exist,* let alone even attempt to address their problems. Working people in America, who are up against a wall and increasingly desperate, didn't even get the dignity of lip service from Democrats in 2016, and yet somehow have been getting yelled at for causing them to lose the election.

As a result, things are not trending the way you'd hope. Democrats increasingly reach out to disaffected conservative voters who are rebelling against Trump, despite the fact that they don't statistically exist: Gallup puts his approval among self-described Republicans at 87%. Meanwhile, outreach to people who do not typically vote has been zero.

Personally I always voted for Democrats. I did not really want Hillary Clinton to win the nomination, but I swallowed my bile and voted for her in the general anyway. And guess what I get in return from Democrats? No, I will not be making that mistake again."
9029,8yxtxa,Democrats are the furthest thing from extremists. In any other first world nation they would be a conservative party. 
9030,8yxtxa,"Centrist moderates gave us the government we have now. They gave us a government of the corporations, by the corporations and for the corporations. That just made people stop giving a damn. 

America needs another FDR. Someone that is willing to stand up to the wealthy interests.

Centrists always seem to have tons of wealth and cushy jobs alter they leave office. Centrists are all just people that like the status quo but lack any courage to point out the problems and actually suggest solutions. Centrists are nothing but empty platitudes. 

Americans need to vote for things that actually help all Americans. "
9031,8yxtxa,Agreed!
9032,8yxtxa,oxymoron
9033,8yxtxa,"Please do. And thumbs up on honest self-reflection. I was a non-voter (embarrassed  to say) until Trump came along. Now I live and breathe politics, and will never let America down again, if it survives Trump. It's never too late. "

Also, check to make sure you're still registered (and verify your polling place).  There's been some shadiness afoot as far as purging voter rolls, so it's a good idea to regularly check in and make sure you're still on the up-and-up."
9112,8yxtxa,"No no, don't you understand, you either have to vote for the party that is going to ignore the will of the people and Constitutional boundaries to enrich themselves and a small group of donors, or the party that is going to ignore the will of the people and Constitutional boundaries to enrich themselves and a small group of donors.

NO OTHER OPTION IS ALLOWED YOU HEAR ME?"

9117,8yxtxa,"An ordinary congressional cohort should, and usually would, to a certain degree. This isn't the case though, and it's because the GOP holds all the cards and allowed this embarrassment of a president to get and hold this office, essentially because they want to continue to rape this country and let their corporate masters do whatever they want. It's as simple as that. Trump is a wonderful distraction from their actions, and actually makes hard-line nutcase GOP members look rational."
9118,8yxtxa,"To actively help a party which acts against my interests and beliefs would be better?  To hold my nose and vote for the lessor of two evils?  

No thank you.  With all Trump's craziness, he's undone some of the excesses of Obama that I didn't care for.  When Trump is out of office, the Democrat that replaces him will likely undo Trump's more radical changes.

I think that the solution that would be best for all of us would more federalism in America.  Where in the Constitution does it prescribe that those in New York and those in Alabama need the same health care policies?     If northeastern liberals and southern conservatives spent less time trying to control each other and seesaw the country we'd all be much happier."
9119,8yxtxa,"I criticized Hillary for running the most negative campaign in recent history as proven by independent analysts--- her messages were 80 percent negative. Participation from Democratic leaning groups went down with Republicans had maximum participation-- that's why Bernie resonates so well with Millennials-- because he gave hope for change-- same as Obama did back in '08. 
There is a lot to criticize about Democratic Party messaging -- which so far is a repeat of '16 - all about Trump's negatives. We need some positive messages. "
9120,8yxtxa,Lol Bernie would have campaigned in the Midwest at least 
9121,8yxtxa,I think Vega is talking about non voters who generally don't give a shit. Definitely activism against ICE is by voting people--/ for sure!
9122,8yxtxa,"What does not voting have to do with it?

Even if I said anything about not voting, not voting can be an act of voicing yourself."
9123,8yxtxa,Why?
9124,8yxtxa,"I never said they don't have a platform. There's two problems with it though. 

1, their platform is basically conservative - even in the face of the world-ending awfulness they cry from the rooftops about Trump, their proposals are all bafflingly incremental and insubstantial in response. The Democratic response to the fact that health care costs are spiraling out of control and actually killing people who can't afford insurance is...to force people to buy insurance? What in the blue fuck is that? It's literally something these supposedly villainous Republicans would propose - *and have.*

2, their platform isn't honestly that important to them. They would rather prattle on about Russia this and Russia that than actually face the fact that they are partially to blame for the dire conditions of working people, and actually talk about policy to address it.

I mean, I'd like it if Republicans got their asses handed to them in November, but if it doesn't happen, it won't surprise me. "
9125,8yxtxa,I care about healthcare. Nothing the Democrats are proposing even begins to address it.
9126,8yxtxa,[deleted]
9127,8yxtxa,We don't have a direct democracy. The parties' candidates are LITERALLY the people making policy. Not the people. Keep blaming the electorate though. I'm sure that will work wonders for whatever idiotic proxy for Hillary Clinton is put up by the DNC for 2020.

9135,8yxtxa,"What’s your point, we have an electoral college to keep the keep the mindless hoards at bay. Sorry asshole, but some one who doesn’t pay taxes or owns property shouldn’t have the same influence in politics as I do. That’s the point of the electoral college, because of course a bunch of fucking morons are going to side with someone offering them free shit.

9142,8yxtxa,"Yes you can. Idc who you are but you care about corruption in our government. The cost of college and healthcare. 

Anti corruption message

Edit: do you guys fetishize losing? "
9143,8yxtxa,The reason why your voting options are so shitty is because America is a bare minimum democracy where your only realistic choice is between two parties
9144,8yxtxa,"lol wut.  There's only one party that's been pushing racially-targeted voter ID laws, unconstitutional gerrymandering, and is pro-Citizens United"

9150,8yxtxa,"Ideally you're supposed to vote for who will make all citizens better off, not just yourself, but I guess that's a lot to ask of selfish people. "
9151,8yxtxa,"Yes, they are both still shit."
9152,8yxtxa,"I've think the question is more like, having seen what's happened in the last year and a half, do you think things would have been worse if Hillary had won?"

9154,8yxtxa,"I mean the market was growing under Obama too, do you think he was a great president or no?"

99% of the tax cuts from his only legislative accomplishment has not and will never trickle down. "
9156,8yxtxa,"Guh, so as long as you get a relax cut and your 401k goes up... fuck everything else? 

By the way... the market is kind of waffling lately. "
9157,8yxtxa,Don’t you know America must be a two party totalitarian democracy? ^/s 
9158,8yxtxa,"There are facts though. Any metric that decides how good or bad the American public has it, has a direct correlation to liberal and conservative policies. "
9159,8yxtxa,"Lol, that's not how it works. You're one of those ""I pay your salary"" to cops as they arrest you people... right? "
9160,8yxtxa,"No one does. We are shit in America.

9162,8yxtxa,"No.

9163,8yxtxa,"A bunch of people got together in Charlottesville to demand that a racist statue be preserved. They were mostly white supremacists, and a portion of them were honest to goodness Nazis. And they all voted for Trump, and Trump ostentatiously refused to condemn them. All the racists and Nazis seem to have chosen a side. If I agree with Nazis on what side of the street to walk on I feel like that decision needs closer examination, and you presumably don't feel the need to vote for different political candidates than them. "
9164,8yxtxa,>be quiet so we can be louder
9165,8yxtxa,"**Duverger's law**

In political science, Duverger's law holds that plurality-rule elections (such as first past the post) structured within single-member districts tend to favor a two-party system, whereas ""the double ballot majority system and proportional representation tend to favor multipartism"". The discovery of this tendency is attributed to Maurice Duverger, a French sociologist who observed the effect and recorded it in several papers published in the 1950s and 1960s. In the course of further research, other political scientists began calling the effect a ""law"" or principle.

Duverger's law draws from a model of causality from electoral system to a party system.

9166,8yxtxa,"You understand that it’s not that easy for everybody, right? "
9167,8yxtxa,"The GOP institutes laws that disproportionately affect the poor, students, and people of color: voter ID laws, laws curtailing early voting periods and sites, laws eliminating same-day voter registration, laws permanently banning felony convicts from voting, etc. These laws are deliberately passed to disenfranchise Democrat voters.

It isn't an issue of laziness, and making it out to be such only furthers the growing party divide. "

And the only folks to blame for the 2016 election are the people who pretended to care about progressive issues and didn’t defend them.

Do you understand this?

Hillary and Obama had the exact same policies.

So quit your bullshit, and have a more positive message as an example to progressives.

Stop making pathetic excuses as to why progressives were lazy in 2016."
9179,8yxtxa,"Honestly, if you're not hearing the Democratic message then you're not even trying to listen for it. The Democratic party is the one that believes we should live in an inclusive world where everyone's rights and human dignity are protected, where working people have a shot to make a decent living, where people can receive healthcare without going bankrupt, and we protect our planet. Don't tell me you haven't heard any of that."
9180,8yxtxa,"He lost all mid western states in the primary except Michigan. 

Facts are pesky things. "
9181,8yxtxa,"The voters who don't give a shit that see people trying to infer with ICE and politicians who try to abolish them are just driven further to the right. Republicans don't make activism look ugly. Leftist activists are ugly. When people in the middle see things like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Wpvt3sdXcs , it only helps the right. "

9192,8yxtxa,"> magically going to engage when they didn't during the most divisive political campaign in recent memory

9211,8yxtxa,"Progressives voted! All of them. It was the ""identity"" minorities we lost -- black and Latino participation went down as Hillary focused exclusively on what was once called ""soccer Moms"" -- nearly all her messages were to condemn Trump's unseemly speech and sexism in order to convince middle class white women to vote for her. That was the focus and it utterly failed. The majority of white women didn't vote for her. "
9212,8yxtxa,Wow. You are absolutely in denial or downright brainwashed. 
9213,8yxtxa,"Progressives were active but low income identity groups participation went down

Hillary was strong amoung dems in those very Red states though. That's pretty useful. "
9218,8yxtxa,"Democrats are hardly in control of this. Tbh! There are some strange activism out there around immigration-- many people just want to help ""underdogs"" and then there are illegals acting as activists in themselves. And there are professional helpers of the immigrants too. A surprisingly large amount of nonprofits and governments hire people to support immigrants and that's an activist position-// and tbh, keeping their paychecks requires them to be activists. But obviously this backfires when the ""silent majority"" has other interests. "
9219,8yxtxa,"Man, you suck. I feel like your absolutism helps no one. And if anything, it has allowed your country to have a supposedly left wing arm that would be viewed that comparatively far right in almost any other first world country.

What?

"
9237,8yxtxa,"**Duverger's law**

In political science, Duverger's law holds that plurality-rule elections (such as first past the post) structured within single-member districts tend to favor a two-party system, whereas ""the double ballot majority system and proportional representation tend to favor multipartism"". The discovery of this tendency is attributed to Maurice Duverger, a French sociologist who observed the effect and recorded it in several papers published in the 1950s and 1960s. In the course of further research, other political scientists began calling the effect a ""law"" or principle.

Duverger's law draws from a model of causality from electoral system to a party system.

9239,8yxtxa,"I appreciate you. Vega seems to be doing his best to turn people off of Democrats. I wouldn't call myself a Democrat but being a progressive I end up voting for them more often than not. It was people like Vega that made it hard to vote for Hillary in 2016. I pulled through given the circumstances but the amount of entitlement and bullying I witnessed was pretty frustrating. I know it contributed to a couple of my friends staying home. I imagine there are thousands of other Redditors from r/all here like myself watching Vega repeatedly telling people to ""wipe their own ass"" and it's a bad look. Ruffling feathers is one thing but Vega is not even trying to engage these visitors on an intellectual level. This is a missed opportunity to grow this subreddit. Again though I appreciate you because you are attempting to engage people in good faith. I know Vega is probably not representative of this subreddit but unfortunately this troll is representing Democrats to r/all right now."
9240,8yxtxa,"That’s a load of horseshit. 

She won every minority voting block.

You are still looking for pathetic excuses for the phony progressives. "
9241,8yxtxa,"That's not true..  any of it. 

I live you've been going on a huge hate spiel against Hillary but all progressives voted? Lol"
9242,8yxtxa,Are you ok?
9243,8yxtxa,"Again, if you keeping lying there is no point in the discussion.

Bernie is the one who ignored people of color. 

Most people don’t want single payer. They want universal.

Again, keep lying and you will keep being corrected. 

"
9244,8yxtxa,"Its beyond clear you paid no attention to Hillary. She literally pushed free college! And was quite liberal on many issues. 

She spoke to many groups, just not white women.

You're just reciting cheap, incorrect talking points. "

9289,8yxtxa,"Poor memory? Hillary's Complex Market based Healthcare plan confused many and led to dramatic Democratic loses in the First major debacle of Modern Democratic Party under control of the Clinton New Democrats-- the second debacle was after Obama's Health Care plan... another huge loss of Congress. 

You need to focus on what happens in Congressional races more. Our two biggest losses of Congress revolved around partial complex health care reforms --- maybe it's the proverbial ""third rail""? "
9290,8yxtxa,"Your attitude that the democratic party can do no wrong and if you dont vote for them its a wasted vote is what lost yall the 2016 election, accept that theres problems and you would appeal to many more. "

Tearing him down or saying he didn't attempt his civic duty isn't going to help get out the vote we need. I really mean well by this. I do. And I get you're a realist (we're all trying to be real) but we also need to be responsible for our own actions as well and help our friends and neighbors be able to vote be that by encouragement or by changing the system so it's more flexible. Being mad at each other or tearing one another down is literally what the KGB wants and it's a cancer on our democracy. "

They have to overcome that hurdle in order to enact change.

Imagine how hard it was during the civil rights era. 

This blunt truth is necessary.
"
9301,8yxtxa,"Again I am not mad.

And I owe nothing to anyone but the truth. 

I owe nothing to anyone else progressive except the truth.

I've looked at the evidence and the predictions from people on both sides and I'm inclined to agree with them when they say ACA is going to collapse. They stripped it of important parts, yeah, but the blame would be squarely on the left if it does. 

If it stays and it does implode on its own then the working class are going to take their votes elsewhere in 2018 and 2020 like they did in November. If it's capable of surviving then the republicans can just ease their own system onto it using the ACA as a framework in their own image.  It should be a win-win to wait it out for another year and just say they want to do it right."

If we keep voting for rich people that do not share our issues on an economic level, we will continue to be exploited and dismantled by the rich, their media and their government cronies.

If the GOP decides to be sane and suggest moderate fixes then I'm sure some Dems will vote for it.  The problem is that the GOP language ""failure, disaster, etc"" kind of makes it hard to want to work with them.   People don't like working with assholes and drama queens. "

The subsidies built in to the ACA will prevent a death spiral, although Trump's lack of enforcement of the individual mandate will keep some young healthy people out which will increase premiums a bit. Some rural areas, especially in states with where Republican governors and/or Republican legislatures are also actively sabotaging the ACA will probably continue to have problems finding enough insurers to provide adequate competition. The ACHA would make all of the problems with the ACA much much worse, so the death of this incredibly stupid and destructive bill is a win for all Americans except the richest 1% who won't get their promised tax cut."

9391,61b632,">So now they can work together

That's being... a touch optimistic. All the republicans need to do is come up with something palatable enough for republican voters that their members don't defect out of fear of losing the next election. Why would they need to work with the democrats on it for that?

The one aspect that pisses me off more than any other, is that many self-proclaimed progressives have never bothered to vote in mid-terms, off-years, special elections or primaries, sending a silent/indifferent yet clear signal to the DNC that it needed to shift to the center to woo soft moderates, then these apathetic progressives threw a tantrum in 2016 because ""the party doesn't look the way I want it to look"".  Boo fucking hoo.

Plenty of real progressives have run for office, could have been part of a much larger progressive coalition within the Democratic Party, but have been met by crickets in the stands come election day, their political careers fizzled before they even started, while some hippies I know bitch and whine about ""the political system being corrupt"" while they smoke their pot, drink their beer and never even notice there's a local or state election going on that very same day.  

*""You change and maybe I'll vote.""*  No and fuck you, you lazy idiot, it works the other way around, *""I vote so you will change""*, but **that**... would require an effort on your part, now wouldn't it?  You're just as guilty as Joe Redneck spouting the lopsided toxic shit he heard on the Murdoch and Limbaugh propaganda networks.

The ACA is not a perfect law, but it is a step in the right direction. Obama had to compromise with the insurance companies or else he could not have taken any direction at all. If the Republicans had not spent 7 years of political power to fight it we would have been able to fight the Insurance companies MUCH more strongly to ensure that a greater number of Americans are benefiting from the law instead of just young, poor, and elderly."

In the wake of the ACA our insurance provider jacked up costs and we switched to a different plan with that absurd deductible. My understanding of the issue is that our large family is expensive to cover and we're in the ""sour spot"" of income, especially with my dad being self-employed.

I mean, having a functional large family and living a middle-class suburban lifestyle and knowing I can afford to go to college with the help of my parents are all privileges that I know I'm very lucky to have, and I'm glad the law benefits people who aren't in such cozy financial circumstances. But I do think, like you said, the political climate meant that compromises had to be made and not everyone could benefit from the law. I can't imagine things would have jacked up so suddenly without the passage of the ACA, even if it's a good law.

9495,61b632,"Obama's race made an unknown but non-zero percentage of Republicans more hostile to his proposals.

However, I don't think we have to get into race to explain what happened.

The ACA was a messy compromise with provisions that predictably angered many voters.

For example, race wasn't the reason why some voters got mad about the tax penalty for not having heath insurance for at least one month out of the year.  Anyone who found themself paying hundreds of dollars for *not* having health coverage would be pissed; they would feel like they were paying a tax for being disadvantaged.

Now, there are policy justifications for that tax; I'm just talking about how many voters felt about the situation.

Furthermore, the ACA is a complex law which almost no one fully understands, even if they are highly educated.  After it passed, many voters began to blame Obamacare for premium increases, denied treatments, etc., even if they had no evidence that Obamacare caused those problems.  It became a scapegoat for everything people disliked about for-profit healthcare and healthcare insurance.

The Republicans contributed to those perceptions and took advantage of the resulting anger to achieve electoral wins.  They even sabotaged the ACA to an extent by forcing the federal government to renege on the ACA's risk corridor provisions (basically, a provision in the ACA which said that the gov't would reimburse insurance companies for a certain percentage of transition costs incurred during the ACA's first few years due to the ban on discrimination against pre-existing conditions).  When insurance companies didn't get those payments, they began dropping out of the health exchanges.

All that time, the Republicans didn't have a better plan.  They didn't think they would win the presidency in 2016, so they continued to bitch about Obamacare like an opposition party would: All complaints and finger-pointing, no practical fixes.

That's what put them in the position that they're in today, IMO.  They demonized the ACA, but they can't find enough votes in Congress to pass a more right-wing healthcare law or a more left-wing healthcare law."
9496,61b632,"Then that 20% of voters are idiots. Because it was ""sophisticated"" but transparent. And unless you believed the Pizzagate or Vince Foster level idiocy, there was absolutely no reason still to go for Trump over Clinton. Every flaw Clinton was said to have was had many times over by Trump. And worse than that, he had no experience, no qualifications, no temperament, no policies. 

You can't get around this. It's basically a law of nature. Half of the electorate is dumb as fuck. Now you can tell me that's not productive, but that's not the point. I think we should operate based on a foundation of facts and reality. If it's reality that half the electorate is dumb as shit, then we should acknowledge that and plan accordingly. "

If you take away a person's health insurance, and they can't pay for their own, or even get their own due to pre-existing conditions (think cancer), they die. That's how that happens.

Piss off. We're a world power. We're a developed first world nation. We have one of the strongest economies in the world. We are at a point where we can easily keep these people alive. Funneling that tax money into almost anything else is a disgusting misuse. Keeping people alive is more directly beneficial to the people of the U.S. than building a new, more expensive border wall. I'm not saying Obamacare is the best, or even a good, plan. But it's not like Trumpcare was going to fix it, and ""nothing"" isn't an option. Nobody wants to live in a shithole country where your only options if you can't afford to see a doctor are crippling debt (which isn't even an option if you need continued treatments) or just dying. 

And the constitution was made to be amended - this is clearly a point where the federal government needs to step in. The american healthcare system is and has been godawful.

9516,61b632,"But you can't eliminate the fact that Obama is a Democrat and a liberal. 

So you can't focus specifically on racism since race isn't specifically mentioned by Republicans. They dance around the periphery but they never actually say it. 

They do what they always do. They oppose something because the other side wants it and vice versa. That's how they keep the nation divided."
9517,61b632,"I agree with much of what you said. I don't have anything to add to it.

However, it doesn't speak to my question other than a vague and unsupported statement that his race made Republican's more hostile towards him. 

Are there specific actions or words or policies that the Republicans engaged in that were actually racist?

I'll agree that many conservative voters are racist or at least a bit insensitive about race, and that may be reflected in the policies and votes made by Republican Congressmen/women. 

But I don't see that anything the Republicans have done in the last 8 years is any different than what they did to Clinton. Hell, they are still sniping at Bill Clinton 16 years after he left office. 

It's one thing to say, ""I feel like the Republican's actions towards Obama were motivated by racism"" and it's another to state for a fact that their actions were motivated by racism. 

There's no smoking ""N"" word here. If there is then I'd like to see it."

9522,61b632,Can you back up your own claim first? You're literally asking someone to provide proof of their situation with the ACA while providing 0 proof of your own. I don't believe for 2 seconds the same exact plan (including same deductible) is only $50 more through healthcare.gov.
9523,61b632,You did this for each state in the ACA pool? Did you look at rates for 2010 outside ACA then compare year by year as ACA launched? Did you compare for varying age?

Do you really think Republicans wouldn't have tried if they could have found literally anything to do it with?"
9529,61b632,"They might have a leg to stand on except the ACA was functionally equivalent to Romneycare. Hell they even stripped out single payer in an effort to be slightly more bipartisan, and in order to appeal to one dirtbag democrat who apparently was heavily influenced by the insurance lobby. I rarely say anything is out right racism, but I am at a loss for explanations."

[Southern Strategy during the Obama era](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021934709352979)

[Colin Powell: GOP has 'a dark vein of intolerance'](http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2013/01/powell-gop-has-a-dark-vein-of-intolerance-154019) - Powell is a Republican, so his assessment carries extra weight.  He has worked among Republican leaders and knows them well.

Now, it is always hard to know what someone else is thinking; we can't see inside their heads.  Only in rare cases do we have explicit admissions of racism from public figures.

There are also alternative motives in most cases, usually political ones.  For example, what role does racism play in GOP voter suppression efforts against blacks?  One could choose to believe that those efforts are solely motivated by politics, because blacks overwhelmingly vote Democratic.

In the end, it is a matter of how charitable you are willing to be when assessing the motives of a political party with a long history of catering to white supremacism, usually via dog-whistles, to get votes.  

Personally, I think Democrats sometimes go too far and attribute too many Republican actions (both from voters and politicians) to racism, while many whites and Republicans go to the opposite extreme and demand an ironclad case for racist motivations before they will even entertain the idea.

The truth is that it's hard to know, but at a certain point you have to make an assessment of what's probable while acknowledging the uncertainty."
9532,61b632,"That's exactly what I thought. There's nothing to support the idea that Clinton doesn't care about the poor and middle class and other disadvantaged people. 

She's spent her whole adult life fighting oppressive shit. Going undercover to bust schools for being segregationist, fighting for education for handicapped children. The first time she tried to tackle healthcare as first lady. Changing the rules at the state department to stop discriminating against transgender people on their passports.

Although you might be more like Bernie and think that class is the only issue instead of one of many. I'd say you're wrong on that point and also wrong about Clinton's position on that point."
9533,61b632,"What do you have to do to avoid it? I live abroad as well, and I've never even given it a second thought."

9540,61b632,"And the Left is calling Trump almost everything under the sun. 

That's the game that both sides are playing. 

In fact, that's one of the reason why Trump one. Because the Left thinks that there are some things no one is allowed to say. You can attack women and you can't attack people of color. But everyone else you can say whatever you want even if it's untrue and extremely harmful. 

It's all ridiculous and it's getting us nowhere."
9541,61b632,"That's the point haha, I'm just worried that they might go a bit overboard, especially after how tense the last few days were."
9542,61b632,"It's fine not to agree with Obama's policy. It's not fine to say ""democrats are doing the same thing"". Democrats attacked the bill itself, the complexities in the bill and who it would negatively impact.

Republicans attacked the name Obamacare because a lot of them are racist and they have a voter base with more racists. That's why some trump supporters loss their shit when they found out the ACA and Obamacare are they same thing 

Trump deserves the shit he's getting. Obama ran on hope, fixing the economy, and healthcare. Trump ran on a wall, xenophobia, and saying dickhead remarks.

Obamas first days in Office he was saving the economy. Trumps first days in office he cost businesses close to $200 million dollars in revenue because they're employees couldn't get out of the airport.

Trumps first days in office he gutted the state department, but has not found replacements. Fired  anyone who opposed him. Spat in the face of science with his EPA picks and we haven't scratched the surface

Obama didn't collude with Russia. Obama didn't admit to sexual assault. Obamas wife and kids didn't stay in Chicago costing tax payers money. 

It's not about ""not being allowed to say what you want"" it's that some people are assholes, have backwards ass thinking, and thinks ok to voice those fact-less assertions without backlash. 

It's not a game both sides are playing. Trumps is deserved. "

I don't think we should only have one party but the Republican Party needs to go back to being a Conservative party for the good of America. "
9598,6bs97g,"This is a good point, although it does assume a lot. The GOP and the dems are the result of our first past the post voting system, which is the real issue. This is compounded by money in politics. The parties, knowing they are essentially untouchable because forming an opposition party is ultimately counterproductive because you will be lifting votes from the party you theoretically find less reprehensible, have both turned into bloated, lazy parodies of ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" that both serve private interests before the people. Neither party wants to eliminate fptp voting, because it all but guarantees their continued relevance. It's why we see the dnc fighting so hard to push back against progressives entering the party as well, because they've made it clear they'd only be using the party to help dismantle the system the party has been complicit in creating and maintaining. As it is, even if the GOP imploded, another ""conservative"" umbrella party would materialize in opposition to the dems. Maybe even with new faces, but you could be sure the people in the background we don't see wouldn't change. But a democrat-run single party state wouldn't happen. We're stuck in this useless binary until the American people demand change and actually show up to run and vote in primaries before it elections get pared down to rubber-stamped, party-friendly candidates we get to ""choose"" between. 

"
9599,6bs97g,It does need reform thats for sure.
9600,6bs97g,"I agree that wishing for one party is dumb, but I think the implosion of the Republicans would inevitably be tied to the emergence of a new party rather soon.

It's not that uncommon for the definitions of parties to align around different issues. There was a time when Democrats were racist bigots and KKK members. There was a time when Republicans started the Department of Education, Environmental Protection Agency and national highway system. There was a time when Democrats were the anti-privacy, national-security champions and when Republicans were the peaceful vote. Any massive defeat or damage of the Republican party might be helpful in that it allows us to redraw the line between the parties again.

Libertarians could take Republicans' place which would make the debate more about the means (fiscal policy, what is done by government) since they agree in many ways on the social goals (e.g. marry who you want, smoke what you want, define your gender how you want, define your family how you want, have sex how you want, etc.). I think that would be the cleanest replacement because it'd allow Democrats to stand for the same sort of platform but would still be a thing enough people would rally around to form a viable alternative party. If that didn't happen, then it'd likely be a much more piecemeal redraw of the issues."

9635,6bs97g,I agree that voting system reform and party funding law reform is required before you break this cycle.
9636,6bs97g,The money that funds Republicans will just fund another conservative party that supports big business. Without serious reform to party funding laws you won't get anything new. The policies of the Republicans are defined by corporate interest.
9637,6bs97g,Ha ha. You need to stop acting like Trump voter and have a more international outlook. The US system is soooo fucked.
9638,6bs97g,"It's the same electoral college we've had for more than 240 years. Hell, its better now. Originally, electors didn't even have to do what voters wanted."
9639,6bs97g,"The electoral college is problematic, but it's still democracy. It's a democratic republic. Democracy in the sense of each person has an equal say in all issues is virtually impossible to implement. So, very immediately, the issue becomes how far removed (via representatives) is the democracy and what should the value of a person's vote correlate to. Neither of these has obvious or definite answers.

Given that we have states governments with higher autonomy and more governmental responsibility compared to other countries, at the founding we came up with the bicameral legislature as a compromise that ensured that small state issues weren't essentially ignored by the congress which would be dominated by states with more people. In present day, 63% of the population lives in the 3.5% of the land area that we deem cities. There are multiple rational responses to how that should impact voting. In one sense, maybe a popular vote is good because it represents the most people directly. However, in another sense, maybe the popular vote is bad because we might consider each voter as a representative of their circumstances and in that case the ""majority"" represented only 3.5% of the land area which might translate into their capacity to appreciate environmental issues, agricultural needs, realities of the borders, etc. Additionally, the electoral college forces, in theory, some sense of widespread support. Because of the electoral college, it's really hard to win the election by having really strong regional support. Winning twice as strongly in New England doesn't prevent you from needing to appeal to states across the country. That ties into what I mentioned above, but it also discourages polarizing candidates and encourages candidates who can get some appeal in each of the many different cultures/geographies of the county, therefore, encourages candidates who appeal to the fuller set of issues in the country. That is a good quality for national leaders.

There are downsides, of course, but I don't think your insistence that it's not democratic is fair or your cynical/narrow interpretation of its purpose and effects. The downsides are mainly how it impacts third party candidates and how it influences the campaigning focus."
9640,6bs97g,I'm from Alabama as well and attend The University of Alabama. It is sad how many people here do not pay attention to the corruption. I know so many people that are Republicans and won't recognize how bad they have been doing or how under qualified they are(Trump).

9660,6bs97g,"Yes, the parties are driven by donor/corporate interests, however, fiscally conservative parties don't have to be socially conservative as Republicans are. That's why I thought that the Libertarian party seems like it could fill the void. Corporate interests funding Republicans mainly want lower taxes for themselves and fiscally conservative policy which is met by the Libertarian party as well. However, that would represent a major shift because Libertarians, despite being fiscally conservative, are socially liberal. They beat Democrats to many socially liberal issues by decades. As I said, it'd be a substantial shift to government to have Libertarians debating Democrats because rather than debating about if gay people should be able to get married or if the war on drugs works, they'd agree on the answers to those two questions and simply be debating about the most appropriate way of implementing that policy.

At the (inter?) national level, you have the trade deals. You often see r/futurology talking about the Ball State University study where 900,000/6,000,000 manufacturing jobs were lost to trade, but MIT in contrast puts it at 2,400,000 jobs lost due to the Chinese alone, not even counting NAFTA. These are good paying jobs lost, and households that flip red.

At the state and local level, corporate income tax. My state Connecticut used to have lots of industry and corporations (insurance, hedge funds etc.) but this all went away when the Democratic governor levied a corporate tax. My father, a printer, was laid off when RR Donnelly consolidated into indiana, which has no such tax. It's the same at a larger level. So when you see that detroit has its own corporate income tax its easy to see why no sane business would open there.

Minimum wage raises in fact act as consumption taxes, as higher wages become consumer burdens. With 67% of the impoverished out of work and 25% underemployed, what minimum wage hikes end up doing is increasing unemployment, redistributing wealth to the middle/upper-class kids working part time at the cost of a cost of living hike the poor. Past experience shows minimum wage hikes redistribute the wealth across all classes but disproportionately hurt the impoverished, who are without work.

Illegal immigration again benefits the employers, with the cost of living decrease due to illegally low wages helping the impoverished and rich. HOWEVER, this artificially deflates wages, hurting the working class.  This is why totally ignoring the border was a bad idea for Hillary. Amnesty didn't work at all, so people took what they saw as a (even if it was dubious) solution rather than no solution. Ignoring or failing to address key policy issues has really hurt Democrat credibility.

More socially conservative people will argue stop and frisk really does reduce crime ( which it does at a moral cost). Violent crime concentrates in minority (esp black) communities due to the cycle of fatherlessness/poverty. When around half the serious crime is in concentrated areas, this leads to increased police presence, meaning police are far more interfering in these communities. It's just how it works, sadly. Don't like it but it saves lives long term.

Couple all of that with the ignorance of many Trump voters (just google the videos of interviews with them at those violent rallies), and I don't think there's anything he could do that would make them bolt.

The vast majority of corporate sponsors don't care about either of those issues. Of the minority that do, it's an even smaller minority that cares so much that they'd go against popular opinion of the party's voters to back that position. They care about Republican fiscal policy. It happens to be that the Republican base/platform pairs that fiscal policy with the socially conservative interests that the voters have.

Ball State was also the lowest number. Many believe labeling China a normal trade partner in 2000 under Clinton was the biggest problem. January 2016 found [PDF] that competition with China had a much bigger negative impact on U.S. jobs since 2001, when China joined the WTO. Hanson, an economist and trade expert at the University of California, San Diego, says that the steepest decline in manufacturing jobs, which fell from seventeen million to eleven million between 2000 and 2010, is mostly attributable to trade with China and underlying technological changes. “China is at the top of the list in terms of the employment impacts that we found since 2000, with technology second, and NAFTA far less important,” he says. MIT again puts China alone at 2,400,000 jobs killed.

CBO states moving up Fed. minimum wage to $10.10 like in my state would kill 500,000 jobs and get 900,000 out of poverty. Which is cool but then you factor in the cost of living hike on the other 39 mil impoverished which would be far more than the benefit to the poor even if you lowball. CBO also states the net benefits of minimum wage hike is between all classes (because of middle class people working part time), but we both know who cost of living increases hurt the most.

S&F gone 2013. Murder increased by 10% 2014-2015, predicted to go up again ( Pew). 2016 has also seen the first increase in violent/net crime. Compare this to what was a strong downward trend. I mean you can argue equal protection, but when half of the violent crime is by a certain group (FBI), half the people being of that group being stop and frisked is arguably proportional. You would have to weigh the forth amendment against the danger in that case.

It's pretty accurate. All of our business is gone (even Hartford insurance), and our economic performance is dismal. The businesses really are relocating. There's no other explanation.

I also have gripes with the hi-cap trading taxes Bernie was going to use to pay for college. Bringing up capital gains would be far better, but a hi-cap tax would tank the economy and underperform based on every past example we have. (I'll elaborate when I have time).

For u/crazyalbo

Globalization has benefited the net economy at the cost of the working class. The people who benefit most are the very rich due to MUCH higher profit margins, then the very poor who get a cost of living decrease. The working & middle class only see wage deflation and loss of jobs.

What I'm worried about is not income inequality (which rises whenever you lower taxes to promote growth and lowers when you raise taxes to consolidate gains) but wealth inequality. After 08, Pew puts household wealth down ~90% for the lower, ~50% for the middle, and only ~20% for the upper class. The poor are skating on much thinner ice than we're used to. 

I can mount a pretty good defence of reaganomics, which I find leads to benefits to all but increases inequality. Which would be alright if everyone was in a similar boat to start, but the wealth gap as well is not pretty.

Personally I believe much of the problems that the US faces is due to the shift of business/manufacturing towards international centers that have lower costs of production, over-head, and labor. The world is globalizing, which conservatives want to fight so bad but can't because advancement of technology forces globalization no matter what they want save for the strategy of isolationism. 

So, since the world is becoming a more global market, corps abuse the lower costs they have in countries such as China with low regulations and a currency system that is so transparent that it's a sheet of black tape. 

My opinion is in order to create a more balanced global economy there needs to be a global oversight board that maintains fairness in the many avenues of cost-cutting and capital funding. Right now jobs go to the east because it's cheap there but as these countries evolve into the first world countries they are the globe will need to maintain the spread of jobs throughout the world by factoring comparative advantage at a policy level. I.E. forcing countries who produce a certain product to do so because they can benefit from the jobs this makes available. Countries that don't have a comparative advantage in production would be forced to focus on providence of services. 

How do you feel globalization is affecting our economies/global economy? Do you think a global oversight org. would be too powerful or do you agree as think it is necessary for the future the earth is approaching?

9726,6bs97g,"> Because you are locked into a two party system

As a Libertarian (i.e. embarrassed by how socially conservative democrats are and how fiscally liberal Republicans are), I understand presenting this as an issue since the debates are often framed around platforms that create a false choice (e.g. if you believe in gay rights you must also agree with forced union membership, if you believe in gun rights you must be pro-life on abortions). However, in all fairness, the two party system is only as bad as its capacity to prevent people from entering and changing those parties. The performance of Trump and Sanders who were both party outsiders has shown that the two party system is not that bad in that regard. Both of them (even the one that lost the primary) caused important shifts in the party platform. Can we do better? Yes. Are we ""fucked""? I don't think so.

>  with both sides driven into serving corporate interest

The tricky truth is that, regardless of donations and campaign finance, powerful individuals and corporations have a disproportionate voice and a disproportionate capacity to factor into decision making. Campaign finance is a nice scapegoat for a problem that is almost impossible to fix and will still exist even if donations are banned entirely. At the same time, because of the reason I just said, I'm incredibly skeptical of any country claiming that they got around this. Overcoming corporate interest (or more appropriately, the influence of the few and powerful) involves severely disrupting the capacity for the free press (corporations' ability to communicate), for free speech (celebrities of business, politics or elsewhere able to direct attention cheaply), etc. Money is just one way among many that candidates who have the approval of the powerful are advantaged.

> in the hard right wing of the spectrum

This is largely because of, not in spite of, the fact that we are a democracy and that democracy is working. Areas where we are at the right are generally there because substantial amounts of the country believe that stance. It turns out that being against prostitution is really common so we don't really debate it. It turns out that being against federal-level universal healthcare is pretty contested which is why there is a lot of deadlock and difficulty when one side tries to do something there either way. It turns out that being in favor of a softer stance on drugs is becoming popular which is why both parties have been softening their stance on that in congress and has tied the government's capacity to act on some of the laws that do exist. So, the fact that it's to the right isn't a poor reflection on the system. It's a reflection of the balance of American culture itself.

That being said, it's hard to immediately equivocate that with being fucked. Aside from where people settle on that spectrum being pretty arbitrary in its objective basis, left-right is an oversimplified view of politics as is the notion you seem to be implying that there is a clear bad-good spectrum where since we're to the right of Europe coming around to Europe-like solutions is improvement for us. As I said, I'm a Libertarian, so I disagree with many of the areas where we are to the right (e.g. drugs, prostitution, family planning, marriage, gay rights, transgender rights, immigration, treatment of muslims, etc.), but at the same time, I don't see Europe as the only or the best way forward. I think they diverged down a path that (in a region/population as large and varied as the US especially) would only slow social progress. That ends up being another issue in the US compared to European countries. Many supposed conservatives are really just people who believe in the tradition of deferring to the states. That's because trying to solve issues in a way that Texas and California will both be satisfied is challenging so it creates deadlock or resentment. In that sense, liberal people may still vote not to do things at the federal level, making the more appropriate metaphor that the states correspond to European countries. In that sense, a lot of the states are indeed quite more to the left than the US as a whole.

> Nobody has any appetite or power to reform the two things that will change this (party funding and electoral reform).

For one thing, we've come a long way. Initially, the president was voted for by state congressmen who were voted for by white men. Over time, not only did we expand who is allowed to vote, but we managed to change the system multiple times ultimately to being based off of the popular vote in that state. Even now, that's not firmly held. Maine and Nebraska distribute their electors based on the popular vote and Virginia proposed a similar plan. That is alongside [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact) which is a persistent effort to shift to a popular vote. Other things like ranked voting have been implemented in some states as well. The curse of the Electoral College is also its strength: states have a lot of freedom to choose how they allocate their electors. As a result, there is a pretty continuous, but gradual evolution in how our elections work. Our system has never really stopped evolving toward an all inclusive popular vote and while it's not happening overnight I don't think it makes sense to say it's not happening or can't happen.

As for campaign finance, at the federal level we do have government-funded campaign finance which isn't perfect but was utilized by the Reform party. We also have ways at the state level to save or raise money. I don't recall the exact number, but the performance of the Libertarian party in the 2016 election ends up saving them many millions of dollars for the next election. Some states, like CT, have their own programs for financing campaigns through government. At the same time, Democrats generally claim to support campaign finance reform at the national level, with Clinton and Sanders bring it up a lot. So there are existing and proposed steps forward here as well. Also, the candidates that raised the most money in the primaries (Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders) didn't win. Money isn't everything and the use of that money is a focus of reform as well.

My point isn't that this is all perfect. It's that we're not ""fucked"" as there is a pretty viable path forward that we've been working toward and that many of these issues exist in other forms in government who claim to have solved them. It's simply not an easy thing to solve."

""In the United States, for example, wages of less-skilled workers have fallen steeply since the late 1970s relative to those of the more skilled. Between 1979 and 1988 the average wage of a college graduate relative to the average wage of a high school graduate rose by 20 percent and the average weekly earnings of males in their forties to average weekly earnings of males in their twenties rose by 25 percent. This growing inequality reverses a trend of previous decades (by some estimates going back as far as the 1910s) toward greater income equality between the more skilled and the less skilled. At the same time, the average real wage in the United States (that is, the average wage adjusted for inflation) has grown only slowly since the early 1970s and the real wage for unskilled workers has actually fallen. It has been estimated that male high school dropouts have suffered a 20 percent decline in real wages since the early 1970s.""

However, he is the acting president. I mean he has is at his finger tips EVERY single other power the executive branch has and submitting candidates for the supreme court doesn't fall into some kind of different category. 

This also doesn't deal with the fact that bringing forward an investigation could be a way to thwart future presidents from nominating justices, or any other aspect of the office of the President and sets a horrible precedent. "

The Senate is under ZERO, NONE, etc obligation to confirm or even agree to hear a judicial appointment.  The US Constitution states clearly that any nomination requires the consent of the Senate.  The Senate did not consent, and since Obama was not a king, and was merely the head of a co-equal branch of government, he was owed nothing, especially as the Senate, with GOP backing had already given him two seats on the USSC."

“Obstruct, block the Justice”

Okay, but how? Confirming only requires a majority vote, which the Republicans have and reaching quorum only requires a majority of Senators to appear. Do you imagine Democrat senators just telling “obstruct! block!” and then the nominee going away?

“Pack the court”

What on earth are you talking about? Republicans have an overwhelming majority in the House and a majority of the Senate. If anyone is packing the Court right now, it will be Republicans.

“split CA”

Honestly don’t know what you mean by that or how it could be used to block a SCOTUS nominee.

“really any procedural trick”

I truly think it’s hilarious that uninformed  people on the internet keep saying things like this. As if any legislation or appointment can be stopped with just the right procedural trickery. Of course, they don’t actually suggest a “trick” that will work. But sure, go ahead and trick them!"

9892,8ukhf3,Under Democratic rules supreme court justice confirmations still required a supermajority. The Republicans changed the rule in order to steal the seat because they didn't have the votes to get a supermajority and wanted their guy instead of the one who was nominated by Obama.

9896,8ukhf3,"You're right. Truly thinking like Republicans means getting more specific. Identify two Republican senators in states with Democratic governors. Dig up or make up some dirt on them and get the collusion of the supposed liberal-leaning media to eat and regurgitate that dirt. Raise calls for those senators' resignations, get new senators appointed, and flip the senate.

Alternately, identify two Republican senators who most dislike Trump. Bribe them with whatever we have--power, seats, influence, actual cash money--to switch their affiliations to independent and then caucus with the Democrats. Flip the senate.

After that, the judiciary committee simply refuses to consider any nominee that Trump puts forward, citing precedent and the fact that Trump is under investigation. 

After that, it's time to get dirty for the 2018 mid-terms. Swift-boat the living shit out of Republican nominees. Place mass Robo-calls to likely Republican voters giving them the wrong date or location to go vote. Say stuff like, ""Remember, voting booths are monitored by metal detector, and bringing a gun to your polling location is a federal crime."" Use false-flag push polls.

If you think it’s possible, then go for it, but it’s not. The world isn’t a badly-written TV show where you can just get some Senators to resign in shame. Also, even if we lived in a fantasyland where this were possible (to do in an extremely short amount of time no less) there wouldn’t be time to hold a special election before the appointment and so the Senate would STILL be majority Republican.

Identifying two Republican Senators to bribe is ridiculous and the chances of it working are near zero. Setting aside the fact that the Senators would reject a straight-up bribe because they would expect they were being trapped, appointing a SCOTUS Justice is one of their most prized roles. Rejecting a Republican nominee is anathema to everything they stand for. There’s no bribe big enough. If you think there is, go ahead and offer it. Watch what happens.

Your plan is naive and juvenile to the extreme. Frankly, it’s embarrassing that so many Democrats are spewing nonsense like this. “Oh, we’ll just bribe senators or force them to resign,” that’ll do it!

If you want to fundamentally change how Supreme Court justices are put into position, then by all means express your views in that regard. If you want to say Trump is guilty before proven as such, throw out due process, strip him of his obligations and rights to the office BEFORE the investigation has finalized that’s fine. You’re not better than the republicans and I won’t be counted among those who do not care for the rule of law."

If the Republican Party wants to break all the rules, than either we need to find a way to hold them accountable, or change the rules. But playing a game where both sides don’t abide by the rules, is not how we should be governing. 

It’s a pathway to more corruption. I’m not making a slippery slope argument, it’s just the state of humanity and this country. We can’t keep lowering the bar, we already can barely look in the mirror.

It has been the longstanding position at the DOJ that a sitting President can’t be indicted and Mueller’s office has indicated that they are operating under that norm. Therefore I think it’s extremely unlikely that Trump will be indicted as President. It is certainly possible that he’s indicted when he becomes a private citizen again.

I do think it’s telling that instead of addressing whether the President will be indicted as President, you resorted to baseless name calling and listed off a bunch of other people who have been indicted. Probably because you know you’re wrong."

Take it from one of the former republicans bearing no responsibility for trump or state of their party, but they got their gig at MSNBC! (See hugh Hewitt-using as the example because he doesn't belong having a show there). 
I'm all for an oppositional platform but let's use guests for that... Not time slots for the ""suddenly my country is falling apart"" (would love to see how many votes R in 2016) and I'm outraged. 
Karl Rove...remember him and Dick Cheaney (throw in Rumsfeld)...they were doing trump lite (they would have gone further but times were different. You didn't have pres paying off porn stars and NOT be big news. Can you imagine Cheaney and Rove in THIS environment. Haliburton would have been run by his friends, like Don JR and Eric running Trump but Donald not involved at all right? Richard Painter who was ethics lawyer under Bush wouldn't have stood for it. Where's the people who are supposed to be checking and dealing w all these conflicts of interest. I know lawsuits pending but no new news? That Trump DC should be shuttered or no foreign dignitaries/their parties allowed to stay there. Muellers investigation is obv on point and he can't be dealing w everything but the conflicts of interest seem so prevalent and obvious. "

10024,7qjm8m,"HAMILL: This is the biggest fake news story of the week. And it’s interesting to sit back and watch that people are so angry over things that the president didn’t say, they’re more angry than they are at the Clintons for getting rich off of poor Haitians. You can ask all of the Haitian-Americans that have been protesting against the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation for years. You can also ask Klaus Oberwein, the former Haitian government official that has all the dirt on the Clinton Foundation — oh, wait, actually you can’t ask him because he mysteriously committed suicide the day before he was supposed to testify —

RUBIN: What are you talking about? This is nuts.

REID: Hold on a second, let me ask you a question, Stephanie. Did you get talking points before you came here, from the RNC or the White House? Because it’s interesting that yesterday, Mark Burns, who was the surrogate that we had on on the Trump side yesterday tried to roll out the same Clinton stuff. Did you get talking points before you came here?

HAMILL: Joy, I didn’t get talking points. This is something I’ve covered for many years …

REID: Hold on. I don’t know you, Stephanie, we don’t know each other, but let me just explain to you: This is not Fox News. We’re not going to play the game of rolling out crazy conspiracy theories in the answers to my questions —

HAMILL: It’s not a crazy conspiracy theory.

REID: Hold on! If you have an answer to my question, I’m going to let you give it, but what you are not going to do is throw out crazy conspiracy theories to try to take us off track. So I’m gonna let you pause for a minute, I’m going to put you to the side for just a moment. I’m going to go to my other guests, because they’re more familiar with the way that we do things here.

There is the transcript for you."

10063,7qjm8m," a couple years ago, I realized that most forums devolve into Trolling.

So when and if I care to respond, I stop reading after the first logical conclusion that I disagree with.

Then I just discuss that logic, regardless of the entirety of whatever it is they're trying to discuss. It's generally effective, in that I can focus on one fruit of the poison tree."

10067,7qjm8m,"Not for ratings, some news outlets genuinely try to show every side of a story. The only problem is that the GOP and trumps administration have basically decided that facts are irrelevant, so it looks very sensational when you have any of them on. I remember during the Bush admin they’d get just normal Republicans to speak for their side and even though I disagreed they at least didn’t live in a fantasy land. "
10068,7qjm8m,"I mean Jennifer Rubin is a conservative, and she was there..."
10069,7qjm8m,"Well, you want to represent both sides of a discussion, which is why you have someone like Jennifer Rubin there. Not everyone is rational though and will throw out crazy conspiracies or ridiculous arguments just to win the political point. The biggest problem with the blind allegiance to political figures arises because there aren't 2 sides to the ""shithole countries"" discussion, so there wasn't anything the Trump advisor could've done except trash Trump - which she can't do."

It is crazy to watch

"
10096,7qjm8m,Occasionally the person interviewing will do somewhat of a scathing question that demonstrates the ignorance of the mouthpiece tho. But there's rarely anyone calling out -- probably because NPR does rely on some public funding and if they're calling out GOP spokesmen the budget will be cut.
10097,7qjm8m,"Didn't NPR move away from the whole ""equal time for both sides"" idea a few years ago? I remember hearing that they were not just going to blindly give both sides time if ""a side"" are just spewing BS the whole time.

There lies the problem with the media today IMO. It brings ratings, yes, but it pollutes the truth. 

You can ask someone if the sky is blue, and they will go on a tangent about some random topic to draw a false equivalency, and never actually answer the question. There is only so much time for the segment, so they can just continuously not answer questions and get their talking points out. Whats worse is that these are the same people who are trying to de-legitimize sources, and news as a whole. If someone has their back up against the wall, and has no logical defense, the best strategy is to de-legitimize the sources of this...and unfortunately it's a solid strategy. By deligitimizing sources of truth, you get a two-fer. If these sources have dirt on you, you can just say ""see i told you, they are just full of lies"" and then when they rightfully call out your lies, you can just say ""I've been telling you this forever, you can't trust them"" bringing further 'legitimacy' to you in your supporters eyes. Now, your supporters who listen to this are defacto surrogates, defending you on the ground when normal everyday people are challenging you. Your supporters blindly support you in the face of criticism, because in their eyes, you are the only source of the truth.

""gotcha questions""
""Liberal Media""
""Fake News""

It's literally insane how well it works. "
10098,7qjm8m,"I find those segments hillarous, it's like the comidic relief charater in a movie. 

They had this one guy on this morning talking about how the missile alert system in hawaii is a bad idea and we (the us) doesn't really have any plans for people to get to safty cause they don't exist. In the next sentance he said how our defense plans revolve around a second white house and getting the president to a shelter. "
10099,7qjm8m,"This makes me miss Diane Rehm the most, she shut that down politely but quickly, and forced the conversation to move on to something else if they refused to be reasonable and stop lying. Well, sometimes she would interrupt and have the person from the other side do the fact checking, but again it was politely and firmly and neither side felt attacked by her or slighted by her.

Maddow had on KAC a while back and they both went back and forth for what felt like forever with so much information and backstory in each chosen sentence and phrase that it felt like they got a whole novel's worth of stuff out. I caught so much of KAC's that I only knew from following conservative blogs and news sites (just to see what they're up to) that would have sounded completely innocuous without that knowledge that I often wonder what else was said by either of them that just went straight over my head.

10143,7qjm8m,"I have not problem with GOP surrogates getting air time, I don’t want to live in an echo chamber, but if they are just going to lie, derail the conversation and even promote conspiracy theories and egg on their base instead of actually telling the truth and adding to the national discourse, then I have no use for them in my news. 

If I wanted to hear delusional liars I can go over to any of a number of outlets, many right here on reddit. The news is supposed to be honest and there’s no point in even having them on if they’re not going to be honest with us. "
10144,7qjm8m,"NPR does lean towards journalism, but when you do a round table to discuss something you’re gonna end up with a lot of opinions and guess work sort of by default. Especially speculating on political stuff, not like anyone can actually say 100% a vote will go this way or that. 

My problem is when some far right douche nozzle comes on for no other reason than to muddy the conversation. It’s one thing to share an educated opinion that may lean liberal or conservative, it’s something else entirely to just spew nonsense and whataboutisms to try and confuse people. "
10145,7qjm8m,"God I love BBC journalists. They get one whiff of bullshit and they pounce.

Maybe if Republicans, trump and his surrogates could actually tell the truth once in a while then I wouldn’t be calling for journalists to exclude them. But there’s just no point in giving someone air time if they’re going to tell bold face lies unless they’re going to be challenged.

10152,7qjm8m,"Here’s the thing, not all opinions are created equal nor do they deserve equal time.

Shutting down an opinion could make an echo chamber or it could keep the conversation going without cluttering the issue with irrelevancies.

Listening to people try and defend this tax bill was maddening. When asked about its huge unpopularity they either ignored the question or looked right in the camera and said “no, it’s is popular, you’re just seeing Democratic sour grapes because we’re giving money back to the people.” "

10188,7qjm8m,"I actually agree with quite a bit of what you're saying. I'm very upset that both sides of the aisle stood up and applauded at Obama's last state of the union when he gloated that we spend more than the next 10 countries combined on military. I'm not all that impressed by that... We have a military industrial complex that is out of control. I know that there are countless military contractors foaming at the mouth as we speak, just waiting for Trump to get them some work. Both sides are pushing the ""best military in the world"" bullshit but I want the best education and best healthcare in the world. We can't claim either of those things, and that's an absolute joke.  So yeah, I think we're on the same page. 

This country has already forgotten what happens when you try trickle down and deregulation. We saw disastrous results as recently as 10 years ago, yet we're doing it all over again. A lot of banks went out of business, a lot of people lost their homes and their retirement funds, we almost lost most of our auto manufacturing industry, and then Obama got us out of that and got the economy booming, yet people had the nerve to say Obama destroyed our economy and Trump needed to fix it?  The people who went through the most recent recession didn't remember how that happened and didn't speak up?  Ridiculous how short term the memory is with the masses.

And yeah, people have forgotten how hated Bush was and how wrong that war was. I'm totally with you on that.

My only concern is that the two party system seems to me to be what we're stuck with. I don't know how to get the masses voting another way. So I simply have to advocate for the side that is right on most of the issues and my only hope for any progress is that the pettiness between the aisles tones down eventually through career politicians who are serving for the right reasons, and that hopefully presenting serious news like it is Entertainment Tonight and social media spreading of misinformation become things of the past.

Because having opinions that can be defended isn't easy, it forces you to confront your ego and deal with any inconsistencies in your logic, which has been known to cause a type of fight or flight response in the brain.

As the state of the world continues to get worse, liberalism and other """"""moderate"""""" ideologies will be tossed aside, and politics will become polarized, most likely between the far libertarian left and far authoritarian right (the libright is a joke and the authleft has been dying for decades)."

10257,9g2sqt,"Modern American Democrats aren't liberals - they're left-wing conservatives.

By the classical usage, the usage in place in most of the rest of the world, and the usage by which the things listed in this image are courtesy of ""liberals,"" ""liberals"" are those who prioritize individual liberty over governmental authority, as opposed to ""conservatives,"" who prioritize governmental authority over individual liberty.  Since both Democrats and Republicans prioritize governmental authority over individual liberty, they're both, by the classical definitions, ""conservatives.""

The term ""liberal"" stopped referring to advocates of individual liberty in the US in the wake of the Great Depression, when some number of then ""liberals"" took the position that poverty constrained liberty, so liberty was served by instituting social welfare programs, in spite of the fact that instituting those programs required greatly expanding governmental authority.  When this viewpoint started gaining news coverage, the press attributed it to ""liberals,"" and the characterization stuck.

Not coincidentally, it wasn't long after that that the term ""libertarian"" started to gain popularity, since that became the preferred term to describe those who were formerly known as ""liberals"" - those who advocated individual liberty.  Meanwhile, American ""liberals"" continued to move ever further to the authoritarian left.

At this point, the only thing that distinguishes American ""liberals"" from American ""conservatives"" is which specific policies and powers they want their authoritarian governments to pursue.  Which, again, by the classical usage and the usage still in place in most of the rest of the world, means that both are actually ""conservatives,"" just of two slightly different flavors."

10303,9g2sqt,Progressivism and alt-right are the problems.  Social Liberals and Fiscal Conservitives are the answer or.............Libertarians.  
10304,9g2sqt,"The right and associated media is deviously talented at redefining/rebranding people/terms through using them in negative contexts, regardless of any existing definition or facts. And doing it over, and over, and over until enough of their base eats it up.

This isn't new, but what's scary to see is how central it has become to mainstream conservatism, culminating with Trump. A sitting president whose main weapon during the campaign was, arguably, nicknames and one-liners. I get that that's not exactly what I started with, but my point is the detriment to the electorate. If you can convince someone to redefine a word or person simply because you say so, why wouldn't you be able to convince them that you are going to expand coverage and lower costs simply by saying ""because we're gonna have the best healthcare, the best"". You can't counter that with policy or the reality that a lot of people (minus one very important one) understand ""healthcare can be so complicated"".

The ability to redefine and demonize these terms effectively with a portion of their base opened the door for a campaign that succeeded in part by chanting ""lock her up"", ""build the wall"", and feel good one liners. Which now has opened the door for members of congress and electoral candidates to openly dismiss criticism simply by saying ""fake news"" or ""deep state"".

If that's an effective explanation for enough of the electorate, then we have effectively jumped the shark.

Edit: Don't get me wrong, the left has its own version of this. Obama, especially towards the beginning, ran with a less defined platform than Clinton in 2008 and leaned a bit on a lot of the ""hopey changey stuff"". But, he coalesced the closer the election got, whereas Trump doubled down again and again, and probably won because of it."
10305,9g2sqt,Liberal - good people doing good things. Conservative - bad person doing corrupt things. It's not that hard to figure out.

And the things mentioned are partial changes (rightly). 

1. Vote: 10 year olds still don't vote, because adults decided they are not mature enough. So where is liberalism here?
2. Equality: Partially yeah, but liberalism also blurred the lines between gender roles... which is not good for anyone.
3. Inalienable rights: I am not sure what this even means. Basic human rights? If so, it has little to do with liberalism.
4. Free speech: Do we have full free speech, even when it hurts others? Who gets do decide where to draw the line?
5. Enemy of tyrants: Unless when the tyranny is ""everyone is free and that's that""?

Bottomline, liberalism is mostly based on subjectivity. We need to fight for the things mentioned, but within reason. Conservatism is also not always good, but we need to be conservatives on the collective good."

“What did liberals do that was so offensive to the Republican party? I’ll tell you what they did. Liberals got women the right to vote. 
Liberals got African-Americans the right to vote. Liberals created Social Security and lifted millions of elderly people out of poverty. 
Liberals ended segregation. 
Liberals passed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act. 
Liberals created Medicare. 
Liberals passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. 
What did conservatives do? They opposed them on every one of those things ­- every one. So when you try to hurl that label at my feet, ‘Liberal,’ as if it were something to be ashamed of, something dirty, something to run away from, it won’t work, Senator. Because I will pick up that label and I will wear it as a badge of honor.”"
10386,9g2sqt,"Look up the term.  Heck, look up both terms, liberal and conservative.  How anyone can say they are conservative with pride is shocking to me.  It's literally saying ""I refuse to think openly about problems or in any new way"".  

Liberal thinking gave us the U.S. as a free country, it freed the slaves, it gave women the vote, it gave us civil rights, etc...  

Conservatism might win some battles, and not every liberal idea is inherently ""good"".. but liberal thinking *always* wins the ""war"".   (many, by no means all) Conservatives today would be considered liberal just a generation ago.  

Liberals have to drag conservatives, kicking and screaming into every new generation.  At BEST.. conservatism applies the brakes to some liberal ideas, but it's usually just backward, stagnant, out-of-date thinking.. it's lazy thinking.

Similarly, liberals in the time 1770 and 80's decided they were done with the monarchy and established a Democracy. By today's standards they'd be hyper-conservative, but in their day, they were breaking the mold.

Liberals in the 1860's fought for abolition, but may have been proponents of segregation.

Liberals in the 1960's pushed for civil rights, but condemned gay marriage.

Similarly, liberals in the time 1770 and 80's decided they were done with the monarchy and established a Democracy. By today's standards they'd be hyper-conservative, but in their day, they were breaking the mold."

You see the slavery and women's lib argument on conservative talk all the time. But they always forget to mention the later shift in politics.

10442,9g2sqt,"No, that's the left. While liberals are to the left of center and conservatives are to the right, neither are on the wings and most of their arguments are by matters of degree. A defining characteristic of both the extreme left and right is intolerance to opposing views. The first thing these groups invariably do once they have power is to shut down any opposing voice because they cannot stand to listen to anyone they don't already agree with.

Unfortunately our political system has come to enfranchise wingnuts and discourage the participation of centrists. Liberals and Conservatives are both endangered species. Conservatives have been driven out of their own party by the Trump movement they mistakenly opened the door for.  

It turns out Gerrymandering doesn't make your seat safe at all, it just makes you less vulnerable to other party and far more vulnerable to wingnuts within your own party. It turns out that having a platform of ""kicking out the establishment"" for 20 years was going to be interpreted by ring wing voters to mean kick everyone out, including moderate Republicans.

In response the left has become more engaged and enraged, and they too are forcing liberals out of ""safe"" seats.  The problem is these extremists would rather shoot each other than talk to each other. Listen to the rhetoric some time.

10493,9g2sqt,I can see that. 
10494,9g2sqt,"Well... I can sort of see why you say that, at least in an American context, and it's true to some degree, but it's not quite accurate in the classical sense.

In a quasi-socialist oligarchy, like the former USSR, a supporter of capitalism would likely rightly be considered a liberal, while a supporter of the ""socialism"" that was already in place would likely rightly be considered a conservative.

Again, the classical distinction hinges on how people generally respond to situations in which governmental authority and individual liberty conflict.  If they come down on the side of governmental authority, they're conservatives, and if they come down on the side of individual liberty, they're liberals.

Granted though, to go back, in an American (or arguably most of the western world) context, you're pretty much right, since the ""capitalism"" that's in place is much like the ""socialism"" that was in place in the former USSR - it's really just the specific economic model the government has to work within as it goes about abusing its authority.  It's not quite as overt in the ""capitalism"" of the US as it was in the ""socialism"" of the USSR, but in both cases, what the government is really doing is expanding its own power to the benefit of itself and its cronies and patrons.  It's just that different economic systems require jumping through different sets of hoops in order to accomplish that goal.

And yeah - in some sense at least, it might be argued that opposing ""capitalism"" is a liberal position in the US, just because the ""capitalism"" in the US is so intertwined with and dependent upon authoritarianism.  And I think I could even make a case for a shift toward socialism being a liberal shift, since it would necessarily involve shifting at least some of the government's attention toward the benefit, and arguably even the liberty, of the citizens, as opposed to its longstanding almost single-minded focus on the benefit of itself and its cronies and patrons.

Edit - I just came back out after posting this and noted that I misread your post.  I thought you said that ""if you support capitalism, you aren't liberal.""

Mmm... yeah - I'd tend to say (not 100%, but pretty damned close) that ""left"" at least very strongly implies opposition to capitalism.  I can't really think of a reason to not say it's certain, other than that I'm not certain myself.  I guess there might be an exception, though I can't think of one right off."

What's a fair rate?  What should they be raised too? How do you define that? How much of someone's income should be taxed? 

There needs to be tax reform, without a doubt, I do not disagree. The question is how to go about it? No proposed tax plan, from either party in my mind, has been good enough.

I'm not saying the left doesn't do it, there is absolutely convenient virtue signaling that takes place. I would argue that it is only more recently with Trump and the polarization peak that came with him, that it has become able to actually use a drop of fear though (whereas the right has been doing it [effectively for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy)). However, your comparing a definition of a word that you disagree with (which I would personally argue that there is big ""R"" Racism, the systemic variety, and small ""r"" racism the interpersonal variety, but that's just my opinion), to crafting an entire narrative (deep state, fake news, fucking q anon) and making it a CORE part of your political strategy.

No liberal demonized the term liberal, I've never heard a liberal use the phrase ""the liberal agenda"". It's the same people, or a lot of the same people, that spouted ""the communist/black/homosexual/socialist agenda"", to help create the illusion of a system of power, influence, and control wielded by a marginalized or demonized (or both) group to serve as a scapegoat for fear mongering.

tell that to people like me who can't legally vote or whose votes are irrelevant because of republican gerrymandering and disenfranchisement and electoral college imbalances. the republicans at least understand that in order to implement their policies they have to take power, and as a strategy it's worked great for them and they have just about everything they could want. the point of a party _should_ be to advance its own interests and it can't do that without taking power, so it is necessary that it do that. what exactly do you think the purpose of a political party is if not to advance a specific political agenda?"

I've also always been pretty libertarian on the issues of gay marriage and transgenderism which made me liberal in the eyes of a lot of my religious family (I'm religious too btw just with the belief in free agency).

What made me switch was what I perceived as a shift in their social message which is what really had interested me in the liberalism in the first place. I was interested in the legalization of gay marriage, freedom of information, and freedom of speech. All of those things I perceived to be more strongly represented on the left.  Well, gay marriage was legalized (not in the way I had hoped by ammendment) and the focus began moving towards universal healthcare, enforced speech, free college, etc which were things that I didn't agree with on an economic and/or libertarian basis. I know the Republicans aren't doing any better with the budget right now, but I hope that someone will change that either on the left or the right.

But that doesn't matter as much as what I perceived as a threat to free speech and individual rights, which are some of the things that should unite both sides of the aisle."

10555,9g2sqt,"I'll take a crack at this. The entirety of the logic behind lower taxes is to increase discretionary spending of the average consumer. The problem is that current conservative tendencies for taxes is to provide next to no tax cuts to the average consumer, in order to provide massive tax cuts to the people that don't ""need"" it. We need more tax brackets for the insanely wealthy. The highest tax bracket is reached at roughly 500k income. As of 2012, the top 400 incomes in the US averaged $335.7 million. Taxes cap out at 37% for anything beyond 500k. We should have tax brackets that grow all the way up to the 100's of millions, and should be plateauing in the realm of 80% at around $250 million. I know people view that as essentially expecting the rich to pay for everything for the poor, but there is a point where the extremely rich are simply not paying their fair share. I use fair share in a very loose sense, mostly under the idea that their quality of life is no longer being increased with more income, while their own employees are still barely getting by. The fact that people think fair taxes are having  people that make $500,001 and $400,000,000 in the same tax bracket is utterly insane.  That means there are people that literally make 800x as much money as people in the same tax bracket. That is the equivalent of people making minimum wage and people making $5,800 an hour being in the same tax bracket. Alongside this, we want to keep corporate tax rates low and strictly require disclosure of business expenditures in an attempt to prevent the mega rich from using corporate expenditures as personal spending. There needs to be incentive to have the mega rich put their money back into their business rather than reaching incomes of $1 million a day. I dont necessarily want to be punishing the rich, but there is a point when you're making so much money that you're essentially operating purely on greed. We need to start paying down our national debt, and investing money in things like universal health care. "

I'd say the left greatly exaggerates marginalization, at the VERY least on a systemic level, and uses their exaggerations as a tool to facilitate ad-hominem attacks on political opponents/people who disagree. likely the truth is somewhere in the middle seeing as racists do exist and a politically active black/socialist/etc.. would have a black/socialist/etc.. agenda just by nature of being a politically active black/socialist/etc.  Obviously a liberal wouldn't demonize a term they identify with, they just strayed from what most would consider ""classical liberalism"", towards stances the right would find objectionable while still keeping the name.  To me classical liberalism is anti-authoritarianism, while modern liberalism is just leftism.

Then you should edit that to say ""Not the kind the Southern Democrats believed in 50+ years ago"".

The argument that the ""Democrats were the party of slavery"" or opposed the CRA is never made in a vacuum (that I've heard at least) and by implication is attempting to reframe that shadow onto the current party.

When in reality, it is a geographical area that has historically been the heart of those issues/running counter to progress. An area that in modern times typically votes Republican and is typically more conservative.

In fact, the five states that supported Wallace have voted red every presidential since 2000. And most of them since '76 (the only blue candidates to break through at all were both Southerners, Carter in '72 and Clinton somewhat 20 years later).

Peddling this nonsense without providing the larger context that gives it any modern viability is intellectually lazy at best, intellectually dishonest at worst. And is very much related to OP's post. In how something can just be repeated and repeated, until it is redefined and then regurgitated."

10576,9g2sqt,"Rallying for the advancement of your belief is not the same as crushing those who believe differently. 

The Founders cautioned against the establishment of parties because they feared that form of thinking. They understood that a popular and well organized political machine could run elections and erode democracy. We can see that happening now with the DNC favoritism showed towards certain candidates, and the republican endorsement of criminal activity to further their ends. Both parties are incredibly flawed (although it seems like the republicans are worse).

The point of a party is to bring fractured voters under the fold so 16 candidates with similar viewpoints don't rob votes from each other. As a party you agree that no one person can possibility represent everyone, so you vote en masse for the candidates who's platforms best covers your broad views. At least that's what I was taught in my highschool civics class.

A voters allegiance is supposed to be to their own conscious, not blind party dogma. That's why respect for the minority is important. People's views can change and you may find your party on the losing side of an election. That doesn't mean the other party can say, pass a law forbidding your party. 

I don't know why you've been disenfranchised, but I have to assume it was for reasonable cause and not just because your political viewpoint is unpopular. Why? Because we aren't, as a society, in the habit of disenfranchising voters because we don't agree with them."

10598,9g2sqt,"So let's say I pay $10,000 in taxes on a yearly basis, that is roughly 15% on a $70,000 salary. Somebody that makes $100M, at our current rate of 37%, pays $37M in taxes. That is 3700% more than me. Is that not fair share enough?  In your example of 80% at $250M, that number increases to 20000% more. Is that better?  What actually defines fair share?  How much is it?  As I said, there needs to be tax reform, I do not disagree with this. Maybe increasing the number of tax brackets is part of the solution, but on top of that loopholes in the tax law need to be closed as well, and perhaps take away tax breaks too, but then do you only take away the tax breaks from the rich, or to make it fair, take them away from everybody?

What's stopping people from taking less money to run a company? Instead of a salary of $100M, they take a salary of $100,000, with the rest being in stock options, something that has no taxable value until sold? And if sold sparingly enough, now we are back to the same problem, super rich not paying enough in taxes, because now their income is much less than it was previously. The rich didn't get to that point by being stupid, and they will always try and find a way to skirt paying anymore than they legally have to. And if you start taxing investment accounts on something that hasn't been sold, then you need to tax them for everybody, not just the rich, and all that does is hurt the common person by giving them another tax burden, as well. 

I agree that incomes are outrageous at times, and in your example of 80% at $250M, they would still net $50M, which is more than enough for anybody to retire on after only working for a year, and that it does account to greed at a certain point.

I really wish there was a very simple cut and dry answer to this so it could be implemented, but because of how this country is run, I don't believe it to be possible, not without getting everybody that is currently sitting in government out and replacing them entirely. But that poses it's own problems as well, and is near impossible to do. "

10602,9g2sqt,"I appreciate a thoughtful response. My goal here is to try and broaden my scope in order to focus my beliefs/values, ideally to draw closer to whatever ""truth"" there is.

I won't lay claim to either left or right having a moral high-ground. I would claim there are at least two kind of ""backdoors"" into someone's heart/gut. Fear and hope. Both can easily be misplaced and taken advantage of. But, I would argue that evolutionarily, fear is the larger and more effective button, to our peril.

As far as ad-hominem attacks, I won't deny that it does happen on the left as a convenient scapegoat to vilify an opponent or redirect focus. But, do you truly believe that the left does it more effectively/often than the right/Trump? Personally, I don't see the evidence for that. Again, when it comes to the left, we are discussing a single aspect, the idea of racism/race and its prevalence/effect. When it comes to the right/Trump, we are talking about entire narratives being crafted to conveniently move the goal posts, at best. Give supporters an out from using the same metrics they criticized Obama/hillary for, here comes ""fake news"" and ""deep state"". As the swamp gets thicker, it takes even more crafting via q-anon and I'm assuming others like that.

My point was that, until more recently, I had not heard as much from the left as much as the right, when it came to using arguably neutral terms ""the x agenda"" in inherently negative contexts. The right has been far more effective at this for decades, as I mentioned. The Southern Strategy and it's descendents is not a joke and is not uneffective politically. We are only recently seeing anything that could be considered a parallel on the left (basket of deplorables etc), or I would challenge you to present me with one that isn't anti-war during Bush, because all the sudden that's cool now.

Just so you know, not every person that isn't a conservative bases their whole worldview on their emotions instead of facts. Just because some public institutions are also disallowing white-nationalists doesn't mean my whole argument is bunk. 

Aside from that, there is some speech which we don't need to give a platform too (and that doesn't mean we should censor it). I don't blame universities for not wanting to host people who are essentially professional propagandists, and whose speech will invite violence which harms minorities. Do you honestly think we should try and have a ""reasoned debate"" with people like Richard Spencer that literally think that black people are genetically inferior and should be deported and killed? Of course not! No matter how much reason you show these people, they aren't changing their minds. Their opinions aren't even based on facts in the first place and by hosting them you're only perpetuating terrible ideas that will get people hurt. There are no upsides."

You also are not accurately portraying tax brackets. Capping the tax bracket at 80% at 250 million means that all money after that 250 million is taxed at 80%. Someone who only made 70 thousand and someone who made 250 million will pay the exact same taxes on that first 70k. Tax brackets only apply to the income that falls within the increment of that bracket. So someone who made 250 million pre taxes would end up making far more than 50 million after taxes. 


The problem with arguing that the rich will always find a way to avoid paying the taxes is that you're essentially stating that any change in taxes is irrelevant and therefore we should not increase them, thusly benefitting the rich. "

At a much slower pace (too slow unfortunately), more left-leaning social democrats are pulling off some unlikely victories. The politically-engaged youth of the party are fully embracing this and aren't scared of anti-socialist propaganda anymore but need to pump their overall numbers up to push out the old, centrist establishment guard.

10641,9g2sqt,"I don't think you read my statement, or maybe I did not make myself clear which is entirely possible. I do not believe we should give a platform to anyone who believes any race, creed, sex, gender, etc. is inferior. I take no issue with campuses shutting people like that out. I do take issue with people being protested, interrupted, silenced, who have opinions and thoughts that differ from yours or mine. It is incredibly important that we listen to people who we don't agree with, outside of aforementioned bigots. It's just those types of people; those with differing thoughts that are being shut up. THAT IS DANGEROUS, history has taught us that.

To your initial point, I absolutely believe fact is superior to feelings or emotions. Stoicism is core to my belief system and I give absolutely no leniency to anyone who decides that their feeling or emotions are more important than facts or others opinions. You and I have the absolute human right to our feelings, that does not mean they must be respected by others. It is not convenient it is essential that facts, logic and valid arguments override feelings. I also never said nor do I believe that any one ideology uses facts, feelings, emotions, etc more than another.  I simply believe that your initial statement was in no way based on fact.  It happens everywhere not just private or public campuses, it is not  singularly maniacs or bigots that are being silenced and it is absolutely free speech that is being silenced, if you do not see that you are not paying attention.

I believe the term white nationalists is convenient. It's broad and poorly defined. Call them what they are racists, but do not lump people in because they believe in strict immigration policy. It does not matter if I agree with them, what matters is that we have a discussion and we come to some kind of consensus because it is not republicans who are hurting illegal or legal immigrants it is all of us. We can help those who would like to come to our nation by coming to a consensus, reforming law, and sticking to it. If we shut each other up we will NEVER comprise.

Simply put, your argument is bunk because it is in totality bunk. However, I respect the hell out of you for having conviction and what seems to be deeply rooted feeling and emotions towards the betterment of a nation and those who inhabit it. That is what we need, people with conviction, people who are willing to stand up and make themselves heard. On the internet, in public, everywhere.

To finish off this rant that nobody will likely read, and those who do will probably disagree with. I respect all valid arguments, I respect anyone who is willing to defend their beliefs, I do not respect your feelings nor will I ever. People are allowed to believe and defend what they believe in, but don't fucking tell someone they can't speak because they hurt someone else's fucking feelings. That's childish and unproductive. Again, and it is insane that I have to explicitly say this, I don't believe in gay bashing, or racism, or any other form of hate and I do not believe we should give people who intend to insight hate or violence a platform.

As it currently stands, everybody tries to pay as little in taxes as they possibly can, the rich, poor and middle class alike.  It's just in our nature to keep what we earn and not want to give it away. The current tax law needs a complete overhaul, rebuilt from the ground up so that everybody does pay their fair share, and that is an undertaking I don't envy for anyone. Everybody has their own opinion on it, and is one of the reasons it hasn't been done, nobody can agree on anything.

We seem to be pretending the Republican party at large is not immensely pleased with Trump. Kicking a guy the majority of their party wanted in the white house out is huge gamble.

Trump is not an aberration of the Republican party, he's just a Republican without the mask or Lee Atwater filter.

All indication seems to be that the dems will win a few seats in the house in 2018 that nets them no advantage, but that the Republican party will not only have 1-3 additional seats in the senate (which means healthcare will be an easy vote) but will also potentially have enough officials for a constitutional convention, [which they really really want to do.](https://www.google.com/search?q=republican+constitutional+convention&oq=republican+constitutional+convention&aqs=chrome..69i57.3896j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)"

But it seems that if it ever becomes clear that the GOP is bleeding votes from the center-right faster than it's gaining them from the far-right, the GOPers in congress will have to reevaluate the strategy.

10732,75gw1x,"I'm glad it's just your opinion.  I'm strongly in favor for term limits.

There is no need for someone to spend 20+ years using their position to stay in power.

A majority of people like *their* federal representation, but an overwhelming majority of people view the federal representation as a whole as ineffective.

It's ineffective because instead of doing stuff for the country or state, they are doing to stay in their position.  They posture and pander directly to their electorate.  "
10733,75gw1x,"I mean, you couls vote them out. Term limits arent an issue if people go out and vote"

I mean, if they are delivering what their district wants, that's ideal. 

>A majority of people like their federal representation, but an overwhelming majority of people view the federal representation as a whole as ineffective.

This is because they all have competing wants, which I feel like you're missing. 

>It's ineffective because instead of doing stuff for the country or state, they are doing to stay in their position. They posture and pander directly to their electorate.

They're not representatives of the country, they are representatives of their constituents, that's kind of the point. You're literally describing how it's supposed to work: Rep 'panders' to their district on behalf of what that district wants in order to stay in power. What you seem to like is a system where arbitrarily lame duck sessions are increased giving reps the ability to sell out to lobbying groups and private interests since there's no point not doing it at that time. 

The Senate existing is a far bigger problem irt how our federal government functions than term limits ever could be. "
10740,75gw1x,"Term limits are an easy scapegoat. How does someone learn the nuances  of the legislative process, build working relationships with fellow congress members, how does someone really learns the ins and outs of the policy areas they are assigned to oversee? 

Some members may be bad but if they represent their constituents and continue to get re-elected by the people they represent and advocate for their interests. What is gained from their term limits? 

It makes sense for Presidents or Governors because that could lead to lack of consistent enough change to prevent corruption becoming permanently engrained. "

Yeah, I literally cited Gallup for a reason, you're citing a poll about a month old and uses 33% fewer respondents than gallup. The Gallup numbers I provided are about 2-7 days old. It's 38 right now. 

[If you don't believe me, here's 538's aggregate of all approval ratings putting it at 37.4](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/)

>And just because the Republican Base loves him doesn't mean he's not an aberration. 

His policies are not an aberration, nor is his love of culture war stuff. He's basically just a normal republican with the mask of 'respectability' removed.

>And just because the Republican Base loves him doesn't mean he's not an aberration. Hitler's base loved Hitler. I honestly can't understand why anyone would support him at this point. 

That's your issue, your judgement is clouded by a narrative you REALLY want to believe, that no one could REALLY support the guy. 

>He lies constantly, cannot get Congress to do anything without an executive order 

[He passed more individual bills in his first 100 days than Obama did.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/27/sean-spicer/trump-has-signed-more-bills-100-days-any-president/) While he's passed fewer 'important' bills, Obama got to ride a national wave of support due to the 2008 crash. There's zero reason to think he's not getting a ton done right now, especially because as president his job only really requires signing stuff. The house has already successfully voted to kill Dodd Frank for example, and it'll hit the senate at some point. [In fact, Republicans in the actual government are VERY happy Trump owns every headline because it lets them get a TON done behind the scenes and no one cares because Trump is the entire focus.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/what-trump-is-actually-accomplishing/535458/)

Combine this with the fact every indication we have seems to point to losing 1-3 senate seats to the republicans in 2018 due purely to placement (while losing a few house seats they don't even need), and the party will love him even more. 

>and even high ranking Republicans are distancing themselves from him.

You used plural here, who other than Corker is openly going after him in Republican leadership?

Again, it's real attractive to believe that the base of the Republican party doesn't love Trump, but they do. 

**Think of Obama and how you felt when he got elected. Think of your perception of the situation.**

**Now realize that [Trump](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) had a 1% higher in party approval rating on his day of inauguration than [Obama](http://news.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx).**

Obama had a much higher rating across the board, but you should realize how skewed your perception is when you make claims like ""Republicans at large are jumping ship because he's ruining the party!"" because other than a few outliers, they're all very very happy to own 3/3 branches of the federal government and let Trump be a whipping boy for the press so they can ransack everything not bolted to the floor."
10743,75gw1x,"[They don't](https://www.cbpp.org/research/states-likely-could-not-control-constitutional-convention-on-balanced-budget-amendment-or), just like the original CC they get to write their own rules and procedures once in:

>A convention could choose a new ratification process.  The 1787 convention ignored the ratification process under which it was established and created a new process, lowering the number of states needed to approve the new Constitution and removing Congress from the approval process.  The states then ignored the pre-existing ratification procedures and adopted the Constitution under the new ratification procedures that the convention proposed.  Given these facts, it would be unwise to assume that ratification of the convention’s pro­posals would necessarily require the approval of 38 states, as the Constitution currently specifies.  For example, a convention might remove the states from the approval process entirely and pro­pose a national referendum instead.  Or it could follow the example of the 1787 convention and lower the required fraction of the states needed to approve its proposals from three-quarters to two-thirds.
"
10744,75gw1x,"You have a choice between two candidates, and they would both be anti-Trump (if he were impeached). I'm asserting that you would not vote for anyone who impeaches Trump."
10745,75gw1x,"You'd be right, except that a not insignificant percentage of the time incumbents win. There is a strict advantage to winning a district just because you are the incumbent. An incumbent essentially has to anger their base to get removed, else why the hell would congress have such a huge disapproval rating across the nation?

If there was some way to remove that advantage, such as thoroughly educating our populace, and convincing them that voting isn't just something you do when you're unhappy, then term limits wouldn't be needed. 

Sadly, we're not going to get that, so Term limits should be enforced. The Senate has a built-in system that allows for junior senators to gain experience, with the 1/3 rotation. The term limit doesn't have to be something dumb like Cali did initially, it can be 3 or 4 terms in the Senate, 6-7 in the House. That gives a ""good"" Senator/Representative 12-18/12-14 years to make a difference, and would prevent the worst from staying in power through inertia, to the point of dementia. "
10746,75gw1x,Lol yeah and they can tear apart the country doing that. So yeah GL with that
10747,75gw1x,"I don't understand.  I only have one congressman and 2 senators, if my Republican congressman helps remove Trump how do I vote for a democrat congressman that got rid of him?  "
10748,75gw1x,"It'd also be inherently undemocratic and increase the number of lame duck sessions immensely. It would almost unanimously hurt small states like Hawaii that often get GREAT representation that's consistent for them, and all it would do is slow things down and increase horse trading. 

The house having to get re-elected every 2 years does infinitely more harm than incumbent power. 

It should also be pointed out that a lot of incumbency power has nothing to do with the seat actually giving power, but rather with opposition parties refusing to put real resources behind opposing candidates. "
10749,75gw1x,I'm not sure you 'get' the Republican party. 
10750,75gw1x,"You vote out the Republican senator if he's not pushing impeachment now. He's not doing what you want.

We took in a foster child that two citizens  could not care for and over the years we used many of these services at various times without which we would not have been able to affored to raise this baby now a child. So now my husband's citizenship may be denied  because we participated in a socially beneficial program which we were encouraged to take part in receiving financial aid and where as if we had never taken in this (beautiful, amazing) child there would be no conflict of interest, although who knows what the wellbeing of said child would have been. But if something should happen to my husband and were he to be deported now because they are making up any reason at this point (he has a clean record; we both do) I would have to file for bankruptcy and raise two children on my own (we had one child before we took in our foster baby)... you can bet I'd have to resort to financial support.

He's a date rapist who picked a different target.

Trump is easier to work out: he hates Obama like something out of a comic book and volumes will be written trying to figure out why. I'm actually not sure what I think he'd do with his time if Obama had never existed; I think his diet of nonstop cheeseburgers might have killed him twenty years ago if his bile towards black America hadn't kept getting him out of bed. But he's unfocused; he just likes throwing rocks at things because he never grew out of being a playground bully. Miller is smarter and more dangerous because he affects policy. Trump wouldn't think of half this shit without people like Miller, which is why it's so desperately important to vote in the midterms.

There's no sense in asking ""How about this"" questions. If the scenario involves a person who is poor, non-white or in any sense a ""foreigner,"" the administration—which is demonstrably less Trump than it is Trump's unelected advisors—has pretty clearly told you where it stands."

The plain undeniable fact is that social support like food stamps exist to serve people at a disadvantage, and people at an economic disadvantage tend to be people at a social disadvantage—i.e. people who don't look like Stephen Miller. This shitstrip doesn't have to be standing on the roof of the White House screaming the word ""nigger"" for every motivation behind every one of his policies to be nakedly, flagrantly racist. He wants to stain immigrants who have legally used social supports with a kind of scarlet letter just for being poor. It's every rich white man's argument against everyone else: if they receive a certain kind of benefit, they must be scamming *me.* Never mind my own benefits, which don't come in the form of food stamps but are nonetheless present, and practically innumerable. It might look like economic elitism at a glance, but trust that it's racism. That same guy is using 23andme to ooh and ahh at his family's rich history, but fuck the black dude from Somalia who just fled a war zone to keep his kids alive.

Deciding that people who are following a legal inroad to citizenship and have used social support on the way are now going to be barred will affect some people who look like Stephen Miller (and, I imagine, you). But by and large it will impact people who don't, and at this point the administration's attitude toward immigrants—essentially an institutional obsession with Mexicans and muslims—is so unapologetically biased that it's comical to pretend that there's any sort of blind justice behind it. Stephen Miller is rich white America: I'm in, pull up the rope."
10874,95q3yh,"Do you honestly think racists never have any excuses for their views or actions?

You'd believe a lynch mob if they just told you they were ""protecting their community"" right?

10909,95q3yh,"I was basing this off your last line that ""not like anyone is entitled to immigration."" since this discussion was on citizenship for people already legally immigrated.  

We have a legal setup for people to become citizens and when we play fast and loose with the already established rules, we look weak. 

""Here's what it takes to become a citizen.""   
""Well okay that seems rea-""  
""Actually here's what it takes.""  
""Wait you just said tha--""  
""Nevermind, here's what it takes.""  
""Hold on, you said--""  
""Actually just go home.""

Phew. Glad my grandparents, or yours, or Stephen Millers never had to go through this."
10910,95q3yh,"It doesn't say ""lower priority"" - it says they can be rejected entirely, if they OR their (U.S. citizen) family/spouse happened to - at any time, for whatever reason - use ACA, food stamps, or children's health insurance program. 

That means foreign spouses of many state & federal employees. That means foreign spouses of junior military personnel whose pay is so terrible they routinely go on food stamps. 

That means foreign relatives of any self-employed business owner who had a bad year, who was on food stamps years ago while single, or people who lost homes & jobs due to bank fraud or natural disasters or recession. 

This affects MILLIONS of families - NOT just new immigrants, and not the fictional ""welfare queens"" they like to scapegoat. "
10911,95q3yh,"People can. Monsters can't! 

Twitler, and all his *best* people are monsters. The Republicans have set their own base up to be this hate-filled crazy for the last 45 years. 

And if you think all this is bad.... I'll let you in on a secret...that should be incredibly*huge* news: all of Twitler is a distraction from something even bigger and scarier, the Kock brothers have been setting up state houses in an effort to get a constitutional convention. Yup. Not since 1776 have we had what they want to do. They want to fundamentally change our country. They currently have 27 of the 34 states they need to pull it off....and I worry that the impeachment and arrest of Twitler & Co. Will set the hair on fire of the other state republicans they need....and next thing you know we have a civil war.... or sucession....but this time it will be the Blue States that succeed from the union... 

If conservatives get this far, we are going to have to kill them. "
10912,95q3yh,"True... but I think it will go past that. But yes, that seems like a consistent starting point based on their actions against legal immigrants. "
10913,95q3yh,"So immigration law can never be reformed? 

Seems like a reasonable policy to me. You want to incentivise people to be self sufficient. "
10914,95q3yh,"I agree they should be clearly articulated and followed guidelines, and that changing those guidelines should be done carefully and as rarely as needed.

But they aren't immutable guidelines. I think having an adaptive immigration policy could be helpful in the event of economic downturn. There are a few ways that could happen in the near future, worth having a discussion on what lengths we are willing to go to in order to safeguard our economy.

There is a real human cost to these sorts of budget cuts, but that doesn't mean there isn't merit to the argument that we can be more economically stringent in terms of our immigration policy. I don't necessarily agree with his proposal in entirety, especially since it may result in people who need these benefits avoiding taking them out of fear of delaying citizenship.

In general, if we could have a better paths for people to get themselves off of welfare, these sorts of issues might solve themselves... Unfortunately it's easier to just make simple sweeping solutions than campaign for complex and comprehensive change.

Not an economist or immigration expert by any means, so these are just surface thoughts."
10915,95q3yh,"It makes sense for them. 21.3% of the US relies on monthly social programs. That's mainly divided into two groups. The elderly and the poor. Poor are mainly democrat voters and can't advance much without them, Elderly are mainly republican voters and don't need college loans. To the elderly you can frame it as cutting reckless spending, redirecting money towards those it can help more, etc, and they'll eat it up. This is how R's think. "
10916,7po8ty,"I do not want another celebrity president. If she is serious about running for President, she should run for a local office (mayor, governor, senator/representative, etc) first to gain executive political experience then run for President. "
10917,7po8ty,"She's already said no, why are we still talking about this?"
10918,7po8ty,That's all we need is another billionaire narcissist that puts their name on everything in the White House.
10919,7po8ty,"The more you talk about her like she's a candidate, the more credibility she gets.  We wouldn't have Trump right now if the media didn't spend a whole year bombarding us with news of his campaign."
10920,7po8ty,Two words: The Secret. 
10921,7po8ty,I guess the 2020 election season has begun.  So ridiculous. 
10922,7po8ty,"Oprah's appointees: Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz, Jenny McCarthy, Gayle King, Stedman Graham, and a star-studded list of Hollywood elite. Get the fuck out of here! Have we learned nothing from the past year? No more TV stars!"
10923,7po8ty,"I'd gage my interest in Oprah as president slightly higher than Trump, but only because she is actually successful through her own deeds and didn't ride the coat tails of daddy's money.  
But even with that, she isn't really qualified. Dems, please look elsewhere. 
"
10924,7po8ty,Yeahhh she's great at getting people to cry on TV but I'm guessing she is not a policy wonk in her spare time. 
10925,7po8ty,Can we have someone that actually knows something about the law?? This is so fucking dumb.
10926,7po8ty,I think Oprah 2020 is more about a foil and click bait for conservatives than anything serious.
10927,7po8ty,Are you people insane?! This is the last thing needed. 
10928,7po8ty,NO more amateurs; she should stick to show biz.

10930,7po8ty,Uhm no.
10931,7po8ty,"Please, no more celebrity presidents.

Being famous is not a qualification to hold office.  Albeit, she is the head of a corporation and that entitles her to administration experience, but enough with the idea that business people know how to run a country."
10932,7po8ty,"Why the fuck are people taking this seriously? Oprah **didn't** say she was going to run, it was a joke made by someone else! The only people who took this seriously where right wing pundits screaming about the hypocrisy of it and now suddenly left leaners are talking about it as if it's going to happen too! "

10936,7po8ty,"America needs a principled, highly educated, progressive president who's not a fucking billionaire or a celebrity.  "
10937,7po8ty,"I'm not sure there is anything that would compel me to vote for Oprah in a general election, and absolutely not in a primary.  Even in an Oprah vs Trump matchup, that would probably be enough for me to vote 3rd party or abstain. 

Part of me hopes that this silliness surrounding Oprah breaks down any ""identity politics"" argument and makes room for a run by **Kamala Harris.**  How awesome would it be for two black women engaged in a primary debate to be recognized for their ideas rather than their identities?"
10938,7po8ty,Why are people taking this rumor seriously? She specifically said she had no plans to run.
10939,7po8ty,"We do not need another rich celebrity running for office. Someone who has literally zero experience in the field is fucking ridiculous. 

Also fuck trump."
10940,7po8ty,"Has anyone else laid awake at night thinking about how maybe we lost because we were all a little ""too sure"" that Hillary would win? I mean, I went out and voted, but a lot of people that I know were checked out because they were just so confident that Hillary had the election in the bag, that their help at the polls simply wasn't needed.

I recognize that my experience is anecdotal, but if I'm not alone in noticing this then I think anyone we pick for the 2020 election will be a surefire win, as this time around people won't be stupid enough to stay home instead of visiting the polls. I truly believe that if more people voted, we would see Hillary's win by voter count dramatically higher than it actually ended up being.

That being said, I don't want Oprah, we already have enough TV stars in office, we need someone who is more experienced."
10941,7po8ty,"Let's be honest, we're all voting for whoever the democrat is because republicans are nuts, but we do not need a celebrity for our candidate!"
10942,7po8ty,"Please, no."

10944,7po8ty,Please no.

10946,7po8ty,FOISTED!
10947,7po8ty,"How about Oprah for ambassador? I'm fine with that. I think she'd be good at it. 

Just say no to celebrity politicians."
10948,7po8ty,"Oprah is all about ""If you want it bad enough, go out and get it yourself. If I can do it, ANYBODY can do it"". She'll apply that to wages, healthcare, love, family, food, clothing, shelter, not getting abused, and so on. I've never viewed her as a sharing, caring person. I don't think she's very loving or genuine. It was all about ratings. She's turned blame into ""personal accountability"". "
10949,7po8ty,"Please, someone just give us a candidate with experience in the executive branch, who is intelligent, empathetic and genuinely will fight for the interest of the American people."
10950,7po8ty,Getting really hostile really fast. Are you really trying to make Oprah into a bad person when she's not even running? 
10951,7po8ty,NOprah

10953,7po8ty,"Fuck Trump and fuck Oprah.

And fuck pretty much all celebrities wanting to lead a fucking country without being qualified."
10954,7po8ty,There isn't a shred of evidence that Oprah Winfrey is going to try to run for president.  She did her job and gave a good speech at the Golden Globes.  
10955,7po8ty,"""Dr."" Phil.  I remember, Winfrey.  I remember the years you spent using that shitbag as a prop for male validation.  

You're not escaping your own shit.  Run for congress, prove you have the chops for anything other than self-promotion. "
10956,7po8ty,"You know what Oprah doesn't want?

She doesn't want the international humiliation of losing to Donald Trump.

10978,7po8ty,The fact that she was running for 2020 was a hoax. Proven to be false. I'd advice doing a bit more research
10979,7po8ty,Why is politician the only job people don’t think you have to have experience for?

10985,7po8ty,We can't discount all the good works she's done.  Like funding those girls schools in Africa where students are taught valuable lessons in how to endure a beating in silence and being a complaint victim of sexual abuse.
10986,7po8ty,Don't forget Sr Phil and the plagarist and the school on Africa that turned into essentially a rape factory 
10987,7po8ty,Celebrities are starting to do more harm than good for the democratic party (they have certainly helped in the past). And I think it will only get worse. I wanted to tear my fucking eyes out when Hillay put Lena Dunham front and center.

10994,7po8ty,ARE YOU RACIST!?! 
10995,7po8ty,Ugh. That's what my first thought was when I heard this.  The second was WERE ALL GETTING A CAAAAARRRR that we wont be able to keep because of the taxes..

10997,7po8ty,Oh please no.  No.  Where the ‘sassins??
10998,7po8ty,My goodness that website is cringey. Witch hunts on every slight remark from a celeb
10999,7po8ty,"And yet Trump sexually attacked 20 women and confessed to hitting on married women and grabbing them by the pussy. If you don't like people Oprah introduced the world to, don't vote for them but it doesn't reflect on Oprah. Neither Oz nor McCarthy is a Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort. "
11000,7po8ty,We need experienced political leadership to steer us out of the shithole that the republicans have dug for us.  Oprah should never consider a run for public office.  She’s good at her business but would be ruinous for the country.
11001,7po8ty,The ultimate peddler of garbage.. anyone remember the Celestine Prophecy? 
11002,7po8ty,I'm sure she would be better than a Republican. But I'm definitely not voting for her in the primary.
11003,7po8ty,"AND YET

She's still light years better than the incompetent treasonous troll we currently have in the White House  So yeah, she'd get my vote in any contest between the two"
11004,7po8ty,So who are some potential candidates? Please don’t say Sanders. Biden would be acceptable but he is pretty old.

11006,7po8ty,"Dear Liberals and Independents  
  &nbsp;  
In 2020, there will be a candidate competing against Donald Trump for President. It is very likely this candidate:  
  &nbsp;  
* Isn't your first choice  
* Isn't 100% ideologically pure  
* Has made mistakes in their life  
* Might not really excite you all that much  
* Has ideas you are uncomfortable with  
  &nbsp;  
Please start the process of getting over that shit now, instead of waiting until 2020."
11007,7po8ty,There's nothing that seriously suggests that Oprah wants to hold public office. Can't we let black people have a moment and appreciate someone who has been successful for 10 minutes before we find a way to jump in and be critical?
11008,7po8ty,"fuck, thank you.  I'll vote for her over Trump only because I'd vote for a sentient peanut over Trump.

But if it's Winfrey v Trump 2020, my life goal will be getting my family on SpaceX rocket to Mars as soon as possible."
11009,7po8ty,"Seriously, why aren't we pushing for Former First Lady Obama to run?"
11010,7po8ty,Lock her up!

11012,7po8ty,"The problem here is that you would need someone who would appeal to the masses, you won't win on experience, reason, intelligence, coming sense. You will need someone more popular than DT. She is honestly your only option without her 2020 is going to Trump in a landslide. "
11013,7po8ty,Just sad that here in the Seattle area we have the largest community of people that don't vaccinate (Vashon Island) so I'm particularly sensitive to this issue.  The Party should stand for forcing parents to do things to kids rather than allowing freedom.
11014,7po8ty,"No no no no no no no nooooo! No more celebs.

#elonmusk2020 "
11015,7po8ty,"And then renounce all the shitty things she's promoted and done. Even after that, I don't think I'd vote for her. She's pushed too much crap that I think she even knew was bullshit."
11016,7po8ty,America will turn into Idiocracy real quick if we continue the trend of electing celebrities. 
11017,7po8ty,"I don't think I can dismiss *anything* anymore after Trump, but so far I haven't really heard anyone express support for an Oprah run outside of some corners of Reddit."
11018,7po8ty,Yes!!! Thank you i’ve been saying this into what feels like a gaping black hole of idiocy. 
11019,7po8ty,"Why does it seem like only Dems can think objectively about a potential candidate--celebrity or otherwise? Reps saw Trump and thought ""Republican? Celebrity?? Let's do this!""

But most Democratic threads I've seen have been pretty hesitant to jump on any Oprah bandwagon. I'm not sure if it's *only* the fact that we've seen Trump's history or if Dems *actually* research the candidate before voting.

All the while, Republican subs haven't wasted a moment in blaming Dem subs for jumping on the ""Oprah bandwagon,"" which isn't true.

Coming from a Conservative (albeit non-Trump-voter), I thank you."
11020,7po8ty,"Arnold Schwarzenegger 4 prez????
"
11021,7po8ty,"I'm pro-Oprah presidency.  Among other pluses, she hand picked Obama, and he would be a good guide for her at least. 

Among other pluses, while all her moves over decades in the spotlight have not been the best, you do not build a multi billion dollar empire (without an inheritance from your father) by being a complete idiot.  

Modern America is a lot more than just government - it's okay to elect smart people without explicitly government experience.  There's no school you can go to that will prepare you to govern 320 million people in a world of 7-8 billion.  "
11022,7po8ty,"This should be the top comment, it's just ridiculous at this point."
11023,7po8ty,Because the media want us to keep talking about it.

Oprah comes from nothing. Is actually self made. Has schools in Africa, gave away hundreds of thousands worth of gifts on the Oprah show. Compared to Trump she doesn't put her name on everything. A show and network based off of a legendary show? stop it.

- Mike Bloomberg and Mark Zuckerberg might be running

- Tom Steyer is running tv ads to impeach Trump, maybe he'll go the full distance and run? 

- Warren Buffet is famously liberal and extremely respected

- Jamie Dimon is a Democrat. He'd take some warming up because Wall St., but he's outstandingly well-spoken, outspoken, smart, and handsome to boot (which does matter in elections). He's also, actually, genuinely, demonstrably a great business leader.

11037,7po8ty,"Naw. Louis Black was on the Late Night with Seth Meyers show earlier this week doing his usual angry yelling bit and he complained about the media saying ""Oprah's *thinking* about running.

11056,7po8ty,😔 I'd really like Biden
11057,7po8ty,The fact that Trump did or was accused of doing (trying not to make any claims) some fucked up stuff has nothing to do with the fact that Oprah would be a bad presidential candidate. His actions do not set a precedent that lets other people with bad backgrounds instantly be seen as acceptable candidates.
11058,7po8ty,"I've heard a lot of talk about Sen. Sherrod Brown, Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand, Sen. Cory Booker, and Gov. Roy Cooper. I'm not crazy about the prospects the Democrats are facing but, hey, I guess we could be in a much worse situation right now. "
11059,7po8ty,"Great point!  I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite choosing Sanders in the primary.  And I also voted for John Kerry despite choosing Kucinich in the primary.  But let's expand your wonderful point.

1) Just admit that you're talking to the 28% of Hillary Clinton supporters who voted for McCain/Palin in 2008.  After all, in 2016, only 12% of Sanders supporters voted for Republicans.  Clinton supporters were much more prone to the behavior you decry.

2) I get it.  You thought that Obama ""stole"" the nomination from Her in 2008 http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/documentary_claims_obama_campa.html  I'm not persuaded by those arguments, but even if they're true and Hillary Clinton wants to run again - which is her perfect right - let's not pre-select a candidate years in advance of the '20 primary https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774, let's have an open primary and evaluate all candidates.

3) If candidate A polls ten points better against Trump than candidate B, let's take that into consideration, and let's not make arguments that ""the polls will suddenly reverse if Candidate A is selected.""

4) When good progressive ideas are strongly popular, let's run on those ideas.  Compromise is only rational when it helps to win an election.  Al Gore didn't run on legal gay marriage in 2000, but if it had had 65% public support at that time, it would have made sense for him to do that.  ""Centrist"" means what people in the center want.  

5) Let's think long and hard before nominating another candidate with 60% disapproval rating.  Of course the 2016 election was close, because both candidates had 60% disapproval.  But if either party had thought of running a more popular candidate, it might have been less close.

So let's work together, have a spirited, competitive primary, choose a good candidate, get behind them, and vote for them in 2020!"
11060,7po8ty,"I gather from your down vote that you actually mean the opposite of what you say, and/or don't consider yourself ""liberal"" or ""independent"".  

It seems as if you are the one who isn't comfortable with letting a healthy primary choose a strong candidate, and then voting for them even if they weren't your personal favorite during the primary.

Even in the unlikely event that Hillary Clinton ""would have"" beaten John McCain (we now know that's unlikely, even in the strong Democratic year of 2008, because McCain was a much, much stronger candidate than Trump), that's true for many candidates who didn't win their primary.  Just because her winning primary opponent won the general doesn't make it Her Turn for the rest of eternity.

Anyway, it's over.  She's gone.  Time to move on.  If you actually care about beating Trump, then do what you wouldn't do before, and prioritize that."
11061,7po8ty,"Why are you complaining about liberals and independents anyway?  (Probable answer - you're a Russian troll paid to desperately try to ""stir up division among Democrats"").  But let's pretend you're serious.  

The people Hillary Clinton targeted who didn't vote for her were ""moderate Republicans"" and white women.

Hell, she couldn't even persuade 26% of Latino women not to vote for Trump!

"
11062,7po8ty,"What a weirdly myopic view of the whole situation. I've literally not seen a single critic of her potential candidacy (including conservatives) mention her race, nor diminish her achievements. It's all been her lack of policy experience and the danger of the celebrity president problem continuing beyond our disastrous current moment. 

If, after one year of Trump, you assume this to be a racial issue and can't see why people MIGHT simply be slightly concerned about a world in which only billionaire celebrities with no political experience contend for the presidency, perhaps you're the one whose critical lens is off. "
11063,7po8ty,That speech seriously suggests that Oprah wants to hold public office!  Are you kidding?!
11064,7po8ty,"Well imo, we should be looking at having held a prior public office as a major qualification, and by those standards she's not qualified "
11065,7po8ty,"She has far less experience in the limelight than Oprah. That’s a big reason why Oprah isn’t a bad choice, politics is all about image. Kennedy, Reagan, Trump are examples. "
11066,7po8ty,"The list of qualified candidates running in the primaries be **unprecedentedly** long next election, guaranteed. Dems will have the most options to choose an absolute winner.

We are suffering under the most unqualified president of all time. Apathy is gone in caring people. The desire to fight this is (justifiably) high. People are waking up and realizing you don't have to be perfect to run and make a difference; you just need the courage and a few good ideas. 

At the end of the day, **we can, must, and will do better than Oprah.** or, so help us God, we will need 2 replacement political parties in this country."
11067,7po8ty,[deleted]
11068,7po8ty,"Judge her on her platform and positions when she runs, where shell have to answer for her past like every other candidate. Criticizing her on her fame and failures instead of seeing a black women who brought herself out of poverty and sexual abuse to become a successful and prominent, if not universally respected voice for people. If you dont like her policies or past or place in society, okay, but this kicked off after we heard a passionate empathetic speech providing a framework for where the metoo movement will sit in American history. We lack coberent, articulate humanist leaders. Thats the hysteria. Its also a liberal Trump revenge wet dream "
11069,7po8ty,">Reps saw Trump and thought ""Republican? Celebrity?? Let's do this!""

This is pretty revisionist. Trump was initially disliked by many Republicans and was [harshly criticized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpZGR_eTbAI) by members of the republican establishment throughout the primary but he gradually gained support because a large segment of the GOP base agreed with his issue positions like the wall, muslim ban, protectionism, etc. That plus the general anti-establishment ethos he was able to cultivate and his willingness to ""tell it like it is"" i.e. say racist or generally outlandish things that other candidates wouldn't, both of which I would classify as issues even though they weren't connected to specific policies.

Celebrity status definitely helped him get name recognition but the party didn't just blindly line up behind him. He won the nomination because a big chunk of the Republican base liked his positions better."
11070,7po8ty,"As a dem, I’m not voting for someone when I don’t know their platforms"
11071,7po8ty,"If they thought objectively they'd have voted for Bernie Sanders, since he would have won."
11072,7po8ty, I'd vote for him
11073,7po8ty,"Anybody who is pro-Oprah presidency at this point can only possibly be an idiot. 


Would Oprah run on a wacky far left Jill Stein style platform? Or a moderate neoliberal one like Hillary? Or a platform of pure rhetoric like Trump? 


How can you have any opinion of this when each of these is perfectly plausible and each would have distinctly different implications for her presidency? 


How the fuck don't you and everybody else who is pro celebrity presidency not get that having informed positions on public policy **actually helps politicians craft effective public policy?**"
11074,7po8ty,"There are three things that cannot be stopped:

1. People talking about crossfit.

2. People talking about being vegan.

3. People blowing shit up/making shit up just to bitch at it."
11075,7po8ty,"Who do you believe, two of her close friends, or the person herself?"
11076,7po8ty,"> After the speech, Oprah’s longtime partner Stedman Graham seemed to stoke the fire when he told the Los Angeles Times of her potential presidential ambition, “It’s up to the people. She would absolutely do it,” he said. But when Oprah was told backstage that “Oprah 2020” was trending on Twitter, the 63-year-old billionaire **denied she had any plans of running**. “I don’t — I don’t,” Oprah said, per Bloomberg. And maybe that’s for the best."
11077,7po8ty,So it’s decided. The Rock will be the next president. 
11078,7po8ty,"It would be the beginning of the Presidency becoming an entertainment side show, getting the majority of the public riled up while the real governing is done by other people, or not at all. "
11079,7po8ty,"Think about the type of person that becomes a ""real politician"". How many of those narcissists are actually capable of leading?"
11080,7po8ty,"Oprah is no doubt leagues better than Trump. However, thinking yourself qualified to be POTUS without any prior experience as an elected official shows a level of grandiosity, which is one trait of narcissists. I'm not saying I know what she thinks about her qualifications, but the fact that she is considering running suggests it."
11081,7po8ty,"No I don't think so, I would want some who is good with geopolitics and running a government. The more we mix business and government the more we get citizens united like legislation."

If the extremely old guy who lost in the last election is the only person we have to run, then shame on our party. We should have a plethora of new, fresh, young candidates to run who don't have the emotional baggage of the 2016 election hanging over them. "

See h_lance's posts above for what a real troll and/or myopic, hyper purist, True Scotsman Fallacy tainted, self destructive, troll looks like.    
  &nbsp;  
This country had 8 years of brilliance, dignity, and class with Barack Obama, and Hillary would have carried on that dignity with a progressive social agenda that would have seen nationwide broadband, even in the smallest of coal towns. Unfortunately, that message and those promises were drowned out entirely by a vapid, superficial, and borderline complicit MSM that only ever wanted to talk about a fake email scandal, showing the Trumpanzee's empty podium, and shrieking about every shocking thing he was saying.  
  &nbsp;  
However, even that wouldn't have been enough to flip the election to Trump. It took the addition of Russian microtargeting of Trump and Bernie supporters with fake news and propaganda that lead to voter depression and 3rd party support in key swing states. This is why you see Trump voters and the far fringe of Bernie supporters echoing the same Fox/InfoWars/Kremlin talking points, which you can see in full display above.  
  &nbsp;  
Now coming back around to my OP, which is nothing more than a copypasta, in 2020 we will be once again subject to the same kind of, if not more sophisticated, Russian disinformation campaign against not just Trump supporters, but those who would seek to create division and would rather burn the house down than see anyone but their idol of purity lose the nomination. A sensible person would have the perspective to unite behind the democratic nominee, as I did when I supported Bernie in the primary, but threw my support behind Hillary when it was apparent he had lost. A non-sensible person, well, just read the posts above and then reflect upon how important the minuscule differences between Bernie and Hillary were to you when held up against the daily assault on our constitution, morality, culture, and world standing.  
  &nbsp;  
There will be a candidate in 2020 you may not entirely agree with. You will probably be fed negative propaganda about them by Russian trolls who want to divide the democratic base and propel the draft dodging, Grifter-in-Chief to a 2nd term, but you have to put those differences in perspective, put country over party, over sectarian, hyper purist ideology, and vote for them. It could be Gillibrand, Klobuchar, Booker, Garcetti, Newsome, Biden, and yes, it could be Winfrey. What's most important is restoring morality and democracy to this nation, and rebuilding our standing in the world as well as the separation of powers."
11118,7po8ty,"I'll happily diminish her achievements. Some of us are old enough to remember that she got her start on a show that exploited poor and differently abled people for public spectacle and corporate gain, or in her own words to ""explore the bizarre nooks and crannies of human misfortune"". "
11119,7po8ty,"That's a very reductive explanation for what has happened. Oprah gives a very moving, eloquent speech, and everyone is excited about it. People like the speech, and admire Oprah. The speech really isn't particularly political, and there is no evidence it was meant to kickstart a political career. The next day we start seeing a ton of articles that are critical of Oprah, for reasons wholly unrelated to anything that has happened.

I get that these articles aren't critical of Oprah based on her race, but when the articles aren't actually related to what is happening I think the underlying motive is pretty clear.

Edit: We even have someone else responding who is [jumping at the bit to shit on the moment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/7po8ty/oprah_for_president_another_billionaire/dsitnzb/)"

11121,7po8ty,"With first past the post, a wide candidate set actually makes celebrity candidates much more likely. Trump got a ton of early steam from name recognition. 

When there's so many good candidates, the voters who care will split up their vote among the good, making it easy for anyone to get the highest overall. Especially the well known, no matter their reputation.

Honestly, without voter reform, I can easily see Oprah taking it by just being another blow hard."
11122,7po8ty,I wouldn’t exactly say I’m suffering under this president... I’ve seen two raises and a large bonus this year!
11123,7po8ty,What? I didn't do that to Hillary. Are you saying that because of what I said earlier in this thread? Because I think you'd be hard pressed to find me saying anything like it before. I believe Bernie was a better candidate and it was reasonable for him to run as a Democrat. That's it. Why are you coming at me like I've been bashing Hillary?
11124,7po8ty,People who voted Hillary arent complaining about Bernie being ropped. You good? 
11125,7po8ty,"Probably because Bernie does things with a rational explanation for the most part. Oprah has pushed ""Dr."" Phil and Oz on the world. That's bad enough let alone how much of a hypocrite she's shown herself to be."

11128,7po8ty,"I think if you overestimate the importance of certain aspects of experience/competence, you'll miss a lot of others.  

Just because one ""celebrity"" POTUS is a disaster doesn't mean it makes sense to lump them all together that way.  Again, she handpicked Obama who restored some credibility to the US after Bush, and the qualities of leadership - good judgment, admirable character, intelligence, commanding respect, etc. - maybe outweigh specific public policy experience - particularly if she is wise enough to surround herself with people who have that experience and listens to them.

In doing so, decrease excess of spending on the ""corporate welfare"" fields associated with military industrial and prison industrial complexes. 

Legalize marijuana and tax it as a luxury item like Colorado. At the very least, decriminalize it so the prison system isn't an overburdened mess rife with opportunity for private backers to gouge tax dollars.

He's mentioned or intimated these as methods repeatedly over the years. How exactly has Trump, any major Republican, or Hillary (aka Republican lite, if that's your preference) expanded on ways to decrease frivolous spending and reinvest in infrastructure for our various failing systems. We already pay more in healthcare costs per taxpayer than all of the socialized medicine countries while also paying for private insurance via employers or having to buy it outright.

There was a plan to get her elected from that moment on. No one else had a chance because the DNC wanted it that way. The Democratic Presidential nominee for 2020 was already selected eight years prior by the DNC. And we're talking about not opening of wounds. Fuck you wounds. The whole DNC is scum and I'm going to vote for who I think should be president. Not who they think should be president. That's why I voted Bernie.

In 2012 she came out saying that she was for same-sex marriage - after having said that her military tours helped open her eyes. She opposed the Defense of Marriage Act, actively working against it.  Why should we turn someone away if they've changed their mind? 

So far as her religious views, I'm not overly certain on her history there, apart from knowing she's Hindu."
11258,7po8ty,What did the DNC actually DO to force millions of Democrats to vote for her instead of him? Saying “the DNC was biased” or “they didn’t like him!” doesn’t tell me what actual actions were taken that effected the outcome. 
11259,7po8ty,"One reason for the DNC’s “bias” might be the fact that (as mentioned above, yet always conveniently ignored) Senator Sanders was not a Democrat and still is not a Democrat, while Hillary Clinton has been a hugely important member of the party for as long as many of us can remember. If Sanders wanted the DNC’s support, he should have swallowed his pride and became a member of the party. Would the GOP have been expected to support Donald Trump’s candidacy had he not formally joined the Republican Party? Hell no they wouldn’t. That would have been beyond crazy. Also, no potential candidates (apart from Vice President Biden, who opted not to run) on the Democratic side had any realistic chance of defeating Clinton, who in spite of a decades-long campaign by the right (and unfortunately, by some on the left) to defame her character, remains highly respected and admired among the Democratic base. She’s also a fantastic fundraiser and was the consensus pick of the Democratic establishment. When you take all of those factors into consideration, it’s not hard to see why nearly all (with the exception of Martin O’Malley, who suspended his campaign very early) other Democrats felt that they just wouldn’t be able to compete with her. They all had a choice to run, but they chose to sit out and support Hillary Clinton instead. You may think that the DNC “fixed” it for her, but it’s ultimately up to the voters, and while you chose Sanders, Democratic voters overwhelmingly chose Hillary Clinton to be their nominee, even without super-delegates. She was absolutely more than “decent” if unexciting, and undeniably more qualified than her opponent in the general election.

Also, the GOP had 17 candidates to choose from not because their cup runneth over with talent but because it was, in fact, so empty that a deranged internet troll/reality TV star was able to swoop in and take their nomination, an embarrassment of catastrophic proportions for the GOP until he tragically managed to actually win the election. Having that many choices just causes the process to be taken over by the loudest voices in the room, which as we have all witnessed over the past year or so, does not always produce desirable results. However, I do look forward to having a slightly deeper pool of Democratic talent to choose from in 2020, which is likely to happen as there is no obvious frontrunner yet in this election cycle."
11260,7po8ty,"Immigration, trade, social issues.

Sanders's strategy is to abandon social and racial issues and focus purely on economic populism. That's certainly better than any republican I support but doesn't align well with my priorities."
11261,7po8ty,That’s all we have right now. 
11262,7po8ty,"Oh boy. 

Name recognition, a year and a half ago. Things have changed. Bernie got more popular as time went on because people started learning who he was and what he’s about. 

Also, thanks for making my point. Hillary was favored in polls. She then won the popular vote, meaning the polls were within the margin of error. 

HRC and Trump have similar approval ratings now, which is sad. Bernie’s is way higher. 

And I’ll ask again: who do you think will beat Trump and what evidence do you have of that?"

As someone who is the son of immigrants and who works with people who are 80% immigrants or the child of immigrants, his general anti-immigration stance is disappointing. His general stance against programs that target racism is also disappointing. I don't think his universal programs fix that. The $15/hr policy in Seattle completely failed to help low income people, let alone help racially disadvantaged people. The lowest income people actually had their incomes reduced.

11456,acio6v,"Not to poo poo on her day, but what does being a person of color have to do with anything?

Elected officials or any job for that matter should be about finding the best person for the job, whether that’s a crusty old white guy or a 19 year old Nicaraguan dwarf. 

If we want to stop having people define others because of their race, we have to stop defining things because of ones race.

She won because the constituents thought she was the best person for their job, they didn’t vote for her because of her color. Let her merits stand on their own and don’t water it down by making it even 1% about her race.

Congratulations to her and let’s hope she serves the people well!"

11503,acio6v,"Do I?

When Patrick Mahomes is very obviously far more to the lighter side of 50% than the dark but considered black, is my understanding flawed?

When the same could be said for Steph Curry and so many others is my understanding flawed?

In what other facet of society do we consider something that's a majority of one thing to be called by its minority composition?


This country has a long history of not allowing those with *one drop* to be ingratiated, welcomed as equal. Shame on you and all who look to keep this narrow view alive. "
11504,acio6v,Thanks.  Wasn't sure if that included latino women.  First black woman.  Got it.
11505,acio6v,"Which is why I believe that we shouldn’t try to highlight the differences, but rather judge that person on their merits.

This individual obviously inspired the people based on actions, not color. 

Praise her for what she is as a person. Don’t define her by color."
11506,acio6v,"Like I said before, I don’t care what the race, ethnicity, religion etc. I care about someone who makes the city, county, district, state, and country better. If that’s a female, gay, Muslim circus performer then so be it, if it’s a middle aged white dude that comes from a wealthy background, so be it.

All I’m trying to say is we should be judging people on their actions and who they are as a person, not trying to separate ourselves into distinct groups.  That only drives a divisive mentality no matter how well intentioned the praise may be."
11507,acio6v,I'm all for diversity... But I draw a firm line at celery.
11508,acio6v,classy.
11509,acio6v,"Actually, Do you understand where the ""one drop"" of blood rule come from and why it was used?  "" Only in America could you be what I'm estimating to be around 1/4 black (white father and apparently mixed mother) but still be considered black. "" Only America? Hahaha, Have you forgot about South Africa and all other European colonies? I think you don't have a great understanding of race and racism in the world."
11510,acio6v,"People of 100 percent African descent aren't all the same color. They're not made out of cocoa. Someone whose ancestors are from Ethiopia or Somalia, for instance, are considerably lighter than people from, say, Nigeria or Kenya. Hence, a lighter-skin African-American today may have very little to no Caucasian ancestry because he or she has ancestry primarily from a part of Africa where people are lighter skinned. It all depends on where one's roots originate."
11511,acio6v,"Yes you do, dramatically so. 

There is no such thing as being ""majority"" black; you either are black or are not black. ""Blackness"" is not and has never been defined in terms of realistic biology or culture--it is an abiological term based on arbitrary classification--and thus can not be statistically divided based on anything real, like being ""part Irish"". Blackness means and has always meant ""other people's perception of you as not white"". 

Race in general is defined as other people's perception of you as belonging to a class vaguely defined by a collection of features most notably skin color. This general perception of someone as belonging to an arbitrary class indicates the kind of assumptions that people make when interacting with them. Acknowledging that people who have historically been perceived as belonging to the arbitrary class of black vs white--who have thus had dramatically different privileges and experiences--is not racism. Acknowledging that historically this woman would have belonged to the class of people which was systematically denied rights, respect, bodily autonomy, repesentation, and political participation is not bigotry. 

The one drop rule you refer to was a legal approach which co-opted language from biology to justify an expansive policy of bigotry and exclusion. It generally applied to people who individually were perceived as white but had ancestors who would have been classified by the general populace as black. Their ancestors status as being black was used to continue to deny rights, privileges, ownership, and respect to people who were black adjacent--a way to continue to exclude blacks and blackness from the privileges and access that whites enjoyed in society. Saying that this is just ""the one drop rule"" is to naively attest that the one drop rule ceased having relevance on society when it was abolished and to pretend that societies perception of someone as black due to having any amount of ""blackness"" in their family tree ended when the law changed. Thus, acknowledging that she has had experiences of inequality due to societies perception of her as a black person and understanding that she is one of a long history of people who have experienced the same and worse, and that despite all that, she has been able to be politically active and gain a position of moderate power is to paint a full picture of how hard she has had to work to get where she is.

This is a funny matter?"
11516,acio6v,Most Africa-Americans don't even have 100% Africa ancestry. Most  Africa Americas are only like 80% to 75% Africa and have dark skin. I find out I'm 75% Africa(from 3 different countries) and the rest is Irish and British. My cousin looks like ginger and she's still black.    
11517,acio6v,"I’m not exactly saying don’t see color and don’t see differences in culture etc. 

I’m saying this person had an accomplishment, don’t try to make it seem like that accomplishment was only due to the race. Race should not have had anything to do with it. Her accomplishments were her own, people can downvote all they want, that’s my feelings and thoughts on the issue."
11518,acio6v,"This kind of thinking is why people are turning against the liberal ideals. 

I’m literally saying the person should matter not their race or ethnicity but people are still butt hurt about it, let the downvotes come.

I’m a solid democrat but I really loathe the wanna be SJW that have to find an issue with everything. It’s like they want race to be an issue so they have something to be mad about."
11519,acio6v,"Actually, I'm not even sure what your point was. To me, you just sound ""half"" woke or something. wenchette, has made my point. Just do more research into ""colorism"" and 17th-century racist laws. "
11520,acio6v,I don’t think anyone was saying she was elected due to race. 
11521,acio6v,"Sorry that you not being able to dictate how POC are referenced and spoken about makes you want to change political parties. 

The issues “SJW’s” (which is hilarious that’s an insult) have usually surround deeply difficult issues like race, sexism, etc. 

Instead of tapping out, you should just take someone’s advice on how to address these issue, especially if they don’t affect you. "

We aren’t North Korea, give it a rest."
11527,7w6kzn,"does the crowd seem strange to you?  No one’s talking, they all have the same torch, they are all wearing non-name brand simple clothes, and they’re all white men.  It’s a little too uniform to be a march."
11528,7w6kzn,That's why Reddit meetups are so disappointing.
11529,7w6kzn,"And now every time I go and buy a tiki torch everybody looks at me odd bc they think oh there goes another white Nazi going to rally and chanting Jews will not replace us. No, sad. Some white people just like their backyards to look tropical. Damn racists. This is what people are talking about when they mention white genocide. 

Edit: sarcasm 

Edit: I feel like the first edit was necessary bc 2018 is a odd place where you just can’t tell how stupid, misinformed and uninformed some people are. Welcome to Trumps America it’s just like the scene from Billy Madison where everybody is a little dumber for having listened to words that Trump said/tweeted. "

One more than anyone else! A bigly general 

I mean the French have been doing it for over 100 years and invite other militaries to participate. That's apparently where he got this latest notion from "
11555,7w6kzn,Remember when we also thought that Trump running for President was a joke? 
11556,7w6kzn,"I thought it was a joke he ran for president.  I thought it was a joke he got nominated.  I thought it was a joke that he won.

I am still waiting for the punchline here."
11557,7w6kzn,what part of Trump do you think is a joke?
11558,7w6kzn,"Yes he wants it.  He saw France's military parade and thought that the American military should look as tough as the French military.  


Now I've got nothing against the French, they're good people and one of our closets allies.  They're really good at counter terrorism. 


But I'm not under some delusion about what the American military is.  Absolutely no one on this earth doesn't understand America has the largest, most well equipped military the world has ever seen.  (And there's a good argument to be made that that's a really bad thing) there's no fucking good reason to show it off.  Everyone knows.  Literally everyone already knows.  

But here trump is wanting us to look as well equipped  as France?  Are you fucking kidding me?  

How mentally weak and small do you need to be to think we need to look as tough as France?   


He's such a fucking moron.  And the military hates the idea.  Our soldiers hate parades, and I don't blame them.  They aren't for putting on display.   They aren't a fucking prop.  And they don't want a military display, because we're not a despot country.   Not yet, anyways

What a bunch of garbage.

Zero living Democrats ""founded the KKK"", instituted Jim Crow, segregated schools, or assassinated MLK.  

But I guarantee with 100 percent certainty that if you polled current Ku Klux Klan members on their current party affiliation, you'd see an OVERWHELMING majority of Republicans.  The Ku Klux Klan has ALWAYS been a Conservative, far-right organization...and the fact that the Democrats USED to be the conservative party is largely irrelevant to this fact.  

But you knew all of that, didn't you?  You knew that the KKK is full of conservatives.  That they endorsed Trump.  So you came here, and you spread this intentionally misleading propaganda, with the hopes of...what?  Fooling Democrats into quitting the party based on something that happened a century ago?  Changing their mind and supporting Trump, to spite the ""founders"" of the Klan - who, if they were alive today, would absolutely, unquestionably, have voted for him?  Or just to troll, because you know full well that this little ""tidbit"" about which party (and not which ideology) founded the Klan and fought for institutionalized racism is irrelevant to modern politics in every way?

That was not a debatable point, nor a question of nuance - it was a lie.  It was revisionist history, and you tried to defend Nazis.

A military parade of the scale we are talking about will require thousands of government personnel and equipment to be transported into dc, all of that equipment has fuel as well as maintenance costs.  You also have to pay all of the people in the parade even though they are away from their normal posts and not doing their normal work.  You also have to consider the costs associated with security, blocking off major roads in one of the most densely populated cities in the US, and probably a whole host of other expenses that I’m not thinking of.   We’re talking millions of dollars of tax money, to accomplish what?   A “show of strength”?  Our military is all over the earth.  There’s no question with regards to the strength of our military.  Trump is just looking for something to say “look how great we are!  I did this! Look how great I am!”.

This is completely nonsensical.  Half the world's ethnic groups were victims of ""genocide""?  An orchestrated campaign to exterminate them based on ethnicity...because Communism?  

>No please defend the money elite like a good boy you are, undermining the national state is something you like

I have, at no point, brought up the ""money elite"", or said anything good about billionaires or oligarchs.  You, meanwhile, defend Donald Trump, the EPITOME of ""the money elite"" who doesn't care about anyone but himself.  Are you serious? You realize people can...read things you've written, right?  And you can't ACTUALLY just tell lies here, and have them be believed?  This isn't The_Donald.  Facts matter.  
"
11729,7w6kzn,"If you want to look at it this way you should be fair and objective. If you consider that a “Nazi problem” then what about the Communist problem experiences by the other side? Remember those times Antifa rioted, shit down other protests, and attacked people and police under the Soviet flag? The Soviets were equally as shitty as the Nazis, hell even today some minorities still face discrimination in Russia. Look up how they treat homosexuality. And these people came out on multiple occasions in far greater numbers than the Neo-Nazis they allegedly opposed (who didn’t actually exist at a lot of events they went to. Imagine that). 

I’d rather not have Nazis or militant Communists marching in the street, thanks. And by your logic the fact that communism is a far-left ideology means that they’re the democrats’ problem. 

Both political parties are full of shit and share the blame in dividing this country and trying to pull it apart. To act like one is solely to blame because of a rally is ignorant. If you truly believe the Republican Party endorses Nazism I would recommend you take a step back and look at the democratic party’s links to groups like Antifa and abandon them. "

However when it comes to holding them accountable.  [CNN says they do](https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/politics/donald-trump-neo-nazi-rally/index.html)  but it doesn't fit your narrative.  So have your fun spreading more lies and crying wolf, hoping, endlessly, that maybe your slander will convince others that ""trump = nazi!!!!!!!!!!!!!! impeach meow!  based off nothing!  my whining should be enough to change your mind.

Should they pretend to be an army of boxers and kung-fu fighters so that you don't have to look at the source of your safety? What do you even mean? You are just in denial about America. You hate that it relies on massive brute force to exist and you need to hide this fact.

She wouldn't have disbanded the task force created by Obama to deal with shit like this. She wouldn't have thrown the Obama administration's guidelines to specifically deal with epidemics in the garbage like trump did. So no, I dont think it would be the same situation...."
11744,hvk2au,I said to my wife if Hillary were president we’d have 200k cases and 5000 deaths at this point and republicans would have crucified her.
11745,hvk2au,"Goddamn 

This is the best yet worst meme about that election.

People believed the lies of a legit criminal, or a fucking guy engaged in criminal activities over one of the smartest women to ever hold office in our federal government.

It's like the adage says, ""If you can't see how fucking stupid Trump is, you are fucking stupid."""
11746,hvk2au,Republicans spent decades smearing her. Most successful propaganda campaign of our lifetime
11747,hvk2au,So true. The longer Trump has been in office the worse it’s become and the worse the 2016 election looks.
11748,hvk2au,Trump is a charasmatic cult leader since if you can get people to willingly ignore and fight all sources of info outside of you alone you are a cult leader
11749,hvk2au,"Shoulda, woulda, coulda. Just vote this brickheaded orange trainwreck of a president out of the house come november."
11750,hvk2au,"I had a friend, centrist, tell me that Hilary just has so many shady things and ethics problems. I said name one and she couldn't. I got her to admit that it is just the perception of Hilary and not a true thing.  
Edit: first gold!"
11751,hvk2au,"Republicans pull out Hillary as if she’s the harambe meme that never got old. Get over it, she’s not only not in our lives but she was exonerated. She was the catchphrase for your presidential idiot. Beyond that, if everything we’ve heard about Hillary is actually true, it still doesn’t hold a candle to the incompetence of donald and the damage he’s caused our country"
11752,hvk2au,Hillary will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the worst missed opportunities we had as a nation
11753,hvk2au,"While I don't disagree at all I hope the DNC, and Americans specifically have learned just how incredibly effective disinformation and misinformation campaigns really are.  If you are reading this comment and you think that you have not been fooled before by something posted online, on radio or on tv then you are lying to yourself.

Elections have to be free and they have to be run with the knowledge that just because something is true or even credible does not make it a popular viewpoint.  

Trump won because he appealed to a voter base that felt increasingly left out of the realm of political discourse and increasingly disenfranchised every year. Whether that was the result of the natural entropy of politics or the overt acts of a party is irrelevant to the fact that it was TRUMP who capitalized on those feelings and not Hillary."
11754,hvk2au,Hopefully the damage he did to the Republicant Party is just as at least as bad as the damage he has caused to the country and the Grand Ol Perverts gets thrown in the trash bin of history.
11755,hvk2au,If Hillary were president we'd be neck deep in impeachment hearings over her shameful handling of the COVID-19 pandemic that has left 100 Americans dead.
11756,hvk2au,I think a lot of people ignorantly trash Hillary while not knowing a single thing about her.

You realize Trump killed 4 Marines right after he took office? He went ahead and engaged an attack in Nigeria that Obama thought was too risky, the mission failed and 4 Marines were killed. But, people want to cry Benghazi about Hillary yet Trump began his presidency killing Marines. And do you actually think she would allow Putin to put bounties on our soldiers heads? 

No, to say ""Trump and Hillary are equal shits"" is wrong and a false equivalence, period."
11803,hvk2au,"Do you think Hillary would’ve tried to end DACA? 

I agree that she wasn’t a good candidate. She would’ve made a perfectly serviceable President. It’s like saying cyanide is as bad as Vegemite because they both taste bad."
11804,hvk2au,I definitely dislike Hillary but it's hard to see her anywhere close to as bad as Trump has been.
11805,hvk2au,"Yes, but not all shit is equal.  Hillary would probably have been a relatively normal shit that just slides on out and makes a rather unremarkable mess to clean up when it's over.  Trump is the kind of shit that results from eating a dozen carolina reapers while you have diverticulitus and IBS and got conned into thinking that this was going to improve your life somehow.  And then you get colon cancer."

12098,if5trg,"Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.

""But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.

And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all.

Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.

On this new level you live, you have been living more comfortably every day, with new morals, new principles. You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago, a year ago, things that your father, even in Germany, could not have imagined.

""Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.

Sorry I need to clarify. No federal Republican Senators or Representatives that I am aware of today support M4A. There are plenty of Democratic Senators and Representatives that do. 48 percent of Republican voters support it but those numbers are dropping due to the Trump/Fox News propaganda campaigns against M4A. 88 percent of Democratic voters support it. If I have missed a Republican Senator or Representative who supports it I apologize, please list them. 

So once again: Democrats: Elected leaders who support M4A. Republicans: Elected leaders actively trying to convince Republican voters not to support it. 

I do not support the comparison you are making that the Republican Party and the Democratic Party have the same levels of support for M4A."

- a lot of them committed war crimes

- a lot of them were cronies for their big business pals

- even a ""great"" like FDR illegally rounded up and detained Japanese-Americans, a racist crime

- 99% of all Presidents are white men coming from a white supremacist patriarchy that only allowed white men to be considered for President"

Worse than that his staff are not well organized and do not have the respect of the press pool. This is why you hear them screaming, literally rudely screaming at the reporters to leave, pushing them out because they want it over ASAP. They know this is often when the president says something damning off the cuff. He’s done that repeatedly.

12225,9atjxa,Who said that?
12226,9atjxa,"Yes, there is a difference you're not seeing.

In the case of Molly Tibets' death, commentary from the right was intended to serve political purposes (to distract from Omarosa tapes, to forward an anti immigration agenda) - not to honor a life, mourn a tragedy, celebrate an accomplishment, etc.. In the case of McCain's death, there are relatively simple ways to do any of those things, and any of those things would not have to serve political purposes. Try one on:

""It's not news that McCain and I disagreed on many things. But I'll say this - he was a fighter, he never backed down, and I will always respect that.""

Two sentences, no political agenda, no ground given up. But, the reality is, Trump could never utter those two sentences, because these two sentences are a win-win, and he doesn't believe in win-win."
12227,9atjxa,"Yes. See, Mollie wasn’t a career politician, she didn’t know the president personally. 

Additionally, the left isn’t being tactless about her death or McCain’s.

While the right is being disrespectful about *both* their deaths and being vile towards Mollie’s family, who, as private citizens, should be allowed to grieve privately right now, and have people respect their opinion on their own child’s death, rather than having to deal with a bunch of lunatics publicly “correcting” them as though those strangers gained ownership of Mollie and her murder, and have more rights to an opinion on her death than her actual fucking loved ones do. 

The basis of your question boils down to you equating the left saying “please don’t shit on dead people, guys” with the right feeling entitled to actually shit on dead people and following that up by pretending the left are horrible, hypocritical oppressors for continuously saying: srsly. pls no, guys. 

If you think those two things are the same forms of “politicizing”? You’re a maniac.

12248,9atjxa,"I agree with some stuff, for example, when he was criticized for throwing paper towels. That was a bit of a reach and not a huge deal.

However this, this does seem quite petty and dripping with his typical ego centric malice."
12249,9atjxa,"I feel for you. As a democrat I struggle with the same thing. He's shown that he doesn't have a lot of tact (or purposefully projects a tactless personality), and I honestly don't need innumerable instances of that fact from here to eternity. 

But on the other hand, ""finding fault in literally everything he does or doesn't do"" IMO basically describes Republicans' attitudes towards Obama during his presendency (remember the idiocy of the american flag pins?). The only difference is this is on Twitter and not on Michael Savage's talkshow. 

I know ""but they started it"" is a juvenile argument (and I'm not even sure that's a defensible position given you could say the same thing about democrat's attitude to bush, etc...), but that's where we are. We live in a juvenile society. If you don't like that fact (and I don't), then note that the process of becoming less juvenile is the process of maturation. And maturing requires some self-reflection and consideration of the ways in which your own actions contribute to that thing that you don't like (in this case, drive-by, low-content smears at political figures).

take the beam out of your own eye, etc. 

To be clear I'm not accusing you personally since I don't know what you were doing during Obama's presidency, and what I wrote above applies equally to the OP. 

Also to the Democrats reading this I think it behooves all of us to think about what we're trying to accomplish by spreading bits of trivia like the OP. I don't think the tone of the OP is going to convince any conservative of anything beyond that expressed in the post I'm replying to (i.e., they're going to criticize him no matter what). And I get that this is a democratic space for democrats to post democrat things, and if the poster of the OP really believes that this action is a severe departure from past precedent in meaningful ways then I don't fault him/her for posting. But lets try to raise the level of discourse shall we? If its bad when the president tweets low-content garbage then its bad when we do it too.

If you have no problem with police abuses of power and actively benefit from the immoral power structure those abuses are protecting, but won't join up because you don't want to get shot... that doesn't make you better than the poor kid who saw law enforcement as their best chance out of poverty. 

Of course, in this analogy McCain is the kid who joined the force because his daddy was a detective, participated in the good ol' boy bullshit, but was injured in the line of duty (while harassing ""undesirables"") and is now venerated as a hero."

Mccain did his patriotic duty,  sent war prisoners home before himself in the face of torture, and went into politics to try and stop immoral wars like Vietnam from happening again.  Trump is garbage and has done nothing worth respecting.  Mccain is a good and respectable man even if his politics don't line up with mine or anyone else's. "

He might rightly be called a hero for his actions once captured, but that doesn't excuse his later actions. 

> [Mccain] went into politics to try and stop immoral wars like Vietnam from happening again. 

By advocating for American boots on the ground everywhere from Kosovo to Sudan? His suggestions for Libya sound like something the Pentagon would've written about Vietnam in 1962. That's to say nothing of his support for our interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

After all of his experiences in captivity, he wasn't even willing to take a moral stand on torture. Oh, publicly he railed against it, but when push came to shove he supported and voted for an ""anti-torture"" bill that not only exempted the CIA from its restrictions, but legally enshrined the old Nazi defense of ""I was just following orders"". When Sen Feinstein introduced a bill that would correct this CIA loophole, he voted against it. 

>I hate the g***s. I will have them as long as I live

Sen McCain wasn't afraid to use a racial slur on his campaign bus 28 years after he was released, because that's how much torture affected him... but apparently he only hates torture when he's the recipient.

There are innocent people who have been held and tortured by the US for longer than he as a captive of the NVA, because of laws that he voted for. Fuck John McCain, and fuck his legacy. I'm not going to go out of my way to celebrate his death, but fuck anyone who is trying to celebrate his life."

12320,9atjxa,"What Trump seems incapable of comprehending is that it wasn't McCain getting captured that made him commendable, it was the torture he endured especially after he declined being released earlier than his fellow POWs which was commendable.

Self-sacrifice is something our current POTUS is simply incapable of comprehending, and dedication to anything higher than oneself is simply impossible for him because in his own mind there could never be anything higher than DJT. Not even on a theoretical level. Thus he's incapable of anticipating the feelings and reactions of those who can and do appreciate and value self-sacrifice and dedication to things higher than themselves. All that can be said for Trump is that he's a good enough politician to recognize when he's screwed up, even if he can't fathom how or why he screwed up."

Your original comment said it’s best that he didn’t say anything at all; “What did people expect him to say, ""hey I hated this guy but he's dead now so I retroactively like him now?""

What if it is only his family? What if his family can’t show up because they’re all still in jail?

I have always said that I’m going to make an annual trek to his grave to shit all over it. Will I really though? It’ll probably be unmarked or guarded. What if someone could actually rob his grave and get a hold of his corpse? What would someone like me do to his corpse if I brought it out into the woods with only a WebCam and an Internet connection? Would I hook him up to some strings and pulleys and make him talk, then push to YouTube? What I would probably do is hook him up to some giant weather balloons, Then release him into the desert sky. I would do it in some bumblefuck southern state that supported him, so when he came crashing back down to earth he might have a high likelihood of falling through some supporters roof. That would be something.

I think the news of his demise will be the second most celebrated event in America over the last century. The first probably will be when his tubby, lying ass is thrown out of office. 

I know I sound like a lunatic but it’s fun to dream sometimes. Heck, I would be thrilled to have a thread sometime dedicated to simply talking about all the ways people could desecrate his corpse. 

Trump has truly made me realize just how deep the rabbit holes in my mind really go. It has been enlightening in a way, Because it’s taught me how to manage hating an individual like I do yet not being able to do anything about it. I really don’t hate anybody. If you talk to me in the daytime, I am patient, I try to be kind to everyone I meet, I am generally well spoken. But that motherfucker unlocks a side of me that is scary and twisted.

12389,91n6f6,Quick question... Why is it so expensive to play golf in America ? 
12390,91n6f6,[deleted]
12391,91n6f6,[removed]
12392,91n6f6,Is the US at war?
12393,91n6f6,Visiting troops in a war zone would also be a waste of money
12394,91n6f6,To be fair - he has not taken the $400K annual presidential salary either. 
12395,91n6f6,How would it cost us any money?
12396,91n6f6,r/veterans
12397,91n6f6,How about we hope for fewer war zones for him to visit instead of thus childish crap?
12398,91n6f6,[removed]
12399,91n6f6,"Seriously, You think he played too much golf, and didn't do enough to destroy the US and the Galaxy?"
12400,91n6f6,"We're in War Zones?? I don't remember Obama publicizing that we were at WAR with anyone. I certainly don't remember Congress sending us or making a declaration. 

Where are these War Zones and how did we get into them?? "
12401,91n6f6,The right message.  However that is an unneeded and disgusting image.
12402,91n6f6,[removed]
12403,91n6f6,I don’t get why both sides get so mad at this. If you don’t want the guy to be in office why are you complaining that the guy isn’t in the office? Let him golf and do nothing instead of him doing more stupid shit in that chair.
12404,91n6f6,He was just here in Kansas City today speaking at some VFW convention. I’m shocked he got invited.
12405,91n6f6,"The enlisted like him slightly more than the average American, but the (educated) officers like him even less.  44% and 30% approve, respectively.

12406,91n6f6,"No one I know, vet or active, has any respect towards Trump.


The people still supporting Trump have serious blinders on. Trump's first achievement in their eyes was hacking Hillary's emails. The fact Putin can shut down American infrastructure at will is great so long as it effects liberals."
12407,91n6f6,"I've never seen the Republicans do anything other than give the troops lip service. Remember when Rumsfeld quipped, ""you go to war with the army you have?"" He had been planning that shit for at least a decade and that's his excuse for not getting the troops body armor? Oh, but there was money to pay a private company, the vice president's company, to do what the military already is funded to do and does, that is of course logistics. 

All the Republicans, all of them not just the Manchurian Cheeto, ever do is give lip service to the things they supposedly value. What they really value is people who will vote against their self interests when they yell about God and country. "
12408,91n6f6,There was that unit from Fort Know that drove down I65 in their military vehicles while flying a literal Trump flag.
12409,91n6f6,Not starting another military conflict is a plus though.  
12410,91n6f6,No we dont.
12411,91n6f6,[deleted]
12412,91n6f6,I actually haven’t seen hardly any positive news stories about Trump. Could it be that the news is just an arm of the DNC and they wouldn’t post anything positive about Trump even if it was overwhelming positive for all Americans?
12413,91n6f6,"Obama let the airforce go to shit, don’t go telling me that “Trump is so bad” if you’re not going to look at Obama "
12414,91n6f6,Do you watch anything other than cnn lol
12415,91n6f6,"I’m more relieved that he has already spent 600 days in office. Almost halfway through our sentence. That is, of course, if he isn’t re-elected. In that case, I will leave the country and move to the bottom of a volcano."
12416,91n6f6,"Could be by one of his own troop, could be from an allied country.

Anything except Russia or North Korea really."
12417,91n6f6,Those bone spurs continue to be a huge deterrent.
12418,91n6f6,You must not know anything about the military to think this would happen.  
12419,91n6f6,"The fact that Obama is a black man disgusts most Americans more than what you said, basically. What a world we live in."
12420,91n6f6,We have our own issues friend
12421,91n6f6,"At this point Trump isnt really the issue. He's an idiot, bigot, liar, and more but none of that is new.

Problem is the republican Congress refuses to act against him. He's fulfilled a lot of the promises they have wanted, from tax cuts to strengthening boarders from illegal immigration, so they would rather stay complicit in his actions and just bear the brunt of the bad pr for the sake of maintaining power. Those who voice against trump get blasted by the party. Only republicans who are really voicing and pushing against him are those who are on the way out of the party. Anyone who feels they still have their career ahead of them will support him or refuse to stop him. The republicans are so desperate to maintain power, they even blocked a movement by democratic senators to strengthen defence for the elections against further Russian meddling [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/07/19/us/politics/ap-us-congress-election-security.html) 

The only way to stop him is for Americans to vote the republicans out of Congress in the midterm elections in fall, and bring a majority of democratic senators in (I say americas since I'm Canadian). If the democrats can secure a majority, they will be able to stop a lot of his antics or fully impeach him if the situation demands it. And democrats have thus far been significantly more vocal against Trumps bullshit, so we can but hope"
12422,91n6f6,"We just have to get a few hundred million people to get motivated to vote out the shit in Washington. We should have it done by next Tuesday. 

/s"
12423,91n6f6,Go play a round of golf on that day. 
12424,91n6f6,Stay strong 💪 
12425,91n6f6,"Take the House.

Make his life miserable."
12426,91n6f6,"I'd assume they count the days Trump ends up at one of his golf courses as playing golf. He might not necessarily be playing golf during those days. It is pretty much just about every weekend. I live in DC, and unless he's out in the world f'ing things for the world, every Friday like clockwork you see the helicopters flying out from the White House or the motorcade leaving town. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-has-trump-golfed-gone-to-mar-a-lago-2017-12"
12427,91n6f6,"Several sites try to track the Inflatable Boy's golf outings. The official count is hard to determine, because truth hurts. A source I like is this one:

https://trumpgolfcount.com
"
12428,91n6f6,There is also a website that kreps track like they did with Obama. I think it is trumpgolfcount.com or something like that.
12429,91n6f6,Sure blame the media instead of stupid people
12430,91n6f6,"Take your false equivalency horseshit elsewhere. 

Obama didn’t let any branch go to shit.

Stop your orange lying.

"
12431,91n6f6,"That’s a load of horseshit, since you same squealers were squealing about why hadn’t Obama visited troops in Iraq.


You guys are full of shit. 
"
12432,91n6f6,"It’s not that the golf itself is expensive, morso the fact that it’s the President playing golf. You have to remember they are putting up all the Secret Service members, a command post, all of his staff, whatever family is coming, fly in the armored motorcade and helicopters if needed, and general logistical support to keep it all running smoothly between them and the locals. And all of this at a resort that charges what most might consider exhorbitant fees for the time they stay there. Oh, and full price golf cart rentals, can’t forget those, too. "
12433,91n6f6,Security and accommodations.
12434,91n6f6,"You realize just like any POTUS, he needs a huge entourage of security every time he leaves the White House, right? It’s far, far more than a black van with a few agents in it, especially since Kennedy."
12435,91n6f6,"You aren’t that bright, are you?"
12436,91n6f6,"Dude it costs about 100,000 for an average soldier to make it through basic. So I think 600,000 is modest per game for government security. And I mean the shit head got trolled by a comedian because the won’t screen his calls.... I mean shit, he prb carries a few dudes in an unmarked suv with e-sapi plates and some m-4s..like a real dictator "
12437,91n6f6,Yes
12438,91n6f6,Why?
12439,91n6f6,Who cares?
12440,91n6f6,"His security detail is hugely expensive on its own, and he charges them + every government official to stay at his insanely expensive resorts. A big amount of the number seen here is pocketed by Trump in the end. "
12441,91n6f6,"None of us want any president visiting us in a war zone. We don’t need to hear whatever bullshit they need to spew for for the cameras. Just a waste of our time and assets, and your money."
12442,91n6f6,"He does.

"
12443,91n6f6,"What? There are a few war zones we are currently in.

Do you not wipe your ass unless Obama says so?

"
12444,91n6f6,"I didn’t create it. 

Harsh, but accurate. 
"
12445,91n6f6,"No, he’s a POS criminal fascist and we’re throwing him out"
12446,91n6f6,"Only one side got mad at this.

Trump used to complain about Obama and now golfs far more.

So pointing out the abject hypocrisy is important. 

It’s also another way to identify an orange cult member. 
"
12447,91n6f6,"It's the national VFW convention. I'm a member of the auxiliary. It's a mystery to many of us why he has so much overwhelming support from our membership. If you bring it up, you literally just get ""better than killary!"" And then they start spouting shit about emails. It's ridiculous. "
12448,91n6f6,"So 3 things:

1) The main reason Trump has decent numbers among military at all is because of appointing Mattis (that’s especially why Marines are so high on him). Mattis is a living folk hero to everyone but the SF community. 

2) The other reason is because of spending. I was in for Obama and the first few months of Trump. It went from QMPing E7’s for shit they did at 18, to $30k bonuses for signing up as a cameraman, literally the day he took office. Now that costs a TON of money and I have no idea what they paid for it with, because the budget was set before he took office. But that money doesn’t get down to officers, because they’ve gotten their free college already.

3) Part of me resents the whole calling officers educated bit. I know it’s just anecdotal, but I always hated that. I had an Economics degree and I enlisted and was an NCO. Loved being an NCO and wouldn’t trade it for being an officer at all. But officers over me had massively useless degrees, but they got to commission just because their degree in “fine arts studies” was a degree. But that’s just my own personal soap box. 

For 2020 purposes, the military will likely lean Trump again big time, regardless of visiting. Anyone who has had a VIP visit would rather not deal with that BS again. BUT, I’m not so sure that the military will bother voting en masse in 2020. I have long suspected 2020 will for for Republicans like 2016 did for Dems, Trump still has a decent sized support base but many of them don’t bother showing up to the polls - military or not. "
12449,91n6f6,"So, enlisted men aren’t educated? "
12450,91n6f6,"We should never have a president that would rather watch our power infrastructure be compromised for the sake of his relationship with Russia. 

If it's true that Putin or his hackers have access to our power grids, it could be life or death for a lot of Americans. ESPECIALLY Trump supporters living in impoverished and/or extremely hot locations like the South and some of the Midwest.

The damage they could do is immense, only beginning with shutting off people's air conditions and central air units."
12451,91n6f6,"Ive met vets who like him, but no one in my battalion liked him and openly made jokes about him.

I think conservative vets or hell even just conservatives who knew someone in the military think they can speak for all enlisted soldiers and thats just not true. 

You cant really run an actual poll on if people actually like trump in the military because of our oath but i bet if you did it wouldnt be stellar "
12452,91n6f6,"Perhaps.

It would be nice to know what wars the United States is still currently involved in and what Trump is actually doing to direct these military operations.

The last thing I ever heard is that he ordered a MOAB strike that did not accomplish it's primary objective, so that was sorely disappointing."
12453,91n6f6,"I don't know about ""overwhelming positive"" but I will give the man some credit.

I've heard the news about Kim Jong Un actually dismantling his nuclear test sites. That's huge. That might very well be some form of proof that Trump has done some objective good in the world, even if he kind of sucked up to the guy to get it done. It clearly worked."
12454,91n6f6,No.
12455,91n6f6,"You're*

Please tell me what Obama did to the airforce that made you think Trump fixed anything with it."
12456,91n6f6,[deleted]
12457,91n6f6,"Actually, yeah. I've seen excerpts from a few different news sources including Fox News.

I'm sorry to tell you that at this point Fox News has slowly gone from being about supporting Republicans to supporting only Republicans that support Trump. It's a fucking dumpster fire on that network.

If they had any real sense left they would have cut ties with him yesterday and start focusing on the other Republicans who actually need the help with the upcoming midterm elections.

But nah, I'm talking crazy."
12458,91n6f6,"If that happens, lmk if they have any space left, I'll move in too. "
12459,91n6f6,"Almost halfway through and he still hasn't started a war.

We might make it after all."
12460,91n6f6,There’s a really really good chance he gets re-elected. Never lose faith in the stupidity and ignorance of your fellow American!
12461,91n6f6,"Ah, smart thinking, a virgin sacrifice is just what we need in these times of need. "
12462,91n6f6,You said this in '16 and we didn't get that lucky. 
12463,91n6f6,"Sure, because no soldier has ever fragged an incompetent commander who is endangering the lives of his troops. "
12464,91n6f6,"Shortly after Obama was elected the first time, I visited a close friend in DC, who was (is?) a Republican. We were talking about the win, and she made the comment that she wondered how many people voted for Obama only because he was black. I told her it was probably the same amount of people that DIDN’T vote for him, because he was black. She agreed. 👍"
12465,91n6f6,It wasn't even most voting Americans. Just most of the ones that matter apparently 😟

Putin doesn't want Americans to have renewable energy and self sustainable infrastructure, so he's been using Republicans to block that effort so he can turn off American power.


If that's true..."
12489,91n6f6,"When I joined, I thought most of the military was hard right. My father grew up hard right and joined the army. Hated officers, loved to work. He shifted because of Bush.


While I served, I wondered if even half leaned right. The military is everything people on the left wanted, healthcare, education, a reliable paycheck, a job to go to, organization, two person integrity... The people swore by the Constitution and facts matter. I had one of those mini Constitutions on me most of the tone. The people who didn't want to read it or wouldn't take my gift to them, were usually yelling about somthing Fox was blaring about. That was weird.




After I left, I went hard left. I met a lot of awesome people in the service, everyone I'm in contact with hate Trump and fear his supporters. They keep in small groups and know what they can and can't do. "
12490,91n6f6,"That’s fair. In the end, anything to avoid nuclear war seems worth it."
12491,91n6f6,"Oh um ok, so it’s like uh, Trump is just terrible, nothing is good at all and .... vote Democrat? "
12492,91n6f6,"I’m not saying that trump fixed it, but Obama severely cut funding, enough so that barely any of the planes actually fly"
12493,91n6f6,No it isn’t but it sure isn’t Russian. Top cheese though lol calling everyone a Russian definitely helps your cause 
12494,91n6f6,The more the merrier!
12495,91n6f6,"His presidency is a testament to our country’s stupidity. I never thought we could elect such an unqualified jackass, especially since Obama proved that a country as racist as American can elect its first black president. Despite how you feel about the guy, it was one of the most progressive moments in recent times. I did not want it to come to this because I think people should vote based on substance, but what this country really needs is for the people to vote for anyone but Trump in the next election."

12519,91n6f6,"It makes sense that as a Democratic president he weakened the military and air force funding because he redirected it to other areas of the country.

I'm not sure how to comment on this personally, I have mixed feelings.

On the one hand I find it important that the United States keeps a strong military presence so that it can aid it's allies and defend itself if need be, but that America overspends on it's military to an impractical level where the money could be spent on infrastructure and so forth.

12530,91n6f6,"Because they want things to be the way they remember them 40 to 60+ years ago. 

They don't like brown people and they want white men in charge because they think that is how it should be. 

They have a fantasy nostalgia in their mind of their childhood and early adulthood where they didn't understand what really went on in the world. All they saw American leaders being strong and standing up to communism. They didn't know what was really going on they just had a perception of a strong America. 

You get into the 80s and through today and they understand better what is going on in the world but refuse to believe the same things were happening when they were younger because they think America wouldn't let it happen like the libruls do today. 

They are in a fantasy world where they truly believe white men are the best leaders for the country. God and Jesus are white to them so that is who they think should be in charge. Many truly believe that God made white men to rule other races because only white Christian men know what is best for everyone. 

 If a candidate has an R by their name and claims to be a Christian they will vote for them. What they do in office doesn't matter as long as they keep making their constituents believe that they are doing God's work. 

They base their opinions and vote based on their emotions. How something ""feels"" to them is all that matters. They feel that libruls are going to turn the country over to illegal immigrants and Muslims and in 10 years we will be living under Sharia law and eating Mexican food. They are full of fear and paranoia and that is what drives them. 

You cannot assign logic to their decisions because there is none. The GOP base votes on emotions and whatever propaganda against anyone without white skin is put in front of them. 

I'm 41, white, and I've lived in the south my entire life. So I have some experience with what I'm talking about. This is conservative/rural America and what they believe. "
12531,91n6f6,And now his ridiculous “trade war” is costing American companies money. 
12532,91n6f6,This exactly. Americans all around join the service. It's absolutely amazing.
12533,91n6f6,"Made treaty with North Korea, receiving bodies of American soldier back. Unemployment numbers down, GDP 4.1%, got NATO to contribute more towards security, significantly diminished ISIS, tax reforms, great SCOTUS picks, killed TPP. That’s just a few big ones that aren’t debatable. I think there is more to come. 
"
12534,91n6f6,"An article that says the Air Force went to shit? Never happened.

Air Force budget never decreased. Entire Defense budget never decreased.

12535,91n6f6,That's something you'll have to research for yourself.
12536,91n6f6,"Oof I stand corrected! Didn’t realize it could be that expensive for it all! 1mil a pop still to me sounds a little iffy, but hey, like that article said- 72million is like making 50,000 and spending 20¢"
12537,91n6f6,"No, genius, we are at war with the opposition army, The Taliban."
12538,91n6f6,"Have you ever been a soldier in a war zone?

They value the President visiting them. 
"
12539,91n6f6,"The point of the tax returns is not that we don't believe he pays taxes. It is that it will show where he makes his money, and thus, if he profits directly from his decisions as president (for example, when he makes his employees stay at his own hotels). "
12540,91n6f6,This is not sinking to his level. 
12541,91n6f6,You put a lot of effort into this comment

Orange smegma cultist is trying to recruit people into his cult.



Luckily we are going to lance that festering pus-filled cyst come November.
"
12543,91n6f6,"Things were the way they were decades ago because of two _progressive_ presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt and their social programs, labor protections (unions!), antitrust laws, higher taxes on the wealthy, and a livable minimum wage. Plus the GI Bill and low cost college that created a skilled work force and a vibrant middle class. In other words, everything Donnie and his slack jawed minions HATE. "
12544,91n6f6,I never said they were the smartest people.
12545,91n6f6,"I can very much debate whether or not these were of his doing or a good thing. But that is not the purpose of my question. 

So now that you have named some things you consider good, can you say  the media has not reported them as you claim in your original comment?

12547,91n6f6,"I said who are we at war with your the one who said Afghanistan. Also we are not at war with them we are just supporting Afghanistan’s effort to fight them.  We do not engage in combat there only training, advising and information gathering.   Does that really qualify the US for being at war? And do you really want trump to go there?"
12548,91n6f6,"I have not, have you? Also, yes sure someone going ""oh the president, cool"" is definitely worth however much it would cost. "
12549,91n6f6,Who are you to speak for troops in a war zone? 
12550,91n6f6,"So you can neither confirm or deny it. So you don't know? You just assume. By the way of you haven't noticed the ""Trump"" brand has gotten tarnished by running for president. He has lost a lot of money doing what he did. He could have just not ran and kept his brand name. "
12551,91n6f6,"Showing a politician golfing on our Flag, on the coffin of a fallen soldier is beyond the pale.  Yes, Trump is horrible, but not this horrible."
12552,91n6f6,About as much effort as Obama gave during his presidency.
12553,91n6f6,"You can dig for these facts on conservative sites, better sources are watching for White House newsletter claims and looking up the stats or facts on government websites, open souse type stuff.

12560,91n6f6,"So if you ignore all other media and get your information from conservative sites, the truth wall suddenly appear?"
12561,91n6f6,This is true but we still are not at war and do you really want trump to go there?
12562,91n6f6,Again? You never asked me that 
12563,91n6f6,Hahahaha thanks for playing! 😋
12564,91n6f6,"No, I try to avoid conservative sites too. I look at statements made and try to confirm through open source data or government websites. Basically do the job of the journalists minus the editors opinion. Sometimes you have to use the media and in that case you try to balance it out. This isn’t a football game with team loyalties, it’s about finding the truth. My point being is that you can’t find positive details on left leaning news sites, you always have to go to conservative sites to find it. If you want negative news about Trump, I definitely know where to go. Why can’t the media just cover Trump fairly? "
12565,91n6f6,"We are at war.

And my statement was “Are you okay?”

And your response was “This is true”.

WTF."
12566,91n6f6,"It means who are you to speak for the tens of thousands of American abroad?

12661,hnsjlk,"There was a time when rednecks were some of the more liberal among us. It isn’t the origin of the term, but it was picked up by miner unions who did some good damned work in the mid 1900s to protect their rights to organize.

A lot of that has been lost over a couple generations, but not all of it. I’m from West Virginia, there’s liberal rednecks, and we shouldn’t forget that Democrats only truly function as a big tent party, and you’re going to have to let some in the tent that might not be on board on all issues."

12663,hnsjlk,"“Redneck” started as a classist slur. Working-class people, urban or rural, can hold liberal, conservative, or even radical beliefs. There’s a far-left Anarchist organization called Redneck Revolt and they have a gun club called the John Brown Gun Club.

12665,hnsjlk,I live in one heck of a rural area here in eastern nc. It is funny most the folks here are for Biden. A few forever trumpets are around. Most folks are pissed at Republicans for ducking with the budget in the GA. We would like to pay to have our water plant fixed so we can have safe drinking water. So that hate has spread to the national Republican party and an increase in some Democrat love. There are still those that think covid is a hoax. So you can't win them all.

12716,hnsjlk,That is definitely true. They do thrive off low voter turnout and they are always trying to make it hard for people to vote. Like making Ex-cons pay money to get to vote again. It’s ridiculous.
12717,hnsjlk,"Yea. Our water was poisoned by a garment factory. As we have fire retardant in the water supply. So we have to pay extra for water from the county, cause our plant can not filter out the toxins. So this causes the water bill to be one of the most expensive bills that most folks have. It is a crying shame that the state will not give the small water company the money to fix it. Apparently we do not matter, because we are not a large city."

There is no reason to believe that a society whose means of production are collectively shared must be, or will likely result in totalitarianism. In fact, the exact opposite would be expected. Oppression has fertile ground to manifest in *non*-egalitarian systems such as capitalism, where the means of production are owned by private entities and used to profit off the labor of workers.

>imagine if this were something more relateable to reddit

You probably don't get it because your nearest point of reference is a Comic Con where the point is to cram as many hygiene optional fans as can fit into a convention center and extract as much cash from them as possible. 

The Constitution of the United States was not a document written to restrain the powers of Comic Con and attendees have no 1st Amendment rights at Comic Con and Comic Con is in no way accountable to attendees of Comic Con. 

Elected officials don't get to decide who asks them questions, what those questions are, and they don't get to send interns to rip microphones away from them when you don't like it. The 1st Amendment was written specifically for this scenario, to restrict governmental power from becoming unaccountable to the people by restricting press unfavorable to them, and this Acosta issue is an escalation of Trumps continued practice to do just that. 

Your claim that a comic con is more relatable to Reddit but that's really just commenting on your own subscriptions and how little you know anything about what you're talking about.

I think it would be worth it for us to learn some better judgement and restraint when it comes to the characters of Republican candidates."
12952,hpc95g,Wise up. One must give Mitt Romney the highest credit for being such an stand up man. He had the Guts to face the Republican pro-Trump Pack on his own.

Even when they started saying Russia interfered in 2016, initially I blew it off as an excuse for a loss we couldn’t explain.  I’ll be damned if Russia and Trump aren’t like peanut butter and jelly.  And Romney was right.

But he didn’t change.  The party changed. They don’t hold to a single value they used to espouse.  The Democrats do."

His idea of economic fairness is woh ever wins keeps the pile and fuck you.

That said he did have a heavy hand in some sketchy child therapy torture.

He doesn’t have much empathy towards animals.

Other than that he’s a pretty mainstream Republican. Cruel, heartless and spoiled. 

All that and still not even close to being the worst. By a long shot. 2016 really should illustrate just how bad some of those wingnuts really are."
12970,hpc95g,This is accurate. The Republican Party of 2020 is raw unapologetic corruption and betrayal of American values and democracy.

12980,hpc95g,"The last 3 sentences are accurate, but I never felt he was the worst by any stretch. If Romney had won in 2012, I would not have had any serious worries about the future of our nation.

12990,hpc95g,"Yeah he was bad, but he wasn't the worst Republican. What he was was the worst threat to non-conservatives from the Republicans at the time because, as their Presidential nominee, he gave the possibility of full Republican control of government again just four years after Bush and with the Tea Party still pretty much at the height of its power

In 2012, Democrats somehow made gains in the Senate despite fighting on the same terrible map they had to defend in 2018, but if the national environment was 5.5 points or so more Republican (what Romney would have needed to win the electoral college given Obama's advantage there), there's at least a decent chance Republicans would have taken the Senate as well

In 2020, Mitt's the same, but now instead of a threat to Democrats, he's just one of 100 Senators and a thorn in his own party's side"
12991,hpc95g,He seems now like he is more akin to 2008 Mitt who was different than 2012 Mitt

12997,hpc95g,"As a MA resident until last year, I think there’s some truth to that, but I also think much of the “moderate Republican” prestige that MA governors get is the result of the overwhelming Democratic majorities in both houses that force them to either agree with moderate reforms or spend their entire governorship getting the shit kicked out of them by the legislature.

13012,hpc95g,"> Also, Romney was dead on about Russia being our biggest threat and Obama laughed at him.

Romney wasn't prescient on that. He was an opportunist who had been calling Islamic terrorism, Iran, and China our biggest threats in one order or the other but saw an opportunity to win points when Obama was caught on a hot mic in March 2012 saying that he'd have more flexibility to negotiate with the Russians after the 2012 election (which came in the context of, for instance, the at the time recent START treaty that was ratified after the 2010 midterms). He changed course to ""Russia is our number one threat"" immediately after that (side note: this was a running theme with Romney's 2012 campaign where he'd repeatedly attempt to reframe his campaign in reaction to recent actions by Obama)

And the way in which Russia has been most damaging to us since then (interference in our elections and society with at least the leadership of his party's tacit approval) clearly wasn't what he was referring to. The things he mentioned were things like Russia's obstruction at the UN and Russia supporting other US enemies like Assad

Also China is still a much bigger threat regardless of Russia's recent actions"
13013,hpc95g,I doubt Obama thinks about that at all tbh. Idk how people couldn't see it. Russia has always been on my radar and I'm just a commoner.

There's no set number of jobs in the country, it's fluid. Losing a job doesn't mean they're forever doomed. Sometimes it's for the best for everyone and not a job people liked. 

Criticizing that aspect of Romney's field wasn't the most fair attack on him by the Obama campaign. Corey Booker got into trouble for calling out Obama's campaign on it.

I find the question of abortion to be a very complicated one, I don't believe something that is potientially a living human should ever be slain without reason, but... there's a lot of situations... welll.... It's a moral grey area that honestly hurts to think about for too long

As for Capitalism, I utterly despise it

Still you have your ideas, and I have mine, the fact we can discuss our differences without the Government saying one of us needs to be in jail for having a dissenting opinion with what they believe.. is a beautiful thing. I'd never want it taken...

Sadly these ""Meme Conservatives"" only seem to enjoy ""Free Speech"" when it's used by them to insult us, but the reverse is a blasphemy of the highest order, and if we tell them we disagree that's also ""Truly Unorthodox!""..... and they call US Snowflakes...

Thiose ""Meme Republicans"" truly deserve a leader like Trump, but the rest of us, Left or Right, sure as hell don't.

Sadly I find too many people who swing to the right, no matter how much they hate the ""Meme Republicans"" and the blatant racism... dare not speak out against it or even acknowledge it for too long... fearing that it's impossible to disagree with the GOP, lest the Democrats immediately ban all religions except of Atheism and Islam, force us all into gay marriage, and abort a fetus for fun.

Exactly

>i did see a chart, there was a drastic change

I don't believe you, unless you didn't zoom out at all.

> isis was not lagrely defeated, in fact they still exist

Then that contradicts that Trump defeated them. But yes they largely had fallen already

>obama supported gun control

Most Americans support some restrictions on guns. And Trump said he wants to take guns from people with no due process anyway. 

>and didnt undo the patriot or freedom act

But did Trump? You asked how Obama was better, not if they were the same

> trump knows there is 2 genders and transvestites are a medical condition

Gender is made up. I don't care how other people decide to categorize it. Nobody says gender dysmporphia isn't a medical condition (at least most people dont). The point is to treat them like human beings. The fact that you call them ""transvestites"" tells me you haven't looked into this issue much.

Obama his Congress reduced the deficit after the recovery from the 2008 recession. Trump and his Congress are increasing the deficit during a period of economic expansion.

And now Trump is covering for a regime that dismembered a journalist. A regime he happens to have many business ties with."

13313,j3xtid,It’s early. He is still in the incubation period. Let’s not sigh in relief just yet!
13314,j3xtid,Next time wear a mask at the debate if it’s not virtual. We need you completely healthy.
13315,j3xtid,Good news.  Funny how wearing a mask and taking basic precautions actually works.
13316,j3xtid,Democrats will wait before saying anything about the 2nd debate which will obviously be cancelled. They will wait again as long as they can before making a decision on the 3rd debate.
13317,j3xtid,I still only half believe trump has covid that man just lies  too much too be trusted
13318,j3xtid,VERY presidential response. Will make an amazing president.
13319,j3xtid,Unfortunately you can still test positive after an initial negative if you’ve been exposed so hold your breaths for another week or so.
13320,j3xtid,What a sensible message.
13321,j3xtid,Thank goodness!!! Stay inside and stay safe.
13322,j3xtid,"Lol, Biden throwing shade."
13323,j3xtid,I'll believe it when you pass 2 out of 3 tests. Too many false negatives.
13324,j3xtid,"Not really, he always wears a mask."
13325,j3xtid,Any doctors want to note if he should be tested again in a Few days?
13326,j3xtid,Is this what it’s like when someone doesn’t fuck up an easy win
13327,j3xtid,"forgot what a leader and responsible person looks like, hope he wins"
13328,j3xtid,It’s karma that trump is in the hospital with Covid. But thank god Biden is okay
13329,j3xtid,Thank god!
13330,j3xtid,It's still a close one for the next 14 days. He needs to be tested every day for the next 14 days but especially the next 3-5 days. He's not out of the woods yet.
13331,j3xtid,Thank God.
13332,j3xtid,"He's at a age he would have a great problem if he had Covid. Keep safe out there Joe, brainless Republicans without mask pose a great risk for health"
13333,j3xtid,"I hope he tests daily , continues to be cautious and gets a hold of that secret antibody cocktail Trump has access to"
13334,j3xtid,Joe is a way better person then me. There is no way in hell that I would pray for him. Trump has cost thousands of lives and even when people recover they can still have long lasting conditions.
13335,j3xtid,"Kinda sad that everybody keeps forgetting that these masks reduce the spread by containing large droplets, but do absolute jack all for filtering airborne droplets. Everybody saying Trump got covid from not wearing a mask just sound like idiots. Reality is he likely spread it far and wide to others by not wearing a mask."
13336,j3xtid,"There is ZERO chance either of them would test positive 2.5 days after exposure. They need to quarantine for 14 days like everyone else should. I'm shocked and upset that he is continuing with activity without quarantine. How do they not get that daily testing still does not prevent outbreaks, as the debate proved. He would not even be 100% certain to test positive within those 14 days even if he was actually infected. People don't understand the severe limitations of testing, especially within the first several days after exposure. Even when people are dying from it, half the time they test negative. I'm a former infectious disease epidemiologist."
13337,j3xtid,"Don't worry guys, Joe's got the biggest mask the presidents ever seen."
13338,j3xtid,"Hey Mr President Biden (I know, I know) keep looking like the fool that the dear leader said you looked like because you're wearing those big masks, I want you to be a fool and and I want you to keep wearing those masks because I'm also a fool because I wear a mask, and to all the fools out there that wear masks you keep looking like the fools that you are and get out and vote for Joe Biden on November 3rd and by the way wear those big foolish masks and if you're worried about getting out to vote please get a ballot and vote blue all down ballot and send it in asap. We can get the presidency but if something happens we can still get the Senate back and we have the house then we can do what those cowards that were called Republicans at one time were too scared to do and that is impeach and remove a wannabe dictator from office. And this to my liberal friends out there please remember with a Joe Biden administration you will get some of the things you want and rightfully so, but with the demented dear leader in office for four more years you and I and all others that don't give a shit about him will continue to get a big 🖕u.
All of you out there be safe. 😷☑️🌊"
13339,j3xtid,But two week incubation which means he has to retest in 14 days after the debate
13340,j3xtid,Thank goodness 😊
13341,j3xtid,You’re not clear yet. It can take 3 to 14 days.
13342,j3xtid,"Does this mean Trump’s gonna Zoom his way into the next presidential debate from his hospital bed?  If so, can we just put him on mute for Biden’s 2 minutes/question?"
13343,j3xtid,Just one more way Biden won the debate.
13344,j3xtid,Not out of the woods. Give it a week.
13345,j3xtid,Trump and his staff  didn't have the decency to apprise Biden of his positive Covid-19 test result.  But that should surprise none of us here.   I'm glad to see a photo (Twitter) of Biden wearing an n95 mask -- he needs ALL the protection he can get.

13351,j3xtid,"I don’t see there being any chance another debate happens.

The last scheduled debate is only 20 days away.  There is no way you risk putting Biden in a room with Trump and his staff mask or not."
13352,j3xtid,"If another debate happens, it needs to be virtual or held outdoors. It was stupid to do an indoor debate in the first place, but now it's inexcusable."

I’m actually impressed someone can be capable of so much evil and stupidity. That man is a freak of nature."
13357,j3xtid,"He usually doesn't lie in ways that make him look weak, though.  His lies serve his ego.  So I don't think that he's lying about this diagnosis."
13358,j3xtid,"It's too much political suicide to take yourself completely off the campaign trail for two weeks. Believe it or not there's still a swing vote he can earn of people who are undecided. 
 No way he's lying."
13359,j3xtid,No malignant narcissist would admit they have a disease. They are simply not capable of admitting any weakness
13360,j3xtid,Plus if he was exposed on Tuesday it probably wouldn’t show up yet.
13361,j3xtid,I’m almost 100% certain he’s probably tested every day.
13362,j3xtid,"Yep a great tremendous problem, believe me. People say it I've heard"
13363,j3xtid,This is a warning for trolling. There will not be another.
13364,j3xtid,You're a better human being than most. I don't want him to DIE. But he deserves a comeuppance for the wilful ignorance and denial of the facts around the virus. People are DEAD because of him.

13366,j3xtid,"As someone who doesn’t particularly support either candidate, it’s maturity like this that I think we’re really missing in today’s political climate. Attack the policy not the person. (I’m looking at you trump)"
13367,j3xtid,"For me, the 200K people that died under his watch outweigh my sympathy for him."
13368,j3xtid,"I'm not saying it's true, I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if I found out he doesn't have it and is trying to avoiding the debate due to the format change preventing him from talking over Biden which is the only strategy he has. He absolutely loses otherwise."
13369,j3xtid,"They could put them in separate glass rooms, like the Pope mobile style"
13370,j3xtid,You’re right!
13371,j3xtid,"If Trump is at Walter Reed due to symptoms, and not as a precaution, there will be no more debates."
13372,j3xtid,"I think they have to cancel it, or make it so that there is NO audience, it is outdoors or very well ventilated, everyone has masks (because masks are more effective at preventing you from spreading it than preventing you from contracting it), and put a damn mute button for “both of the candidates” even though we know who will be the one that needs it. Oh and trump has to actually get tested for covid"
13373,j3xtid,I agree. I don't think there will be another debate. And it would not surprise me at all if Trump withdrew from the race. He cannot live with losing. And it certainly looks like he will.
13374,j3xtid,"This won’t make him look weak if he bounces back in a few days. The base would think he was indeed the Chosen One, at least the ones that already do."
13375,j3xtid,"Except Trumpty Dumpty’s recovery will be MIRACULOUS!  The Best Recovery Ever!  No one’s ever had a recovery like Trump’s recovery from COVID-19 will be.  He’s got the strongest genes, y’know.  He’s the healthiest President with the strongest immune system EVER!

And, that virus was weak, so weak, it never stood a chance.  It was a Loser Virus!  One day it just disappeared....

13377,j3xtid,"I don’t want him to die, but a couple weeks on a ventilator might get his supporters to wear masks, which would save thousands of lives.

Also don’t want him to die because I want him to see consequences for his actions.

Also don’t want him to die because a lot of aggravated republicans voting for Biden to avoid Trump’s insanity might find President Pence way more tolerable.

But bounce back, I can’t say I welcome.  Not just because my first thought was “karma”, but I think a rapid recovery from “sniffles” would get even more people complacent and kill more of us.  So I’m hoping he gets the Boris Johnson experience rather than the Bolsonaro one."
13378,j3xtid,"It would be so disappointing if he died. He has to live through the sheer humiliation of an electoral defeat, and be charged for his crimes. He won't get to take the easy way out."
13379,j3xtid,I don't want him to die before the election because I think the country needs to vote against him and the GOP to stand a chance of correcting course.
13380,j3xtid,"I don’t want him to die either, bc Mike Pence would turn this shit into Handmaid’s Tale."
13381,j3xtid,"Yeah I definitely have been considering whether this could be a hoax.

To me he just loses so much credibility with the downplaying he’s done on mask wearing and the virus in general.  Plus the damage from not being able to campaign.  It seems like a dumb strategy which of course doesn’t necessarily mean it isn’t his strategy"
13382,j3xtid,Nah this makes him look weak. He made a video before going to the hospital and his energy was way different than normal.
13383,j3xtid,"I thought this at first, but if you really think of it it doesn’t make sense that he would do that. First of all, he’s trying everything he can to get the spotlight off COVID, so there is no way he would fake COVID when he’s trying so hard to push it under the radar- him having it just brings it up again. Second, he just made fun of Biden a couple nights ago for wearing a mask. He would have known he was going to fake COVID that night and wouldn’t have made such blunt statements like that. Also, even if he does recover in 2 weeks, he still has to be quarantined for an additional 2 weeks (at least a friend of mine who had it did) which will take away CRUCIAL campaigning time, debates, and important rallies. If it were a few months ago it might have been fake, but I don’t think it would be anything but detrimental to fake COVID right now."
13384,j3xtid,"Honestly I doubt it considering this does not actually look good for him and will likely hurt him worse then the debates could with some people since he was basically claiming that wearing a mask was stupid and that the virus would just magically go away. It also puts into question his health and makes him look negligent in going to a rally when it was already suspected that he had been exposed to it. I just can't see this being better then the debates for him, especially since they could just change the format of the debate to keep him quarantined."
13385,j3xtid,Covid-19 may be Trump’s “bone spurs” of 2020
13386,j3xtid,Yeah I’m pretty sure he doesn’t actually have it
13387,j3xtid,😂😂😂
13388,j3xtid,Combine that with a mute button for Trumpty Dumpty’s mic and you’ve got the only way it should happen!
13389,j3xtid,"We know he’s got symptoms..just not the severity of those symptoms.

14 days would be the “quick” turn around for a “normal person” to get better. This is the 74 year old President of the United States so I don’t see how they don’t take further precautions even if he somehow kicks this thing quickly. I don’t see him getting on a debate stage this month."
13390,j3xtid,"No chance..withdrawing from the race is “losing”.

He’s simply going to deny he lost and try to get the courts to overrule our democratic process."
13391,j3xtid,"A few days despite already having mild symptoms would make me very suspicious for lying, since even the young and healthy people that get it tend to be knocked out for 10-14 days.

But I’m not inclined to think it’s a hoax because it brings on the karmic retribution too hard.  It’s hard to see it and not think “what did you think was going to happen, dummy”, plus criticism for knowing Hope Hicks had it and then exposing Biden, his family exposing Biden’s family, and all his supporters in NJ plus Mitch McConnell and quite a few others.

It’s also putting the highlight on two features he hates: he’s old and he’s fat.  The fact that this is now newsworthy because of his risk factors rather than just being mean can’t be what he wants.

Oh and the stocks took a dive."
13392,j3xtid,Thats what i thought
13393,j3xtid,"As much as his supporters will jizz fountains, it won't do much to sway undecided voters that are aware that he's a moron"
13394,j3xtid,"No they can't say that. If you see then do it, report them."
13395,j3xtid,"Maybe a week on oxygen? No real lasting effects, but still makes him feel like a weak person. Even though needing oxygen is not actually weak when your body is fighting a contagion."

13400,j3xtid,"I'm sure there are already FOIA requests to get the details of his positive test. If he's faking it, they'll refuse to release the information under the guise of national security or some such nonsense"
13401,j3xtid,"idk, i feel like his campaign could have made him tweet it so he wouldnt turn off undecided voters in upcoming debates. i dont think he'll lose any credibility with his supporters since all his ads talk about how beautifully he handled covid spread, and they'll prolly just view him getting infected as unfortunate and not something easily preventable. his campaign moghtve weighed the pros and cons of saying he's infected or sumn

all speculation tho"
13402,j3xtid,"I am definitely thinking Trump may not be sick at all for exactly these reasons:

1) skip debates     
2) after a “miraculous” recovery, he gets to say “see? Not that bad! This proves my response was appropriate and proportional!”     
3) enjoy post-sickness bump in the polls"
13403,j3xtid,"I don't think he will either, butt that wouldn't be losing."
13404,j3xtid,"It does bring up his age and fat rolls, which he would prefer remain unnoticed I don’t think he cares if he exposed others, I may be too cynical here.

He’ll look at the stock market volatility as a sign of how important and influential he is. The thought of others watching their savings or retirement going ip in smoke wouldn’t phase him.

Overall he’s likely pleased with the attention and even more pleased that we’ve stopped talking about his stupid performance at the debate. It would take something pretty big to derail that topic, but he found it."
13405,j3xtid,"I’m going vent.  I’m going for survived after vent, but more than a tube in his nose.

Both as karmic justice but more as “this guy’s downplaying has killed thousands of people and his supporters still refuse to put on a mask”.

Maybe seeing your bold brave leader face down with a machine might get his followers to stop coughing on people that ask them to not attempt to murder them.

I also have some anger issues about how he treats my home state."
13406,j3xtid,"I know four of them, though they jumped off the Trump train early on.

That last part was barely comprehensible but if you aren’t wearing a mask, fuck off plague rat?"
13407,j3xtid,"But if he dies: third rate failing Walter Reed, a stupid loser hospital ...."
13408,j3xtid,He'll get great ratings too.
13409,j3xtid,"He wants to release, but it’s under audit."
13410,j3xtid,Nah the FOIA doesn’t apply to the President nor would it cover medical records.
13411,j3xtid,Yeah as I said I was initially skeptical but with the hospital stay and all the other top republicans testing positive it’s gotten too big to be plausible that he’s faking it.
13412,j3xtid,"He definitely doesn’t care if he infects other people, but every so often one of his more reluctant voters drops out, so anything that discourages a vote for him is a positive to me."
13413,j3xtid,I feel you
13414,j3xtid,"Right? I sincerely hope it’s not fatal but just enough so his views on it are drastically affected, and so will everyone who’s downplayed it. If he “dies” that’s such a bad shitstorm that everyone wishing for it really dont expect."
13415,j3xtid,Republicans: Better cut funding to Walter Reed and privatize it!
13416,j3xtid,But HIPAA does.
13417,j3xtid,I know I’ve been hearing he was being given convalescent plasma all along - so it’s still possible he’s faking even if the others aren’t. Or maybe they are? I hate that I’m even thinking this way.
13418,j3xtid,I can’t disagree with that.

Also, Clinton's leaks weren't the FBI. That was FOIA requests over the investigation plus multiple external leaks.

AFAIK none of the leaks have been from within the Russia probe, the FBI has been very quiet and leaks are from outside the bureau.

13499,7vcosk,">Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election.

It's no secret that Federal LEOs hate Dems in general, and Clinton's email server was a giant 'fuck you' to them by virtue of valuing her ability to control her account over opsec. Keep in mind that Clinton personally sent out multiple emails during her tenure reminding people that using a private account to talk about State Department issues is a security risk. Combine that with their general ire towards anyone left of Kissinger and you can see where the pressure really is.

Hell, the Comey letter wasn't leaked by the FBI, but by congress. That said, this is a big reason that the party REALLY should have focused on getting Warren to run rather than letting her get strong armed by HRC's donors. Putting all your eggs in one basket is a very very bad idea. I'm not a huge Martin O'Malley fan, but he 100% called the election, that if Clinton won the entire election would be about her emails and that messes with the parties ability to get any kind of message out.

>I'm not sure what you're talking about, AFAIK nobody knew about the laptop except for the FBI, and Comey was the sole decider for releasing that information just before the election, possibly influenced by fear of more uncontrolled leaks

You're right I got mixed up on that and the initial FOIA request.

That said, the Comey letter seemed a good idea. The main issue is they didn't write one about investigating Trump. 

My big theory is it had nothing to do with fear, but rather he 'knew' Clinton would win anyway and wanted to make sure he wasn't kicked out of the fun high level shit he loves when his own party hates him. "

Clinton, a lawyer, should have had tip top IT/ops behavior but when the FBI deliberately leaks information from ongoing investigations, let's ignore that?

Why not treat all public servants with the same scrutiny that we apply to the Clintons?

I'll just agree with you that these two investigations were handled completely unequally and leave it at that."
13502,7vcosk,"He release the information to the HIC against the advice of the Justice Department.

>The day before the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, sent a letter to Congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed Hillary Clinton email investigation, the Justice Department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy, three law enforcement officials said on Saturday.

>Senior Justice Department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter, officials said, but they did everything short of it, pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections.

>That Mr. Comey moved ahead despite those protestations underscores the unusual nature of Friday’s revelations, which added a dramatic twist to the final days of the presidential campaign. His action reignited a firestorm that Mrs. Clinton believed she had put behind her when the F.B.I. decided in July not to charge anyone in the investigation into the handling of classified information on her private email server.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html

>“Director Comey understood our position. He heard it from Justice leadership,” the official said. “It was conveyed to the FBI, and Comey made an independent decision to alert the Hill. He is operating independently of the Justice Department. And he knows it.”

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-officials-warned-fbi-that-comeys-decision-to-update-congress-was-not-consistent-with-department-policy/2016/10/29/cb179254-9de7-11e6-b3c9-f662adaa0048_story.html?utm_term=.b5c53f3ee9d5

In addition the laptop issue was withheld from the justice department and done slowly as to put the release as close to the election as possible:

>Without the involvement of their Justice Department colleagues, the F.B.I. eschewed options that might have expedited matters. Former Justice Department officials familiar with the case told me that the F.B.I.’s failure to move more quickly in this phase of the investigation represented a serious blunder. 

https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/james-comeys-conspicuous-independence

I don't think any of this was done intentionally, as Comey has been shown to be of stellar integrity but with a bit of a God complex. I do however, think this adds to the pattern of the FBI acting improperly in ways damaging to democrats, while the leaks and sloppy leadership stop when a republican is under investigation.

On a small tangent, this episode also showed how FBI also is blatantly connected to the Republican party. Giuliani bragged openly about having access to information on the investigation, and knew about the laptop before that was public."
13503,7vcosk,">Clinton, a lawyer, should have had tip top IT/ops behavior but when the FBI deliberately leaks information from ongoing investigations, let's ignore that?

Well tbf, she was the Secretary of State and her server being open game is kind of a big deal, especially compared to some lame catty targeted leaks about ongoing investigations. Surely you understand why one is a much much bigger deal to your average G man than the other? Personally I think we need to make a clear law that doing any state department work as SoS on a private server is straight up illegal regardless of your classification status so we don't have to constantly have this issue since half the SoS out there intend on becoming president and want the ability to evade FOIA. 

The answer is everything the FBI does needs to be transparent. The person they treated 'incorrectly' wasn't when they went after Clinton but rather the kid gloves they used for Trump. "
13504,7vcosk,"All state dept emails under Kerry were completely open to the russians and provably. If servers being an ""open game"" were the concern you would be more concerned about that. In contrast there is no evidence of Clinton's servers being ""open game"".

13621,j6wboz,"Not to me. Intent is a major factor in law. There's a rainthat there are degrees of murder,depending on the specifics of the crime. Crimes of passion are not as heinous as premeditated crime. So it's consistent to she that the motivation being a bias attack being punished more than other crimes even if the act is the same. Intent and motive are fundamental aspects of the criminal justice system."
13622,j6wboz,"See, the problem here is that it *seems* like a reasonable objection, but it's not.

The reasoning behind hate crimes legislation is *not* that it's ""extra bad"" that you hurt or killed somebody because of their sexuality or race, it's because your intended victim was not just one person, but a whole *group* of people. A hate crime is intended to send a violent message to an entire community, not just hurt one person.

Put it to you this way: You hate your neighbor, Mr. Jones because he's an asshole. Because you hate him, you set his garbage can on fire in his yard. Now, that's a shitty thing to do, and you've definitely committed a crime, but the only person harmed is Mr. Jones. 

Now say you hate your neighbor, Mr. Jones, because he's black. Because of that, you light a cross on his lawn.

You've not only harmed Mr. Jones, you've sent a message to every single minority person in the community: ""You are not safe here. I hate you because of who you are. I'm not alone either. I did this because I hate ALL of you."" Aside from the obvious harm to Mr. Jones, you've likely incited a severe amount of unrest, fear, and hatred in the community. You have committed a FAR larger crime now.

Same logic behind the Shepard/Bird act and things like it. A Hate Crime isn't *just* a crime against a victim. it's a crime against the entire community, and should be punished as such."

13625,j6wboz,Fact: the fact that African Americans' ancestors were sold into slavery by other Africans is congruent irrelevant to the issues faced by African Americansin America. Fact your assertion of this fact in this discussion says a lot about your worldview. Fact the claim that African Americans were bred to be tools as you described it is unfounded and disturbing.
13626,j6wboz,Ok maybe I was a bit hyperbolic but the fact is the president has spent years actively courting and encouraging white supremacist groups. Violence is an inevitable consequence as we've seen from the spike in hate crimes during his administration.
13627,j6wboz,When he called a group that included neonazis “very fine people” that sure sounds like approval of white supremacy.
13628,j6wboz,"Well, he didn’t encourage to kill black people, but he did encourage police brutality...so there’s that...a don occasion,that police brutality ends in people’s deaths."

Well I mean it's pretty obvious trump is pandering to the white supremacists, it was very obvious with the last debate. They are his base, there's no contesting that fact

Trump's history of racist remarks are well documented, I'm not interested in rehashing every one of them from the past 4+ years. If you don't think he's been courting the racist vote, you either haven't been paying attention or don't want to see what's clearly in front of your face."
13642,j6wboz,"Even Trump is smart enough not to do it completely out in the open. He does more subtely than that. He acts like racists and anti-racist protesters are equally bad. He retweets white supremacy material and then claims he didn't know it originated with racist organizations. And when asked if he denounced white supremacist groups in front of national audience he couldn't give a clear yes. Instead he waffled on about it and then blamed the violence on the left. That is simply demonstrably false. Over the past 20 years the extremist right has been far more deadly and violent than the left. 

> In the context of the question and general situation surrounding that question, I would assume that the presidents' statement was not meant to encourage racist groups, but to condemn them

Well that's the difference between me and you, I have long since stopped giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. This is exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about. He can't even unambiguously condemn white supremacists. That should been the easiest question any presidential candidate has ever been asked but he couldn't clearly and unequivocally denounce racists. Whether it's because he himself is racist or he simply doesn't want to lose their support is another matter.

As to your point about the protests being against the police and not white supremacists groups, you realize there is some not insignificant overlap between the two groups? White supremacists have actively worked to infiltrate and gain employment with the police. ""Some of those that burn crosses are the same that work forces"" and all that."
13643,j6wboz,"Of course I've met a white supremacist. I live in the midwest.

You are so weird, you denounce ""flawed logic"" and then your entire point relies on ""Have you personally met a white supremacist?""

Excuse me, are you high right now?

Maybe we can never truly know the motives of any man, but we can have a pretty good guess why the white supremacist party, encouraging the domestic terrorist organization the Proud Boys, voted against hate crime legislation.

If you have a better reason I'm all fucking ears, but if you're just going to keep going with your, ""Like what is even real man? And what can we ever even really know?"" bullshit I'm not interested"

The border's control failed to nonviolently handle people who were trying to get through a closed border. They should have planned a way to clearly explain to these people that they couldn't get through and safely get them home. They should have had people there to clearly explain to families why they couldn't get in, and how they could immigrate legally.

Tear gas isn't some horrific chemical warfare tool, it's to disperse violent crowds. (Which the caravan was.)

But this caravan is thousands large, and has never been interested in legal immigration. This was always meant to be a shock-and-awe tactic, to rush the border and hope that some make it. Once they began throwing things, tear gas WAS the appropriate response.  "
13659,a0j7hv,They shouldn't be processed at all.  Send them back.  There are people who have legally been applying for citizenship for years who dont have citizenship yet. Why should every Mexican and South American who has a rough life get a free pass into our country?  Fix your own countries.

13674,a0j7hv," They are breaking the law; violently attacking the people and infastructure put in place to protect our sovereignty. These illegals would most likely not contribute to society if allowed entry. The overburdened American taxpayer would just end up with another bill in exchange for nothing but appeasing some weak-footed liberal aims. 
 Case study: the thousands of El Salvadorian and Honduran 'children' allowed entry a few yeats ago are not acclimating well and are a huge burden on the police, courts and communities where they were settled. Gang activity (mostly MS-13 & 18th st.) is almost a chronic lifestyle for a lot of these people. I wish statistics would allow blind empathy, however pragmatism and protectionism of our own nation needs to come first. 
  George Takei has made a lot of insanely naive statements before, commenting on a range of issues with a predictable set of keywords and ideals. He was once a great and hilarious guest on the Howard Stern show, now just a man at the end of his life who fuels arguments on Twitter. He is the atypical extreme leftist who hypocritically calls for allowing an influx of illegal immigrants while he sits in his comfortable, wealthy home far from the actual pain and strain that these people would impose on the localities that they settle in.

 Imagine if the Trump doctrine was in place in years gone by. 

Where would the Irish have gone? . How about the Dutch ,the Germans, the Italians.etal.  All these people came in droves in days past, avoiding hardship in their home countries. Looking for a new life, they were able to do just that and ultimately become a part of what America is today . 

 I have always been amazed at the American phenomenon of mentally considering themselves of a different country even though born to Americans who in turn were born to Americans . 

 As a Brit born in England, and having just said such while asking the same of the American who just asked me, the typical response (like 49 out of 50) is never the home town in USA they were born but some distant tie to the foreign homeland their family originated from a century or so and several generations past.

 Yet so many of these same Americans who are so apparently tied to their foreign roots  hate the fact that people from central America only wish for the same opportunity as their Irish,Dutch,Italian,etc forefathers wanted .

We're all fucked.  There were approximately a million other ways to handle this.  Donald Trump and everyone here saying this was ok because you can't skip the line....maybe ask yourself why they are coming here.  Ask yourself what did we do in Honduras.  

Or just take a look in the mirror and say, "" I'm ok with children being assaulted with tear gas, I'm a piece of garbage.""  Because you are.

Like, paying migrants to come to the US just to whip people into a frenzy and use it as an excuse to close the border?  I know this is conspiracy level stuff, but things just don't add up to me.

First, the route they took is probably the longest possible one they could take.  Why try to sneak into California when Texas and New Mexico are so much closer?

What caused this caravan to form?  Why haven't we seen things like this before?

13712,a0j7hv,"I think you may have missed the point being made in the OP, that people would not have to cross the border ilegally if we had adequate personnel to process asylum requests. In case you're unaware all an asylum application has to do to start the process is present themselves to a border patrol agent. By law the government must process these requests.

I'm not disputing that these particular people were trying to cross ilegally, and we're repelled properly, but that doesn't change the fact that the Trump administration could have handled this in a legal, proper, and nonviolent way, and avoided the situation all together."

I also believe the process should be faster. I don’t believe breaking our laws is a way to make it that way. I think Democrat’s and Republicans can come to an agreement to better secure our borders and expedite the process on coming into the country legally but it won’t likely happen because Democrats don’t want to meet in the middle and give trump an inch of credit and Republicans are tired of being called hitler so they won’t meet in the middle."

Also sometimes paying for something via taxes is the cheaper option in the long run (i'm talking about healthcare here).

It will be a big boon to Social Security and Medicare too. "
13793,a0j7hv,"Ok this is wrong on so many levels. 

Let’s start with the good old “innocent until proven guilty” approach. Even if every single person affected their had publicly said they plan on illegally crossing the border and were indeed planning on doing that, they still are not guilty of any US crime. You can’t be guilty of something you have yet to do. This conflicts with the whole basis of the US justice system where you aren’t supposed to be punished unless you are actually found guilty of a crime. You can’t just punish someone for a doing nothing wrong because you think they will commit a crime soon. 

Next point, you’re painting all of these people as being guilty (they aren’t) by association. Let’s say a small group of a migrant caravan does indeed illegally cross the US border. That small group are now criminals according to US law. The rest of the caravan is not. They still have done nothing against US law. You can’t punish the whole group just because some members broke the law. I’ll even make this more controversial by throwing even t_d. Some members of that sub have broken the law. This is proven fact. That does not mean we can just arrest every member of that sub (yes, the sub can be banned as Reddit is a private company and can police their own site however their wish. That’s a whole other topic though). You are not just guilty by association (there is very few exceptions and this is not one of them). 

Let’s create a character. I’m going to call her Sue. Let’s say she was at the border and was with this group that we call the caravan. Sue got gassed. Can you prove that Sue specifically planned on breaking any law or planned to illegally cross the border? Can you price that Sue didn’t just want to go for a walk? Even if Sue was going to break a law, she hadn’t done it yet. You can’t prove with any significant evidence that they were going to break any laws. 

You can’t be guilty of standing near a border. What the US troops at the border did was completely unnecessary and unacceptable. If they wanted to gas the people who climbed over the wall onto American soil, that’s sadly fine. While it is still most likely an excessive use of force (depending on how many people are on both sides of the situation), at least in this case their would be a legal reasoning for their actions. 

Depending on border relations, some countries would consider this to be an act of war. The US government is continually acting more and more stupid and ignorant and it’s just going to end in us being totally secluded from a majority of the world. Nobody wants to be friends with the crazy kid committing war crimes and throwing tear gas into other countries (at foreigners who broke no US law and most likely have never even stepped on US soil in their lives). "
13794,a0j7hv,"How do you know what they were doing shit for brains? They have all said they want asylum.

13811,a0j7hv,"""Most unauthorized immigrants enter legally and by plane"". You sound very intelligent. "
13812,a0j7hv,"Bullshit. Trump can manage to lock kids in cages for months, then tent cities for months, can handle them coming over while their cases are heard. This is just to fire up his base of racists and xenophobes like you.

How do you know what they were doing shit for brains? They have all said they want asylum.

Have you heard like the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff, they'll pay you $5 million a year to rake away forest fires and fly in invisible F-35's. Is being stupid something they pay $5 million a year for because you people sure act like it is as you have stupidity in spades.

Here's the best idea. We do a one for one trade of ""he loves the uneducated"" base of Trump's knowing they'll never contribute nothing to the country but an opiate drug addiction, welfare, needing farm subsidies, etc., for a refugee willing to risk it all to get here knowing that they end up being more law abiding than the average American and their children will end up better educated and more productive for the economy than ""he loves the uneducated"" in Trump's base. It will be a big boon to Social Security and Medicare too."

13814,a0j7hv,Point taken
13815,a0j7hv,"Their move is not purely economic, that’s just a talking point to paint the other side with a broad and easy to target brush but that’s not true. 

Think about it, these guys are just walking to America’s doorstep but can’t get in. That’s not unique to this caravan, border security works. And that’s what asylum seekers are hoping for because they are running form something. A gang member that’s taken an eye for a wife or daughter. A government or violent community that condemns LGBT individuals. It could be anything and those problems can follow them across most borders, but not the US.  

It’s extremely disingenuous to say that these people are only here because jobs suck back home, that’s straight up fox level shit-speak. "

13822,a0j7hv,"> Give them jobs, income tax comes right out of the damn check.

There are many many under the table jobs in the USA. These jobs are ideal for illegal immigrants because the illegals won't be going to the cops complaining about their boss not filing proper paperwork."

13830,a0j7hv,...and that would have happened if they hadn’t tried storming past the gates but now the borders are closed.  
13831,a0j7hv,[removed]
13832,a0j7hv,"Right.  Its not necessarily a bad thing but you said that the left isnt saying to “just let them in.”  Im saying under the current system applying for asylum is the same as just letting them in because they get to stay in the U.S.  

I dont necessarily disagree with you but I think its important to frame it honestly.  "
13833,a0j7hv,"I've heard that more timed than I can count. It's always these current specific people, and when another group asks it'll be those specific people. Don't get me wrong I'm all in favour of immigration if it's productive."
13834,a0j7hv,Wait.... when did i commit overwhelming violence? Im surprised to find out that im a disgusting white supremacist arguing for a global caste system... i had no idea.

13837,a0j7hv,[removed]
13838,a0j7hv,"Maybe look into how seeking asylum works.  

And before you say, ""Well why'd they come all the way to America?""
You should also look into America's history of foreign policy in Latin America, overthrowing democratic governments, supporting brutal dictators and death squads, destroying their environments, and waging economic warfare. "
13839,a0j7hv,Wooosh
13840,a0j7hv,"No they aren't being allowed to make a claim. That's why they are all held up at the border. They are trying to do exactly what you suggest and make a claim the way most asylum seekers do. They are at a legal port of entry trying to enter and make an asylum claim. They have closed the port of entry to them, inspite of knowing they were coming and having plenty of time and resources to process them. 

Many of them did accept asylum in Mexico, over half I believe. There are a lot of reasons why they may want to be in the US instead, and it's perfectly OK and normal to have a preference. They may have some connections here already to help them get started for one. They may really like and believe in what America satands for and want to be a part of it. Is there any reason why you don't want them to apply here?

The stuff your repeating is propoganda. Your either being too lazy to educate yourself and expect to be respected for holding and repeating an opinion based in clear ignorance, or you are one of many who intentionally repeat it knowing it to be false because it acts as a smoke screen for fascists and white supremacists. If it's the former do some due diligence and educate yourself so you can meaningfully participate in your country and political discussion. Reddit isn't here to be your personal tutor. If its the later than just fuck off."
13841,a0j7hv,[deleted]
13842,a0j7hv,It’s true? Most people currently in the country illegally overstayed their visa following legal entrance by plane. 
13843,a0j7hv,"They aren’t asylum seekers. Stop abusing that word. They stopped being asylum seekers when they refused to stop on Costa Rica or Mexico. 

There’s no reason they need to come all the way to America to avoid those things. "

13850,a0j7hv,"Yeah, and illegal immigrants can't get government benefits.  So this whole ""burden on the system"" thing is a myth"
13851,a0j7hv,"Keep in mind that even without the idiotically draconian measures trump has stated 

A) undocumented immigration has dropped over the last 10 years

B) most undocumented immigrants enter the country legally, they simply overstay their VISAs.  aka they're not crossing the mexican border"
13852,a0j7hv,"I completely agree.

I may be pushing my luck here but I'm going to say it anyway, I can't believe I'm finding this much common ground on a Democrat sub. Really restoring my faith in humanity."
13853,a0j7hv,Illegal immigration is at an all time low. Fuck your stronger border security. We are at a point of diminishing returns. This is Trump whipping up racists and xenophobes like you.
13854,a0j7hv,"yes, facts are unfounded rhetoric.  time for the little alt right incel to get the old ignore button."
13855,a0j7hv,"If there is no port of entry, the proper way to apply for asylum is to cross into the US and present yourself to a member of law enforcement, the border patrol, or the TSA. You do understand that right?"
13856,a0j7hv,"Here's the best idea. We do a one for one trade of ""he loves the uneducated"" base of Trump's knowing they'll never contribute nothing to the country but an opiate drug addiction, welfare, needing farm subsidies, etc., for a refugee willing to risk it all to get here knowing that they end up being more law abiding than the average American and their children will end up better educated and more productive for the economy than ""he loves the uneducated"" in Trump's base. It will be a big boon to Social Security and Medicare too."
13857,a0j7hv,I am annoyed by these “armchair experts” passing judgement on the victims of what is essentially an American-made humanitarian crisis. The Northern Triangle region of Central America is a failure of our War on Drugs and our policy against wars of National Liberation (Nicaragua) and rebellions of Indigenous Self-Determination (Chiapas). I have been there and witnessed American Policy first-Hand. These people are refugees of our making and to have this Moron of a President treat them as criminals is beyond ironic! I blew up at the ignorant hacks who spew opinions that they glean from TrumpMedia. I apologize if I insulted you.

13859,a0j7hv,"Sure, but to instead not allow for a means of entry and to tear gas people who are as desperate and destitute as can be is just sickening "
13860,a0j7hv,"Learn some history about US involvement in Central and South America. The US has done everything from toppling democratically elected governments to training and arming right wing death squads to keep labor cheap. There wouldn't be this mass immigration in the first place if we hadn't abused and stolen from these people in the first place. People don't up and move en masse for no reason. American foreign policy for the past hundred years has been to do anything necessary to keep the people of Central and South America subservient to American corporations. Then, when people follow their stolen wealth we set up fences and keep them away with guns. 

If you don't want to be called a white supremacist then stop supporting white supremacist policies. The issue of immigration does not happen in a vacuum. The way our immigration system is set up in the context of our foreign policy is very much a white supremacist or at the very least imperialist policy designed to suppress people whose only fault is being born on the wrong side of a line. The only way current anti-immigration arguments can not be racist is if you ignore all historical and geopolitical context."
13861,a0j7hv,This is one of the most reasonable things I’ve seen said about this all day.

What good reason do they have to not accept asylum in Mexico?

Lol I love how hostile you are. You wonder why democrats are so divided.

Do you have a source for these claims?

I guess I have been reading ""propoganda"" but I am also unable to find a source where asylum seekers who have not entered the country illegally, are being denied.

Get off your fucking high horse also, Jesus.

Edit: I realize and agree that we need more officials to process the applicants more quickly. I understand the legal process is far too slow.

I just don't see a problem with stopping those entering who are entering illegally. Are you claiming none are entering illegally? That it's ""propoganda"" that they are entering illegally? 

Meanwhile we have multiple credible stories claiming it happend. Is the BBC ""propoganda""?

I simply said anyone trying to enter illegally should be stopped. You are saying they are not entering illegally. So we agree. If they are legally doing it I have no problem.

Don't be such an extremist."
13878,a0j7hv,Or you fucking wait for the border to reopen.
13879,a0j7hv,So there going to travel all through Mexico on roads leading to points of entry but then decide to take a a side road? Mmmkay. 
13880,a0j7hv,"Nobody is passing judgement. It’s not our problem. Sadly they got the shit end of the history stick. But there certainly isn’t any reason to take in a bunch of impoverished uneducated refugees. We want intelligent, educated immigrants. Not these people. There’s nothing wrong with Mexico or Costa Rica. I’d be more than happy living in either place. "
13881,a0j7hv,">as desperate and destitute as can be

I dont really agree with this.  Sure some of them may be but you also have to consider the fact that they did not claim asylum in Mexico.  Also the reports of them being ungrateful and demanding of Mexican resources given to them.

Its becoming clear that while they may have legitimate reasons to leave their home country, them coming all the way to the US is a purely economic move"

14069,j4niml,"Eh, this is pretty dumb tbh.

Most countries have private insurance supplementing a public option, carbon tax, many countries do not even have a minimum wage (just collective bargaining), lower corporate taxes, lower trade barriers/more FTAs, just as unfettered capital markets/banking, etc. And america is pretty unique in that it's unions aren't related/tied to capital markets/corporate boards.

And even the things they do have that we don't have tradeoffs. Free college in europe doesn't include dorms, and class sizes are far larger with far fewer degree options. Most students live at home outside the US and UK and take classes with 200 other students.

Gas in Europe is also like 8 dollars a gallon instead of 2-4, which is definitely a tax on lower income people rather than wealthy.

Leftist parties in Europe really are basically just the justice democrats in america and have to coalition with a center left party to do literally anything. On balance it's almost identical to the democratic party in the US on aggregate tbh."

14109,j4niml,"Having health insurance provided through your employer is a ridiculous system. Employers see it as an expense that needs to be cut... usually by reducing what is covered. 

The employers also like to put waiting periods for coverage. Industries with high turnover have up to three month waiting periods if you switch jobs. 

Pool size (number of people covered) reduces the individual cost, so larger employers get cheaper insurance. No employer has as large a pool as Medicare/Medicaid. 

Almost no first world countries have employer provided health insurance. The only reason we do is that the Republicans want us indebted to our employers like a modern day feudal system."

14117,j4niml,"Considering Bernie and AOC are only advocating for things Scandinavia (and the rest of the industrialized world) already has, I’d call them conservative compared to the rest of the world."
14118,j4niml,"The whole left for Scandinavian counties thing is largely untrue in nearly every way. 

Not sure why you're saying that, or why anyone would believe it. 

Their healthcare plans match up pretty well with over a dozen countries in Europe, for instance. Free college also exists in over 20 countries already (or so cheap it might as well be). 

And plans they want to enact don't mean we will get that exact version. Comparing their ideal to the reality of a country that has already implemented these things is pretty disingenuous. And calling those ideas left in comparison when they are largely _the same_ as the implemented versions is definitely so. 

By and large Bernie would be pretty center left in most of Europe, and not much further left than that."
14119,j4niml,"Everything you're saying is largely true, but misleading. 

For instance, gas being more expensive. That ignores that these countries largely don't require private car ownership. They invested in and maintain their public transportation, so that isn't a hidden tax on the poor there... Because they don't drive! They don't need to.

That's like saying the cost of gas in the USA is a hidden tax on the people living in NYC, even though most of the population there don't drive to get around. 

So for anyone reading what this person is saying, take it with a huge dose of salt."
14120,j4niml,The fact that free University in Europe doesn’t pay for accomodation is a bit disingenuous given that you have to pay for both college and accomodation in the US
14121,j4niml,"Private insurance is rare in most European countries and is only used to get faster treatment. Take the UK as an example, only the top few % of high earners have private supplemental health insurance. The National Health Service is paid for by taxes and provides world class health care for any and all ailments without a single penny being given for treatment aside from prescriptions which cost about $10 each (if you can afford to pay). British people pay their taxes and the government takes care of the health of the population in a fair and equitable way.

In the US, the insurance companies sit between the patient and the healthcare provider and they make billions simply by being there. The whole service costs a fortune BECAUSE they are there siphoning money. In a system without insurance companies, healthcare becomes affordable and fair.

As for the position of the parties. And staying on the UK for the comparison. In policies the Democrats are much more akin to the Conservatives in the UK than they are to either Labour or the Liberal Democrats. So US liberal is definitely much more European middle.

On gas prices, yes they are really high in Europe because the governments are not controlled by Petrochemical companies. They raise taxes on fuels that damage the environment and the petrochemicals companies have been told for years to use their money to invest in green energy. 

Here’s the most important thing: you cannot lobby in the UK. You cannot do shady deals to ask questions in Parliament, politicians do not become rich and there is a cap on how much money they can spend on campaigning for election.

Sorry for the rambling but my point is that Democrats are not really “left” it’s just that the Republicans are so far right that everyone else is to their left.

Edit: not suggesting that corruption in politics doesn’t occur in the UK, Boris Johnson is pretty shady. I’m just saying that wholesale lobbying by rich companies for support that directly damages the health and well-being of the electorate does not happen. Most US politicians are able to become very rich whilst in office which is suspicious. 

And being able to buy your way to office is inherently wrong. Give them all the same cap on campaign expenditure and make it a level playing field. It’s like Formula 1 - all the cars are limited to the same base technology performance and its the skill of the drivers that shines through.

Edit: Thank you for the gold. I will also say that it’s disheartening that on this Democrat sub the majority downvote any comment that even whiffs of criticism of the US political system or the US in general. If you will not accept the frailties of your system and campaign to improve it then you will forever be locked in this ridiculous bipartisan battle that simply lines the pockets of a fortunate few by removing money, freedom and ultimately the lives of the common person."
14122,j4niml,"The left in the US is generally considered right of the middle in European countries.

Edit: vote me down as much as you want. The US democratic parties policies have more in common with the conservative party in the UK than the labour party. And the Tories are more right wing than the majority of conservative parties in Europe"

14131,j4niml,What are some of those ideologies?
14132,j4niml,"Uhhh. Was with you until the end when you started saying stupid shit. 

There are at least 19 countries in Europe alone that qualify for single payer universal healthcare. 

Free college is a little harder. But most sources say there are about 20 countries that qualify or are so cheap it may as well be free. 

15 dollar minimum wage is harder, but mostly because most countries don't pay so little to begin with as they have working unions and workers rights. So for instance, the lowest wages in Denmark are 15 or higher but they don't have a minimum wage... Because it isn't necessary for them to achieve that level of basic pay. 

Guaranteed federal jobs, and rent control weren't on his platform last I checked. That sounds mostly like propaganda garbage. 

And in fact by checking his platform yourself you'll find those don't exist!

Some things Americans do lifestyle wise enable policies that are much more realistic for us (ADA, for example, is the gold standard globally) that would be impossible in Europe (zero chance ADA could ever happen). Home ownership among lower and middle class in the US is also *far* above Europe even as it gets more challenging.

For one, most of them are mixed public-private where there is a baseline subsidization for most healthcare, but people are allowed to purchase private insurance that offers them faster, more flexible care if they want to. [Compare this to Bernies plan where he said he would make it illegal to sell insurance that covers things already covered by Medicare-for-All.](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/politics/medicare-for-all-annotated/)

Additionally, almost all of them have some form of cost-sharing, either in the form of copays, coinsurance, or deductibles. There are important to prevent a tragedy of the commons scenario of abuse and overuse. Compare that to Bernie's plan where there is no form of cost sharing at all.

Furthermore, not all of the systems listed cover prescriptions, when Bernie has said will be fully covered and with no copays. 

Overall Bernie's plan went far beyond what is offered in any of the countries you listed."

You and people like you are the reason american politics is so toxic.

Also you asking about Romania is adorable as I lived there and their level of healthcare is unusable for any one who has had any sort of experience in America. Public hospitals in Romania are a non option. Completely unusable for any sort of actual life threatening situation. I personally waited 1 hour in an ER having moderate to severe asthma attacks."
14171,j4niml,Bernie's plan goes a lot farther than those countries. It's not just a nationalized healthcare plan that he was talking about but also the extent of the plan. Those countries you listed also include copays for procedures and also don't ban private insurance.

14192,j4niml,">  Not Canada or the UK sure, but not all universal healthcare systems look like theirs.

Point of clarity I want to add, not a disagreement.  The United Kingdom and Canada do not have the same healthcare system.  

Canada has a single payer system, where the proinces and territories pay for healthcare provided by a multitude of providers.  Some of these are publicly funded by the province and some are private.  Doctors have to get reimbursed for care from the province when they treat someone in most cases.  This is broadly similar to what they have in France and the Netherlands.

In the UK, they have a single provider system.  This means the government of the United Kingdom directly pays the doctor for their services and almost every doctor is employed by the NHS.  In a single provider system, all services are both paid for and provided by the same organization, typically the government.  You can take your healthcare needs out of the NHS System if you so choose, but you will have to pay for it yourself."
14193,j4niml,"So. In another post I specifically listed 19 European countries with healthcare plans that are very similar to Bernie's. France is on that list. Germany is not. But france is one of the least matching out of a list of nearly 20 nations in just Europe that have nationalized universal healthcare.

If you want I can list them here for you. But the point remains that what you're saying isn't accurate.

Edit:
Albania, Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, UK. 

Feel free to check. This is from Wikipedia's list of universal healthcare countries. I just did Europe alone. I ignored any that were only mandinated private insurance. Instead these are all fully nationalized universal healthcare. But many do also allow for private insurance on top, and Bernie's plan would as well technically since he never on his platform calls for banning or outlawing it."
14194,j4niml,[removed]
14195,j4niml,"I mean. I guess you can claim whatever lie you want. 

But the facts remain the facts. 

If you can find me some Scandinavian politicians on the left or in the center who call Bernie's plan left of them that would be good. 

Alternatively if you could somehow be specific about what in his policies he wanted that would be considered left of their center and why. 

Otherwise, you're just a lying jackass."
14196,j4niml,"Ugh. 

Here is home ownership:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate

And how is the cost of gasoline a hidden tax for people in NYC if they don't use it? What kind of mental gymnastics is that!?

Just... I am going to assume you mean well, but nothing you're saying is actually usefully true.

Or you're purposely misleading people."

The Tories line up with the GOP in policies, in their politics and tactics, and sometimes even in the people (they're supported and funded by the same people - Cambridge Analytica, Murdoch, Mercer, etc). People ITT and elsewhere seem to be confusing the Coalition government (led by David Cameron) for the Tory party. It's the post-2015 government(s) that's indicative of what the Tory party truly is.


   
    
The Tories are very socially conservative. David Cameron legalized gay marriage under pressure from his coalition partners, the Lib Dems (Lynn Featherstone). All this general assumption about the Tories being center or ""gently center-right"" seem to stem from the Coalition years where the Lib Dems managed to pull them off the brink. All you've seen since 2015 (Brexit, racism, Jo Cox, food banks, etc) is what the Tories truly are without their extremism being tempered."
14202,j4niml,"No they are definitely closest to the tories. The Lib Dems are our centre party and have just said they back [universal basic income](https://www.libdems.org.uk/a20-ubi) which seems pretty far to the left of the democrats and labour are further left than them. 
The Tories legalised gay marriage, raised minimum wage recently and although they don't like the NHS, they choose not to get rid of it. which I think puts them closer to democrats than republicans.
We don't have a large party as far right as the republicans, the closest I guess would be UKIP or the Brexit party."

About half of them are mixed. At least 10 aren't.  

And many of them _don't_ have some form of cost sharing that you listed. 

Bernie's plan fits firmly among the nations I listed. While some are as you describe, though that is significantly closer to Bernie's plan than any other alternative we are discussing, many are emphatically not!

Also, Bernie's plan doesn't make private insurance as a whole illegal. Several of those counties have no private insurance at all. 

And I can't find where he makes it illegal in any sense in his own policies.

Edit:
I have been shown that he would look to disallow private insurance for things the single payer covers, but would allow for supplemental insurance for things it doesn't. This is largely in line with the rest of the developed world's health insurance systems. And explicitly does not look to completely ban private insurance."
14208,j4niml,"Did they really call it nationalizing of an industry. Holy shit. Come on. That article even explicitly cuts out the second part of section 107 and just boils it down. The section 107 part on insurance still being allowed is damn near fewer words than they used to sum it up. 

Bernie’s plan has problems. But all legislation does. It’s a starting point to get to a better place, not the finish line."
14209,j4niml,"That twitter thread is sensationalized, and has cherry picked statistics, and ignores that while the goal is one thing the reality will be closer to the nations she is listing. 

It is just complaining to say because it is impossible to reach the idealized goal they want, they must be lying and it isn't worth even attempting or bothering to do anything about it. 

That was awful, and I think I lost brain cells trying to keep up with the rhetoric and it's complete lack of intellectual dishonesty."
14210,j4niml,"He asked me to name 1. I named 19. 

And if you can't show me where his policy is claiming to ban private insurance, then it is a lie. Period. 

You may have been told it. But he isn't asking for it on his platform. Therefore you're either misled or a liar. 

Pick whether you want to be a dumbass or a jackass. I'm just telling you and others the facts. 

I am also going above and beyond. I'm researching each of your claims to see if you are right. 

In reality the onus of burden of proof is on you and him and all the rest. You're making a claim, you have to support it. 

You're welcome for doing the work you're too lazy and intellectually dishonest to bother with."
14211,j4niml,"Most of the countries I mentioned don't have private health insurance or co pays. Perhaps about half. 

So no, that's not true either. 

Also, I don't recall his plan banning private health insurance. 
And lo! If you check his plan or his platform it didn't mention banning private health insurance either.

So while I am wrong in that he didn't say it, he did. It isn't some far left concept in that several other major economies have similar plans in place. 

And it looks like I misread the jobs guarantee. You're correct. That is a part of the proposed policy. Weirdly, he isn't the only democratic candidate to float that idea? And his idea wasn't even the most left wing or radical. 

Apparently Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker _also_ had that policy position.

14240,j4niml,"S1129, “Medicare for All” Bill, introduced April 10, 2019, Title 1, Section 107 states:

>(a) In General.—Beginning on the effective date described in section 106(a), it shall be unlawful for—
>
>
>
>>(1) a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act; or

>(2) an employer to provide benefits for an employee, former employee, or the dependents of an employee or former employee that duplicate the benefits provided under this Act.

> (b) Construction.—Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting the sale of health insurance coverage for any additional benefits not covered by this Act, including additional benefits that an employer may provide to employees or their dependents, or to former employees or their dependents.

The next section goes on to specify that private insurance is banned only from providing comparable services already provided for by M4A. This seems likely to prevent the wealthy from attempting to create a two tier system. Without this provision, the wealthy could just create their own health insurance plans and create networks for themselves. The whole point of the bill is to create equitable healthcare access for all Americans. Health insurance could still exist for services not covered by the public plan. The link at the bottom takes you directly to the referenced section.

His goes goes much farther than every other country in the world. For instance, it completely covers dental and vision. It sets a price cap on prescription drugs rather than the collective bargaining that is often said.

So, thanks for finding the exact lines and showing that he doesn't want to ban private insurance wholesale.

https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1175834645981736962?s=20

He did put a policy forward that was kind of favorable to landlords however where rent control would be 3% increase or 1.5 consumer price index. The 3% seems low, but generally consumer price index is 2% or lower. If inflation becomes say 4%, then rent could be increased by 6%. Etc. 

If anything his one proposal is one of the most generous and friendly to landlords found for states that already have some form of rent control (Like Oregon). 

This however doesn't seem to be a bill, and it doesn't seem he is married to his numbers or the concept, as it never got fully fleshed out on his site or down the road. 

And when comparing to other countries, it seems as if 2016 at least 14 of the 36 OECD countries (western countries that at well off) have rent control. So it isn't some kind of far left idea in a lot of other western nations. https://www.oecd.org/els/family/PH6-1-Rental-regulation.pdf

And yes I noticed. You're doing a great job and we can discuss it and how it may seem. But most other people seem to not even do that or bother. It's strange and weird and very frustrating. Especially the healthcare stuff. 

Because of you I found that proposal involving his policy on rent control, and would not have. So thanks!

I am happy to admit he called for rent control as a proposal, his proposal was more center or right of center than many of the states that have it and many of the countries that also gave it. And that it was a platform but not written in stone how or to what extent it would have been pursued."

14274,j4niml,I didn’t know states had rent control outside of large metropolitan areas like NYC. I recall hearing about the 3% cap causing problems because it asp incentivized landlords to always raise rent. If I’m dapped at 3% per year than every year I fail to increase rent I have reduced the future value of my property. The same is not true of not raising rent in an environment without rent control. It also can create perverse incentives for folks building apartments and disadvantage poorer folks.

It's not about whether you support him or not. I don't really care either way. 

I just want any claims that are made to be truthful. As far as I can tell, yours are not (I just checked the healthcare of most of those counties for some other people making ridiculous claims). 

I am happy to change my tune with sufficient evidence and have provided what I would accept as examples. That's how I work. Based on evidence and sourced facts. At least to the best of my ability. 

I'm simply holding your claims to that same standard so that others reading will realize it doesn't pass muster. 

Or... You'll show I'm wrong and I'll admit and they, as well as myself, will learn something.

14284,j4niml,"It likely wouldn't cover elective treatments or things like plastic surgery that isn't reconstructive. Or non generic drugs. 

Or if it did it may not fully cover it. Things like that are generally where private insurance shines. 

But to reiterate, countries with no private insurance at all aren't rare. Nor are countries that only have private insurance for these kinds of elective procedures and products. 

So even if he does intend to ban all private insurance, that doesn't make it a radical left idea when it is so common across the world and in peer western nations. 

But he isn't looking to ban them outright anyway. The bill itself he proposed directly provisions for the ability to have private insurance. It wasn't like it was even left out. Private insurance was not totally disallowed."
14285,j4niml,"Yes. 4 states I believe have it. 

There are definitely dangers of it. There are also issues with not doing it. But at least in the context of this thread it isn't some far left unacceptable position, if we can discuss the merits of it or the merits of his proposal (not bill or law). 

It seems to be a pretty common and acceptable practice among a large portion of our economic peers, and several prosperous states seem to be using to to some effect. Whether that is good or bad or the right choice is a different story, but it certainly doesn't make Bernie some extreme leftist when it is that common."

The point remains that his bill expressly allows for private insurance to exist. It's named as such.

That Russia interfered is noise, that isn't the news, that is what people are trying to make the headline, this has and always will happen and is pretty much meaningless. That they almost certainly colluded with the Trump campaign to make it happen is exceptionally bad. 

It's very different to say I'm doing this thing just because I want to, and saying hey, if I help you do your thing, give me something in return for that help. So Russia helping someone specific, talking about it and then having influence is the part to worry about and the part that is completely illegal for American citizens to take part in.

I also shit post in pokemongo, use Cryllic alphabet, refer to peoples weight in KG, keep up with the current conservative shit-post talking points and just happen to comment in a thread for a sub I've never been on before with a bunch of like minded people."
14352,86782s,Whataboutwhataboutwhatabout. Frigg off 
14353,86782s,Nah liberals can accept that was a wrong move. While also acknowledging it was a move meant to go in a conciliatory direction. The situation wasn’t good then but it’s much worse now.
14354,86782s,"Even if that was the case, why does that make it OK for Trump to do it?   The wrong thing to do is still the wrong thing to do.  He did it so I can is what a 2 year old uses as an excuse. "

Dude got owned by Romney, and the left thought Obama's smirking dismissal that ""this isnt the '80s"" was some epic win, and not a complete faceplant. 

Wrong is wrong. This post is wrong. Trump is letting America get played like a fiddle, while Obama was. "

14370,86782s,"I think they're referring to Putin's presidency. He was in office for most of the 00's and this shit wasn't exactly hidden.

When I heard Trump congratulated him and saw the initial outrage, my first reaction was ""This is a bad move, I'd be shocked if Obama hadn't congratulated him"". Trump seems to love whoever he's talking to at any moment until they challenge him. He spent half a campaign hollaring about holding KSA accountable for 9/11 and the moment he went there he grabbed a glowing orb and had a great time and did a 180. "

Actually, Dmitry Medvedev was President from 2008 to 2012, which was all of Obama's first term.  But Putin was also President between 2000 and 2008, so you are correct to say Putin was in office for most of the 00's.

14383,86782s,"Oh those people are annoying as shit. 

Obama and Putin actually got along pretty well relatively speaking, which is why focusing on Trump being 'friends' with him rather than just focusing on his blatant corruption and profiting off these interactions seemed like a failing strategy to me. "

FOH"
14390,86782s,"Sorry but this is revision people engage in to make Obama look better. Putin created the lead up to the GR war, and oversaw it as PM while he was out of his presidency because of constitutional incumbency requirements. By 2006 we already knew Putin was targeting Russian journalists and politicians and assassinating them. He had a huge record of keeping political prisoners before Obama was even in office as well as violent targeted efforts against Chechnyans.

14391,86782s,There’s no reason to dignify such a stupidly arrogant statement with a response. 
14392,ik3lfa,"Progress is a path, not a destination. One candidate is doing their best to undue/turn back any progress our Country has made in the past 74 years and pushes hate and division.

14397,ik3lfa,"A lot of the neverBiden folks are alt-right trolls pretending to be progressives, here's how you spot them:

1. They are preoccupied with an enemy. Biden, Pelosi, the DNC, CNN, etc, etc. Very little focus on policy or progress, their posts are always focused on ""the enemy"".
2. Their posts will devolve into ""stigginit"". Lots of talk about teaching a lesson, again little talk about progress and policy. 
3. They are preoccupied with the past, especially past misdeeds from their preferred enemy. 
4. Whataboutism. Nothing you say, no points you make will be addressed. e.g. point out something good that The Enemy has done recently and they'll point to something from 20 years ago. 

I saw this on r/WayOfTheBern. Took me a while to realize there weren't any actual progressives left on that forum."

He's had brain surgery for aneurysms. he ain't young, but right now, we NEED an elder statesman with the chops not only to defeat The Orange idiot, but to remake the Democracy so this can't EVER fucking happen again."

They could have run literally any of the other 70 candidates and I would have gladly voted for them, but they had to pick the guy who made a name for himself ruining generations of families because prisons needed to be filled.

Because she would just eat 45 for breakfast. But I'm holding my nose and voting for Biden, because I'm a one issue voter.  I didn't have a choice in 1973"
14447,ik3lfa,"NO this is wrong.  This is an aweful comparison.  We fuck strangers and people we don't like or love. We marry people for so many reasons but we also divorce them day in day out.  And neither fucking or marrying gets us a free and democratic society.  **But a vote can!**

Many people aren't married or fucking anyone but they can still vote.

Many people until recently couldn't marry or fuck the people they wanted because of a lack of representation ...which only now exists due to the vote.

Our vote goes beyond the pleasure or fucking or the union of marriage.  Our vote is everything and over rules almost everything else.  

So we don't make careless or uninformed votes.  You know what a party vote looks like ? Donald fucking trump. That's what you get when you choose the party over the individual for president. Not other positions but with president the candidate matters!

So if you like Biden you vote for him. **If you like trump you vote for him.** If you don't like either....YOU STILL VOTE FOR FUCKING BIDEN as it's not like you're marrying or fucking him!!!"

Think ""wearing masks"" and ""social distancing""  but ideas like maintaining our natural resources or fighting climate change are dismissed the same way.

Trump on the other hand, has and continues to undo and pillage the path of the future, stunting any progress towards those goals. Sit down and do some serious reading on the differences between the GOP platform and the disaster in their wake, and the progressive Democratic Party platform and things being pushed for and planned for as we speak to make American lives better now and in the future.

>Fuck Joe Biden and Fuck Donald Trump.

I agree!

Unfortunately, the guys in the lab say they'll need an ""indefinite amount of time"" to complete the machine that will take you to your ideal alternate reality :(

In the mean time, you'll have to continue living in this decidedly imperfect reality which means making choices among decidedly non-ideal, (and in some instances, fucking awful) options.

I don't think people appreciate how close we are to unbridled authoritarian fascism. And if it takes hold in the USA, the rest of the world is fucked. We have an almost insurmountable geographic and economic/natural resource advantage, not to mention thousands of nuclear devices. There won't be any D-Day, no push back against the beast, no liberation. Not for a very very long time."
14509,ik3lfa,"Well, the other option is Trump and that hurts way more. If anyone is hold a gun to our heads it’s Trump and Republicans. There are exciting candidates up and down the ballot, so it’s not like there’s no one to get interested in. We need to work on our bench and now’s the time."
14510,ik3lfa,"How old are you? Have you heard the story of Ralph Nader, Al Gore, and George W Bush? That’s why you don’t vote Green. The shit that’s gone wrong in the past 20 years is because people thought Al Gore was too robotic and not progressive enough. Well, instead of a center left Democrat, we got two endless wars and a global economic crisis."
14511,ik3lfa,"So does that mean you’re starting your own party? Are you going to build a coalition, make a platform, get people elected at the state and local level so that, eventually, a person who’s a president would have people to work with? Otherwise you’re just being selfish. I mean, it’s your choice, but unless you’re going to work to be represented, you’re just complaining."
14512,ik3lfa,"This is nuts. Do you have any friends? Compromise is a part of life. You don’t get to be the boss of 300 million people who all have different views. What you can do is the least harm to the people you purport to care about. The choice isn’t between Biden and someone else who is perfect to you. It’s between Biden and Trump. By not choosing Biden, you are choosing Trump and causing greater suffering.   

And let me ask you, what have you done to advance all these causes you purport to care about? I’ll tell you what I did. I started a PAC to raise money for state and local candidates in flippable states. Is Biden my ideal candidate. No, but he’s a HELL of a lot better than Trump. And then I got my ass of the couch and started a movement in my own community. And maybe one of the people were supporting today will be the next Obama or Booker or Warren. You need to think bigger and get back to reality."
14513,ik3lfa,And you are welcome to do that
14514,ik3lfa,Eh.. pretty sure you want to fuck him?
14515,ik3lfa,Worked for Trump. Now look where we are.
14516,ik3lfa,"It is when the other candidate that can win is Donald Trump.

(Also, you're misinterpreting the tweet. I don't love ""The Force Awakens,"" but I didn't hate it, either.)"
14517,ik3lfa,So you want the guy that walked into the dressing room for Miss Teen America while they were in various stages of dress to remain the president?
14518,ik3lfa,"My recommendation is to find people up and down the ballot to get excited about. We need to build our bench and now is the time. We were totally flat footed in the Obama years because we were focused at the top. Not sure where you live, but chances are there’s an opportunity to flip a state house or elect new judges in your state. Redistricting is on the ballot this year so we need to do more than just hold our noses and vote at the top of the ticket. We have to get people out!"
14519,ik3lfa,"It’s so absurd to vote for a third party in a presidential election. All these people bitch and moan about the two party system from the 4th of July to Election Day every 4 years and then disappears. You want a third party? Start at the local level. Get people elected. Organize. Get people elected to state houses and then congress. There’s not a world in which a third party option materializes without people investing time in it. Politics is about representation. If you don’t feel like you’re being represented, do something over a sustained period of time. But complaining in practically September of an election year? Nah, that’s not the way."

14524,ik3lfa,"Ummm, do you not remember 4 years ago?

The shift from Obama to trump was exactly what you say. I get all the edgy kids that cut themselves like to pretend change is impossible, but I don’t want you playing with those kids any more. That Tommy Whittaker is a bad apple"
14525,ik3lfa,Why are yall booing him! He's right!
14526,ik3lfa,"> Maybe the thing they don't like about him is his capability to be President...

It's rarely that. Most often, it's some aesthetic frustration with his campaign or the fact that his name isn't Bernie Sanders. When you show these people his policies, they support all of them. When you tell them they're from Biden, they say some nonesense about how they ""don't love him.""

It's tedious. There's a whole faction of the electorate who's brains have been melted by stan culture around politicians. It's weird."
14527,ik3lfa,"Sorry, no. Carrying out your civic duty shouldn’t be rooted in emotion. Do you need to feel ecstasy and euphoria when you pick out a doctor or settle on a dentist? Voting is hiring someone to do a job for you. You should pick the person best able to do that based on the available candidates. Period"

14531,ik3lfa,"Wow, sorry to hear that."
14532,ik3lfa,Then you can't say you don't like him. Only people who like him and hate America are voting for Trump. Be a mature adult and vote for Biden or be an Anti-American nut and vote for Trump.
14533,ik3lfa,"Yeah I agree; I came around to support Bernie/Warren as well, but Biden is great given the available options. He’s also very willing to adjust with the party and has a very progressive set of policy proposals currently.

Trump is just a lying dirtbag; same as he always was back when he was squandering his several hundred million dollar inheritance by running casinos into bankruptcy and getting fired as CEO. You could even say trump is nothing but a LOSER; someone once said that we should be looking for a WINNER."

14542,ik3lfa,I'm a veteran and boomer. But I can see past the bullshit of tRump and his administration. I'm a life time Democrat. The last time I voted Republican was Bush Sr. I just glad my kids and most of my friends are smart enough to see tRump for the fraud he is. Blue wave people.
14543,ik3lfa,It’s an old saying
14544,ik3lfa,There were choices. And people did not vote for them. The one with the most votes became the presidential nominee. That's how a democracy is supposed to work.
14545,ik3lfa,"he HAS no platform; he intends to do nothing, which is what the Republican party has been doing; well, with the exception of stuffing as many Republican ass-lickers into the Regional Supreme Courts as they possibly can, hoping to forestall the prosecutions than will SURELY be coming if and when the Democrats take over."
14546,ik3lfa,I just can't imagine anyone's apathy or even antipathy towards Biden trumping their hate of Trump.

I don't have any ponies, but I am excited about how you personally could make the world better in the next few years, in some way big or small. We're all counting on you to bring your A game. Now, vote for Biden."
14550,ik3lfa,[removed]
14551,ik3lfa,Which pretty much means this wouldn't be America anymore in anything but name.
14552,ik3lfa,"I think part of the issue for some progressives is that, no, Biden is not good enough as far as his policies go, and part of the progressive platform is that not good enough means bad. That could mean a more stagnant platform for 8 years, and for the following Democratic nominee, there will not be as much pressure to move the platform to the left and then we could get *another* candidate in the same vein as Biden. That should continue to be fought for on state and local levels, because getting those representatives in will still put pressure on the Democrats. 

At this point, I think that I’d rather see Biden actually elected than protest with my vote and lose another election to that toad. I’d rather bide my time with Biden than right-wing extremists."

14563,ik3lfa,"What? This underlying hyper-individualism has been present in the US since its birth. The fundamental hyper-individualistic culture has been present in American culture since the first drawing of the articles of confederation. 

Just because you have lived a privileged life in suburbia for most of your life doesn’t mean that after 2016 everything changed. The open air atrocities that happen now are merely a result of actions by the American government and people, no longer being able to hide under the veil of “peaceful times”. 

“True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of justice” as MLK once said.

The “Justice For All” part of the pledge of allegiance has almost never been shown throughout the history of US, especially in the last 100 years.

Also maybe you’re having a mid life crisis or something but quit it with the garbage condescending redditor talk. Just makes you look pathetic."
14564,ik3lfa,"Right. But sometimes there’s a candidate that really seems like they would make the country a better place, and people get inspired and hopeful for that future, which all comes to a climax of excitement and anticipation during voting / Election Day. 

However, here in America, we tend to be forced into voting for moderates who don’t really inspire or excite anyone but are agreed to be the most electable by one of the two parties, and the gerrymandered districts or solid red/blue states make a lot of votes meaningless. So yeah, in America, voting is typically boring and uninspiring.

Not to say voting isn’t important, but it could be better."
14565,ik3lfa,"I agree that it's a civic duty and it shouldn't be rooted in emotion, but the problem is that the candidates you believe in have no chance of winning and therefore you lose your representation because of the party duopoly, and therefore you are forced to vote for a lesser evil which won't even represent you, but rather represent his or hers big donors. That is not called a democracy, that is a plutocracy. 
In a democracy every vote is very potent and counts and therefore represent every citizen. In the current system in America if your candidate does not win you lose all your representation which in many eyes is not democracy."
14566,ik3lfa,">You should pick the person best able to do that based on the available candidates.

Unfortunately, that doesn't work in the US. Here, we have to evaluate from the candidates most likely to get elected, rather than the best candidate.  When our favored candidate is eliminated, we don't recover our vote to give to our second favorite.  Here, we disenfranchise ourselves as soon as we vote for someone other than the two most likely candidates. Worse, our favorite and second favorite are likely to split the vote, and hand the election to an undesirable candidate. 

No, we are forced to vote strategically, which means from our pool of acceptable candidates, we have to select the one most likely to win, rather than the best candidate."
14567,ik3lfa,About half of America would disagree.
14568,ik3lfa,"Huh? Why are you generalizing. There’s plenty of non-radical people who are educated and not voting for Biden and ARE voting for Trump.

Trump is the exception to presidents and most politicians actually TRY to get their goals accomplished even if it requires time and negotiations. Biden was a big part of getting Obama era policies passed and I don't think he ran for the most complex job in the world to sit on his thumbs all day. What evidence from Biden's reccord in the Senate or as VP indicates he just won't try and do what he said he wants to do? Listen Biden wasn't in my top five, I was a Warren gal, but we can't be effective at political change if the only reason we critique our allies is a vague and unsubstantiated feeling that he won't do anything.

How did these civil rights come about? Through violent means. Women and African Americans weren’t given rights willingly, it only happened due to global warfare against regimes that presented racism/sexism as a complete/total package rather than the covered version the US presented. 

America is not doomed to never change, I’m only saying to remove the dominance of the hyper-individualistic culture America has plagued into the world, violence will be inevitable to change the fundamental cultural aspects of this country.

No one's ""entitled"" to anyone's vote. Your vote shouldn't have to be earned. Voters have responsibilities too. To be informed and make the best choice. It's height of arrogance and entitlement to withhold a vote because you didn't feel woo'd. Make a choice. Make it the most informed you can. Or don't vote and don't bitch about the outcome."
14622,ik3lfa,"That reasoning is so broad it could apply to anyone. ""It's well known politicians don't keep all their promises so we can't guarantee that Bernie will actually implement his policies."" It's not a critique based on Bidens action or history and its root comes from the perception of politicians rather than a pattern of behavior. It's not a valid conclusion.

Most of his major speeches don't even directly address Trump. His DNC speech stated several political goals he wanted to achieve including Climate Change. He has had three or Four press briefings on his Build Back Better plans for economic recovery and improvement. I'm subscribed to him and he sends updates on when new policy is on his website. Which you should probably go read to see the extensive planning on his part. He's adopted policies from Warren and Sanders that are progressive and continues to be in contact with both of them. Most people don't care about policy. When I was campaigning for Warren most average people didn't care when I mentioned specific policy, they liked her spirit and her image as a fighter. Some were interested in her plans but mostly just trusted her to be smart. Joe is trying to communicate to those voters because we policy wonks are in line already. Also if you really care about policy you go to their website and do your own research. 

https://joebiden.com/racial-economic-equity/

https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/

Here's two of FOUR plans on just the Economy. There's a ton on the website in general

Also if he doesn't do what you think he should then organize and hold feet to the fire. People protested Obama and it shifted some of what they did policy wise. We get the results we fight for."
14623,ik3lfa,"Has Trump ""earned"" your vote?

Politicians have a responsibility to make their case to voters. But voters have responsibilities too. To be informed and make a choice. The only thing you need is to know his policies, his record and his character and compare it to the alternative and then make a choice. Your vote isn't something to be earned - it's something you choose to give. 

If you choose not to vote, it's *your* choice. And all the consequences of choosing not to vote will forever be on your head. We're past the point of coddling ""undecided"" voters. Make a choice or get the hell out of the way. Because if you're not contributing, you're part of the problem."

14625,ik3lfa,"Biden has largely embraced the Green New Deal since he hit the campaign trail, almost point for point adopting the plan from 2019. Sanders and progressives pushed for more than that in the primary, but Biden's 2050 target was the original Green New Deal target. Then, Biden brought on people like Bernie Sanders to make changes on environmental policy.

Biden's platform, [Environmental Justice Plan](https://joebiden.com/environmental-justice-plan/) and [Build Back Better](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) go into a lot of the environmental projects and investments drawn from the Green New Deal.

[The Guardian](https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/20/joe-biden-has-endorsed-the-green-new-deal-in-all-but-name) talks about the multi-trillion dollar investments  into environmental infrastructure as well as policy recommendations Biden brought on from Sanders and Cortez and Jay Inslee.

[Slate](https://slate.com/business/2020/07/joe-bidens-climate-plan-is-the-green-new-deal-minus-the-crazy.amp) seems to do an interesting job describing Biden's rhetoric around the GND.

14626,ik3lfa,"https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/

>Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected."

14628,ik3lfa,"I think we have different understandings of Biden’s plan, so could you articulate where you are getting your information from instead of resorting to personal attacks based on assumptions about me?  My understanding is that, under the plan Biden proposes, anyone who wants to be a part of a government run plan can opt into it and it will cover them like medicare does. Those that prefer to be covered by private insurers (usually through their employers) will be allowed to remain on those plans. I freely admit that I am not an expert though, so if you want to educate me, here is your chance."

Trump already floated the idea of serving more than two terms, if he gets reelected he will completely stack the courts in his favor and we’re fucked when he refuses to step down. 

If we do not do everything in our power to get Trump out we seriously might not get another chance. We need to buy ourselves some time with someone who has a chance of winning and doesn’t pose an immediate existential threat to the future of this country. That’s Biden. Sorry. 

Fwiw I had my heart set on Bernie."
14631,ik3lfa,If you think they’re even close to equivalent you haven’t been paying attention. Trump is quite possibly the worst president in history with even the GOP starting to acknowledge it since pretty much every GOP former officeholder with any credibility is supporting Biden.

14633,ik3lfa,"Lol I’m glad you can’t vote because you must be blind if you think Trump is the lesser of two evils. Pretty much everything you listed in your original comment was false or projection. Trump can’t even speak in complete sentences and can barely remember 5 words in a row. He caused most of the conditions that are leading to violence and allowed 100s of thousands of Americans to die from COVID due to inaction and incompetence.

I actually am not sure how to respond to this. That is the literal point of voting. Forcing a vote for a candidate the voter does not like is how you get fascism. I don't know how to respond when we're having this much of a mismatch in communication.

14637,ik3lfa,"I forgot I had to consult you to see if my conclusions are valid, my bad.

I've already read his policies and done my own research, but thanks for sharing links.

&#x200B;

>Most people don't care about policy. When I was campaigning for Warren most average people didn't care when I mentioned specific policy, they liked her spirit and her image as a fighter. Some were interested in her plans but mostly just trusted her to be smart.

Policy matters a lot more for disadvantaged and marginalized groups. Human lives are at stake. Warren's base was primarily white. Not caring about policy is privilege.

Based on my experiences canvassing, phone banking, text banking,  GOTV, volunteering at campaign events, organizing watch parties, and being a campaign intern, I've concluded most people care about policy.

To give you an example of Biden not emphasizing policy, I went ahead and broke down his speech at the DNC convention. 740 out of 3,195 words were about policy. That's under 25%.

I tried to include my Google Doc here but my comment got removed because of the link, sorry.

Some people don't have a problem with that number and probably think Biden's doing ""enough"" on policy. ""Enough"" is a low standard for the big issues we're facing today. ""Enough"" will lead to more people dying. I won't be complicit in that.

&#x200B;

>Also if he doesn't do what you think he should then organize and hold feet to the fire.

14641,ik3lfa,“Crucial framework” is very snakey language. He has not endorsed the actual bill & that’s apparent from the specific goals set out in his climate plan.
14642,ik3lfa,"I don’t think that another term of trump would cause the ruin of America. Bernie was my first choice both these past elections, too. He seems like a pretty flawless person"
14643,ik3lfa,"Yeah, trump is terrible, probably up there with Jackson and Nixon. Biden, however, would get blown out of an election most other years. Saying Biden is leagues better than trump in no way means that he is worthy of the presidency. 

There’s a reason Biden hasn’t been talking. His team knows his best bet is to say as little as possible and let trump talk himself out of the election. I was pretty warm to him until I actually started paying attention to his interviews and speeches. I thought we were getting Obama era Biden, maybe he was always this way or maybe I didn’t see it because he wasn’t at the forefront like he is now

When’s the last time you thought “eh, doesn’t matter, I’ll just vote third party”. I’ll answer for you, never. And there will never be a day that you do, because you put so much urgency into each election. I know this election is important, so is every other one. Put a little faith in the legislative branches and in your local government. Trump is fanning the flames but he’s not the emperor"
14644,ik3lfa,"Maybe so.  I haven't found an answer yet, but why are these democratic mayors and governors allowing their cities to be destroyed by the mindless mobs?  I saw a video of that portland parade yesterday and that beautiful city looks like a third world country with the graffiti everywhere.  Why do they allow the destruction to continue?"
14645,ik3lfa,"Do you find it impossible to believe that centered people are absolutely pissed off at the riots going on in democratic run cities/states?  As for not speaking in complete sentences, Trump is better than Biden!  How bad is that!"
14646,ik3lfa,"Where to start.

>If neither is entitled to my vote, they inherently have to earn it over their opposition.

Those are the only two options for giving your vote? What about basic self-interest? What about for your children or grandkids? Of course there's other options than just earning it or being entitled to it.

>Forcing a vote for a candidate the voter does not like is how you get fascism. 

No, withholding a vote out of spite, or pique, or because you didn't like your choices are how we *actually* got a fascist. Trump's voters didn't make those calculations and came out while democrats and independents literally said Hillary was just as bad as Trump, and stayed home. We got Trump because Democrats who didn't feel she earned their votes chose to be petty and not vote.

>you're actually just as bad as a Trump supporter

Trump supporters insult and attack. I didn't, you did. So right back at ya.

>you just think you have the moral high ground because ""at least my side doesn't say the quiet parts out loud!""

I never claimed or implied I had any high ground. Again, that's you projecting. This idealistic idea that until you get someone that fits your perfect policy match, you're not going to vote is nothing *but* self-righteousness. 

The real world is that you have two choices. It sucks, it's not fair and we must have better. But those are your choices. You act like those of us saying that, are telling you to shut up about your disagreements and be a good little democrat and vote. That's not what's happening. But it *is*  true you only have two choices. Because if you're holding on to this idea you can sit it out till you get someone better next election, you need to wake up to the reality that if you allow Trump to get re-elected, it's unlikely you'll ever get another real election."

14649,ik3lfa,"Just wanted to clarify: Warren's base cared about policy probably the most in the primary. She's literally the ""I have a plan for that"" candidate. But when I talked to average people who didn't pay attention to politics they were less interested in her plans than her personality and how she conducted herself. If we were in an ideal world policy would be the only thing that matters, but it isn't. People very much care about the politician as a person too. I think Biden is specifically going after people who don't care about specific policy goals and he shapes his rhetoric to reflect that. Because the Warren and Sanders people who care about policy can see clear as day that Biden is better than Trump by a country mile."
14650,ik3lfa,"On that I'm in complete agreement. And I apologize for mistaking what you said for not voting. Unfortunately that seems to be a common decision for many with similar views, but you didn't and I assumed, so I'm sorry.

14654,ik3lfa,"If our country was descending into despotism this is exactly what it would look like. We can ignore all the red flags and hope deep down Trump isn’t *that* bad despite all indications being to the contrary or we take the lessons we learned from history serious and do everything in our power to get him out of office.

You should check out *It Can’t Happen Here* by Sinclair Lewis and [Despotism](https://www.britannica.com/video/213840/Encyclopaedia-Britannica-Films-Despotism-1946) a 1946 film from the Encyclopedia Brittanica."
14655,ik3lfa,I live in Portland and it looks the same what the fuck are you on about? You have zero idea what you’re talking about. These are all just Trump talking points. People are allowed to peacefully assemble it’s the police that turn peaceful protesters into mobs by attacking them. What would you propose be done? Unmarked police officers grabbing people off the streets and arresting them? Oh wait trump already tried that and failed. Stronger police presence? Oh wait they also tried that and pissed people off even more by abusing and brutalizing them. Since you got it all figured out how should the mayors of these democratic cities take care of this? More fascism you say?! Oh wow how could that possibly backfire for the 100th time in a row?
14656,ik3lfa,Dude no he’s not. How fucking stupid can you be?
14657,ik3lfa,Ooops. Glad you like 'em though. :D
14658,ik3lfa,"Appreciate that, thank you."
14659,ik3lfa,Sure thing. Spread these around to everyone and everywhere. It seems the media ignores most of this. People need to know what Joe stands for. :D
14660,ik3lfa,"I would throw every one of the criminal rioters and property destroyers in prison.  If there is none of that going on in Portland, then no one goes to jail. 

It's not fascism, it's upholding the law and protecting the citizens of the city.  That word (fascism) has lost all meaning and importance, just like racism.  Call me either, call me both.   They have zero meaning because they've been so overused and misused.

But if you're happy with what's going on in your city,  I hope it continues indefinitely in your neighborhood and follows you through your entire life."
14661,ik3lfa,"The biggest issue by far is Covid and after that comes ""the economy"" which everyone but Trump understands is fucked until Covid-19 is stopped. 

""Crime"" is a top issue for just 4% and I think we know how that 4% is voting already."
14662,ik3lfa,Biden is not incoherent in his speech?
14663,ik3lfa,"Also, you might want to think about updating them too. For instance, I know the $1.3 Trillion investment in environmental infrastructure was boosted up to $2 Trillion."
14664,ik3lfa,"I will, I've got your comment saved for later!"
14665,j65zsg,"I asked my coworker about this because he kept saying the media and doctors gave up on it too early and it should be used.  I told him the President didn’t use it and he used an experimental antibody cocktail, remdesivir and some steroids.

14666,j65zsg,Wasn’t he taking hydroxychloroquine prophylactically? Lot of good that did for him.

14748,j65zsg,"The bbc can’t be the source. News spreads information; it doesn’t create it (or it’s not supposed to). 

If the doctors are live-streaming, cool. Would’ve loved to see that link."
14749,j65zsg,Sure they can. At this point you’re just looking for anything you can find to argue against the idea that your dear leader isn’t actually taking the drug he touted for months.

14772,hoy3k0,Strong statement from the future Vice President of the United States
14773,hoy3k0,"Here’s all you need to know about Republicans and the Military. 

They wrap themselves in the military shamelessly. The RNC for George W Bush was non stop jingoistic glorifying of the troops and military. 

4 years later at the RNC for Romney, after the disastrous Republican war on Iraq is proving to be an utter catastrophe, not one peep about the military, not ONE mention of the war  only on the third day day after being called out by the media did they hustle out some prop soldiers. 

Republicans give zero fucks about the military beyond patting themselves on the back for saying  “thank you for your service” and putting a “support our troops” magnet on their foreign car. John McCain voted AGAINST the second GI Bill. Against it. 

Republicans dont give a damn about the soldiers, they only care about expensive weapons systems and keeping the filthy lucre from the war effort in their districts. 

Fake patriots."
14774,hoy3k0,I love her as VP pick. But the cynic in me can't help all this press is a floater to finalize her as the pick. I can only hope she's also a Bears fan.

Vice President Duckworth sounds great, President Duckworth sounds great."
14784,hoy3k0,r/shitpost
14785,hoy3k0,"Why though? Like yes, she a wounded female veteran. But why her? Being a veteran doesn't mean you going to be a good leader or a good person. There's a bunch of active progressive female politicians that could fill the roll. Tammy comes from a historical red district. She is at best a blue dog democratic with no notable political accomplishments. Nobody knew about her until like a couple of days ago."
14786,hoy3k0,Why do dems think participating in a crime against humanity is a good qualification for office? Barf.
14787,hoy3k0,Sorry but being in the military and having no legs doesn't make you more qualified to be vice president. She's playing the military in the handicap card. Something awful.

14789,hoy3k0,Seems a little too patriotic and American for the Democratic Party today...

14791,hoy3k0,This is America 🙄
14792,hoy3k0,"Stars & Stripes, PLUS the other is Army Camo."
14793,hoy3k0,You're spot on. I think they are most worried about her getting the VP nod since she could fracture some of the military vote.
14794,hoy3k0,"

Duckworth's life story makes her uniquely compelling to the American imagination, combining both the American migrant story, as well as a lineage that goes back to the Daughters of the Revolution.  Veteran who risked her life and gave her legs for her country.  But she didn't let that be the end of her story, she went on to be a US Senator, and god will, the first Female VP of the Unite States.  

She seems to have the political chops too, granted she hasn't been tested hard yet.  But if she shines as VP, the Republicans are damn scared that with her help, the Dems will hold the WH for two terms after Biden.  

TL;DR - I think they're less afraid about her giving the Biden campaign an umph, and much more afraid of a future Duckworth campaign."
14795,hoy3k0,"I keep seeing articles about her, so I think that might be what happens.  We'll see.  She makes more strategic sense than anyone.  Don't know enough about her policy positions to get too excited, but I'd vote for a rock before voting R or not voting.  So it really doesn't matter.  Veep has basically no power anyway unless the President wants them to."
14796,hoy3k0,Please let it be her!
14797,hoy3k0,I don’t think she can be as she isn’t a natural born citizen. She was born in Thailand right?
14798,hoy3k0,Why else do you think she would be getting all this publicity?..
14799,hoy3k0,Biden & Duckworth would go a long way to restoring international relationships and putting the US back in a leadership role on the world stage.
14800,hoy3k0,you misspelled fascists twice
14801,hoy3k0,"To be honest the primary candidate the ""people in charge"" wanted and cheated and shafted the candidate the people wanted in favor of would not really restore much integrity.

14802,hoy3k0,"I remember the Illinois Senate debates from a couple years ago when she mentioned her military pedigree. Sen. Mark Kirk's snide remark about her family going from Thailand to fight for Washington arguably cost him the election. A cringe moment for sure.

EDIT: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rDdCQqp_oY) for reference."
14803,hoy3k0,Thanks for posting. I liked reading this as it’s such a punch to those opposing her patriotism.
14804,hoy3k0,"Another wrinkle in Duckworths story is that she specifically joined the only division in the military (at the time) that would allow for a woman to be sent into direct contact. 

Yet somehow she's the America hating coward?"

14838,hoy3k0,"There are plenty of great VP candidates. Yes, Duckworth's visibility is high right now, and I *am* a fan, there's a lot of factors that go into selecting a VP.

14839,hoy3k0,Especially if he picks Kamala Harris.
14840,hoy3k0,Because Warren is a terrible pick? Because we done that a dozen great candidates? Biden needs to care about two qualities: who would make the best president and who would work best with him.

14852,hoy3k0,"That's a good point.  They will have an advantage for sure, but Biden is so vanilla that I sort of doubt his VP will be a total shoo in.  Probably depends on whether left-wing independents continue to get involved in our primary and have a single, clear choice (Warren?).  Also if Republicans/right leaning independents get back involved in their own primary.

We picked up a ton more moderates this election cycle in a lot of places, I think.  Progressives were also split, at least somewhat.  I don't think Biden would have happened if moderates hadn't pulled the Republican tactic of falling in line to kill off a challenge from the left.  That was right out of the Republican playbook.

Don't intend any of that as criticism, just pointing out that Trump made it a weird primary season for us."

14860,hoy3k0,"Secretary of the Treasury, considering her prominent financial positions?"
14861,hoy3k0,"She has fought hard for veteran's benefits and rights.

She also came up with ""Cadet Bone Spurs""."
14862,hoy3k0,I can’t think of anything.
14863,hoy3k0,"The Iraq war was strategically a stupid war to fight, but serving in the war was still honorable, and was still fighting enemies who deserved to be fought. The problem with the war was that it was not worth the danger it caused to soldiers like her, which makes her bravery and sacrafice all the more important."
14864,hoy3k0,Oh it's there. For your own logic their thinking is that this report is all luggenpresse and that Trump was fine to do nothing because if the NYT reported it there's no way it's real!
14865,hoy3k0,"""Biden is so vanilla that I sort of doubt his VP will be a total shoo in""

I think you are looking at this the wrong way. ""Biden is so vanilla"" his VP can and likely WILL stand out, I can only imagine the VP will be the face of the Biden Presidency due to youthfulness, passion, and energy. Obama himself thinks the Presidency is a young man's game and has shown some doubt in Bidens ability to handle the office. I would expect a very front and center VP

""They will have an advantage for sure"" - Yes

left-wing independents continue to get involved in our primary and have a single, clear choice (Warren?) - dude real Progressives (independents especially) HATE Warren. Warren was supported by Dems that like to play progressive but when the chips are on the table they will vote blue no matter who"
14866,hoy3k0,I like to think that Susan Rice would be a nice alternative to Harris who fits a similar bill
14867,hoy3k0,"Spoiler: he’s picking Harris.

At least if the organised polishing of her Wikipedia page is any indication (same thing was done for previous VP picks prior to their announcement for both Ds and Rs since at least Sarah Palin)."
14868,hoy3k0,Good call
14869,hoy3k0,You realize that avoid the draft Vietnam was probably the only good thing Trump has done? Like he a horrible piece of shit. But avoiding fighting in an unpopular and unjust war isn't a bad thing.
14870,hoy3k0,Which enemies were those?
14871,hoy3k0,"As a Warren supporter I can't disagree with you more about her.  Bernie bros hate her, but they aren't real Democrats anyway, and tend to be independents he brought in specifically because he's not actually a Democrat.  Thus my point about left wing independents getting involved in our primary.  I don't know that they will really keep wanting to be involved, which is fine by me, to be honest."
14872,hoy3k0,[deleted]
14873,hoy3k0,Susan Rice would be fine by me.
14874,hoy3k0,Buying your way out of it and then scorning those like McCain and Duckworth is not a bad thing. It's a horrible thing.
14875,hoy3k0,"I never tried to indicate avoiding the draft was a bad thing. But after not serving, he has absolutely no place attempting to degrade POWs or wounded veterans, or speaking disrespectfully of Gold Star families."
14876,hoy3k0,That is not why he did it.
14877,hoy3k0,Iraqi insurgent terrorists.
14878,hoy3k0,"what

edit: that’s actually very clever"
14879,hoy3k0,"In the past 60 year, tell me what what conflict was the US involved in that were just? If you want to talk about John McCain, the guy literal dropped bombs of random villages. He probably killed hundreds of Vietnamese  civilians during his tour bombing north Vietnam and was unrepentant. Both awful people."
14880,hoy3k0,Was that the reason for the invasion?
14881,hoy3k0,But her emails
14882,hoy3k0,"No, but that’s who she was fighting."
14883,hoy3k0,"But at that point were we not just fighting enemies we’ve created? When does it stop being admirable is what I wonder. The answer could very well be never and that it’s always admirable, but I do think about it."
14884,hoy3k0,"They were always there, they just hadn’t been fighting yet."

If you really, honestly believe the GOP is lessening governmental power and increasing individual freedom, I've got this great bridge out in San Francisco I'd like to sell you."
14966,9rvuet,"Ahhhhh delusions. How did you stumble in here? Republicans don’t actually care about giving people more individual freedoms, it’s just “on their ticket” despite increasing the federal deficits over and over, and democrats care about giving government oversight to welfare-based programs which help out individuals. Democrats care not about control. Democratic attack ads don’t fear monger - which republicans commonly do. Fear mongering is control "
14967,9rvuet,"> Democrats are for more government power and control and republicans are  for more individual freedoms and smaller government with less power.  

They are for individual freedoms ? Really ? It's the litteral core of liberalism, not conservatism. But yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure GOP voted unequivocally ""Ay"" for the Civil Right Acts in 1964, or for any issues concerning LGBT(Q+) and minorities. "

The Liberal side actually endorses things like free speech and doesn't suggest we lock up journalists (or condone their murder) because they disagree.  If you actually believed in making America great again, you'd support the side that created the changes that shaped the country into what it was. Instead, you made the decision that empowering someone who sides with Nazis was somehow a good decision.

If I am given the choice between taking in an immigrant who believes in the actual ideals that created America in exchange for someone supporting the rebirth of Nazi ideologies,  I'll ask if we can make it a 2 for 1. "

He walks over and stands above his father, tears streaming,  ""ALL I EVER WANTED WAS YOUR LOVE AND APPROVAL"", he screams at his gasping father.  

Cut back to Meuller, peeling off his fine pressed and now bullet punctured crisp white button up. To reveal a bullet-proof vest. He clutches at the impact site of the bullet, and looks at Don Jr, eyes wide. ""NO JR DON'T DO IT! THIS ISN'T OUR DEAL! YOU'RE BETTER THAN HIM""

quick cut back to DJTJr, hands shaking clasped together on the gun, pointing at the head of the now wheezing President.  

O fortuna reaching a crescendo 

""YOU NEVER LOVED ME""

*wheezing* 

""What is there to *long gasp* love? (Speaking softer now) You could never really *wet raspy gasp* be me.""

Cut back to Mueller 

""NOOOOOOOOO!""

We must never forget that (nor deny it, as it is a ""Duty of Memory"").

I did not know it had such an approval within the GOP at the time. So I would like to retract my statement about Civil Right Acts, but I think that my point is still valid concerning minorities rights nowadays : immigration has become a central subject in republicans, and most of them campaign is not based on individual rights...

15073,9rvuet,I just hate how everything gets turned into a race issue. Does nothing but divide. 
15074,9rvuet,"There's only no proof of it if you are unwilling to trust your own government, dad.

I'll keep winning, you keep being mad, and I'll be a lot happier than you are when President Trump gets re-elected, k?"
15075,9rvuet,"It is. Currently, you have thousands that are coming at the same time. None are vetted and we have no idea who they are and only what their stated intentions are. Also, they are coming across the border with no means of support when they get here which means taxpayers are paying the bill. Again.  

So if you feel so strongly, give them your address and sponsor several of them in your home.  No need to find out who they are, right?

You're logic about Trumpies being more dangerous is illogical. "

15186,iyljfq,"No dude just no. Trump has many many times said incredibly racist things about Hispanics, black and Asians. You don’t think Kung-Flu is racist? You don’t think saying that all the people except for a small few that come from Mexico are rapists and murderers is racist? The way he treated Puerto Rico after they were hit by a hurricane? Calling other countries shit hole countries when he knows nothing about them isn’t racist? Fuck off. Get your head out of trumps ass for a second and take a breath. Maybe then you’ll see how very stupid you are."
15187,iyljfq,You should consider listening to this and not just responding in an edgy way. A lot of women (including me) really dislike seeing the word pussy used as a derogatory term.

15190,iyljfq,"I'm an outlier, I see trump as a positive, in that it has really woken up a lot of people, and it has also empowered progressives more to take hold in the party...sometimes disaster brings changes. 

In  1913 there was a huge flood in Dayton, OH. People from the area donated millions of dollars, like 2 billion dollars in today's money. They built levies, etc...and haven't had a flood since. 

The point being, they could've had a bigger flood and more loss of  life if they did nothing, or if the flood didn't happen then, but maybe a few years later only bigger... So having that disaster propelled them to fix things. This disaster I hope has shown us many flaws in our system that needs fixed, and hopefully we can shore up our democracy, or we'll just get another Trump only that one will be smarter and get everything he desires."
15191,iyljfq,"I respect that fact. I would suggest that if you are uncomfortable with the word when it is used that way that you don't use the word that way.  Myself, I am still OK with it.  I also call people dicks on occasion."

Conservatives have spent the last 6 months politicizing EVERYTHING about the pandemic including refusing to do the absolute least they could (wear a mask). This is fucking gaslighting 101."
15193,iyljfq,No way it’s schools reopening because the orange idiot forced them too right? No way it’s the fact that we shut down for only a few weeks and then called it quits just when cases were starting to surge nation wide. Trump himself is on tape saying this is a huge deal behind the scenes and then lying to the American people and down playing it. Sure the riots might have contributed but you honestly think that’s it? What a stupid fuck you are.
15194,iyljfq,That’s kind of like using the n-bomb and saying you’re ok with it. You’re using a word associated with female genitalia as a word to call people cowards. It’s misogynistic even if you don’t intend it that way. I’ve stopped calling people dicks for the same reason.

Impeachment won't fix it. Indictment won't fix it. The only thing that will help the US move on from this nightmare is an absolute drubbing at the polls both this coming November and the following 4-5 elections. There has to be a strong message sent to the GOP that this sort of garbage will cost them their power."

It looks like we only scratched the surface."
15208,8cqke5,At first when this story broke I didn’t understand why it was such a big deal but now it’s super apparent what the issue is. Hannity has always been an absolute monster and the way he behaves should be appalling to anyone who calls themselves a journalist. If the investigation goes into Hannity’s life there are going to be a litany of pure evil that Fox and Cohen have buried deep.

Isn't it also interesting how Hannity has been so persistent in his attacks on Mueller? I wouldn't be surprised if Trump and Hannity are working to undermine Mueller's investigation in the media and Cohen has acted as the point of contact."

15221,8cqke5,"I'm starting to think that my lifelong definition of what constitutes a ""douchebag"" is really just a fascist"
15222,8cqke5,Here's a theory: Michael Cohen was providing Hannity access to classified materials so they can draft narrative or provide guidance. Not sure if Cohen has access to classified info but it wouldn't be surprising if Trump communicated through Cohen providing classified info. This is a long shot though. It's more likely that Cohen paid some woman or women off for him.
15223,8cqke5,"Yo, this is super spicy. But I’m gonna need more than an image macro as a sauce. Can you hook us up OP? "

15226,8cqke5,Lawyers
15227,8cqke5,"Maybe I'm naive, but what's the big deal? This is Sean Hannity we're talking about here. Were we really supposed to expect him to cover the Michael Cohen story correctly? Of course not, Hannity has been caping for Trump since day 1, this doesn't make any difference."

15231,8cqke5,"Is there a law that says a reporter has to disclose that a news story is about their own lawyer? I'm fairly sure the answer is no but I'm interested to hear what the outrage is about exactly. 

That said OP, is there a reason why you don't disclose that you use multiple accounts in a single thread to fake interest and build karma? Seems like something you'd scream to the high heavens about if it were a CONservative so I'm just curious why you don't disclose the same.

Also, I can't help but continue to wonder how you have 17+ hours a day everyday to post on reddit. That is absolutely bonkers to me. 

Why don't you spend that time to get out and actually try to work for the changes you want to see instead of crying here and hoping someone else will do the work for you? Children spent their spring break marching for change and yet all you've done was screech into the void that is social media for the last 7 years. 7 years straight of 15+ hour days....do you have any idea what you could've accomplished with that time? I feel so bad for you just thinking about it."

Hannity isn't actually his client. Its a trick play to distract and pave the way for pardons/firing of Mueller. They lied and said Hannity was the ""third client"" in order to give Hannity a huge microphone to spread propaganda/fake news and discredit the investigation in the minds of Americans. Then any charges that come out of the ""fake investigation"" can be pardoned by Trump. 

Watch hannity's ratings go through the roof now. I bet his radio show at 3 just saw a drastic increase in listeners. People will be tuning into his show. They are playing the media like a fiddle. 

Hopefully the courts can sort all this out though with due process and objective evidence. "

15291,8cqke5,"100% the Racist agenda of the Republicans couldn’t be more apparent. 

We didn’t have any outright old fashioned lynchings. So it’s still lost on many of the moderate Middle American base. To summarize MLK from an Alabama jail cell, the moderate comfortable middle Americans who may not be racist, but tolerate their racist family and neighbors will do the most damage to the American republic. 

Until we are able to acknowledge the problem and the dispiriting status quote we probably won’t be able to move past this Rightwing tilt. 

The hardest part about a shift to the left is overcoming the racial prejudices, as minorities in America will feel overlooked. 

The quickest way to identify a left leaning liberal will be how they only talk about people based on their economic status rather than their ethnic status. 

Poor blacks & Poor whites & poor browns & poor yellows all have one thing in common, the wealthiest Americans despise and hold contempt for them all."

It would be political suicide for the next president to pardon him, but again, that would just be a federal pardon.

15397,62sa3w,"We should distinguish here between Republican voters (who in my experience are indeed mostly nice and charitable and etc.--hell, my whole family consists of this brand of ""good"" Republicans) and Republican politicians. It's getting harder and harder to make the case that Republican politicians are interested in much more than revising the tax code in ways that benefit the already wealthy and gutting  regulations, no matter how sensible, if they get in the way of corporate interests. 

This notion that Democrats believe others are ""entitled to what you worked for"" is just a nice digestible soundbite that allows conservative media to quickly dismiss progressive ideas (look, socialism, scary!). Another name for ""entitlements"" is of course ""the social safety net,"" and it benefits us all.

For example, once upon a time I was on Medicaid. I ended up with a brain tumor. Medicaid (tax payers) paid to have the tumor zapped with radiation. About $70,000, if I remember right. If I had not been on Medicaid, I probably could have asked my family for the money. They could have probably come up with it, though it would have set them back years financially. They would have had to mortgage their house. My family, btw, is very opposed to entitlements (""people taking what they have worked for""). Was I ""entitled"" to such a benefit? I don't know. But I do know that I am alive and working and paying taxes and contributing to society today because of it. And my thoroughly Republican parents were utterly saved, financially, because of it. 

(I should note too: the alternative to me receiving treatment under Medicare would have been waiting until the brain tumor sent me to the E.R. with life threatening symptoms, at which point I would have received emergency surgery to remove the tumor and (hopefully) save my life, but at a much higher cost. I would not have been remotely able to pay those medical bills. In that scenario it is the hospital and/or taxpayers (still) taking it on the chin. "
15398,62sa3w,"You know what? I would actually be glad if some of the money I earned went to pay for a kid's broken leg, or someone's stroke medication, or a kidney transplant. Because that's what societies are supposed to do. "

15400,62sa3w,"> At that point it's an ethical question, are less fortunate people entitled to what you worked for? 

This is an interesting subject that goes to the heart of a lot of contentious ideological issues in our politics of the last half century and more. It comes down to a fundamental concept of government and the social contract. The conservative perspective is that government should not try to interfere with the outcomes provided to society by our collective economic activity. That capitalism with minimal restraints will work towards increased prosperity through competition and increasing efficiency. Progressives believe that capitalism left to its own devices will concentrate the fruits of production in the hands of too few individuals, and that the government has the role of ensuring that a minimal amount of the prosperity generated by capitalism is shared with the public in the form of financial security entitlements, infrastructure, education, health care, labor rights, and civil rights. I think there's room for both, and our system works best when everybody comes together to work on compromises that advance everyone's interests in good faith. Unfortunately, we no longer have that, and I place the blame directly at the feet of the Republican Party and the extemist ideological media allies. They have become an obstructionist party that rejects collective governance through negotiation and compromise, and our democratic republic cannot function if it is held hostage in this way."

If we want any chance of removing Trump from office before his first term is up, taking back the legislature in 2018 should be the Democrats' top priority. "
15436,62sa3w,"Obviously Republicans aren't at the same level that Jackson was towards the Natives, but it doesn't have any actual bearing to today. Our country is completely different today than it was there. Saying such-and-such thing was worse does nothing other than undermine legitimate criticism. "
15437,62sa3w,">Giving your money directly to the person that needs it is as efficient as it gets.

It's really not. Having an organizing body that finds cases that need the help and disburses that money is significantly more efficient than having individual good actors attempt to do it on their own. That's why we have governments in the first place and why we have nonprofits. "
15438,62sa3w,"Directly giving someone money is the most efficient way to give someone money, it's not the most efficient way to provide them with healthcare."
15439,62sa3w,You don't earn every penny of your salary. Some of that money is earned by society at large. Because it helped you arrive where you are. Same goes for capital returns. So we have taxes.
15440,62sa3w,[removed]
15441,62sa3w,"The same argument can be used to those that want more military spending or a wall on our southern border.  There is no requirement in the constitution for these things.  In fact, with regard to the military, this country was founded on the basis of not having a standing army at all, because they were wise enough to realize if a country has a standing army, they will use it.  Military spending and the like are simply issues a large enough group of people think is a good idea to spend money on and they voted for it to happen.  To make it happen, they will spend other people's money.
     
The libertarian argument is that any use of other people's money by the government is morally wrong, and that all spending should be voluntary.  Besides the arguments against that already linked below, there's another way of viewing this issue: you want some things that others don't, and they want some things that you don't.  When you pay your taxes, those taxes go only to the things you want.  Nothing else.  Whereas their taxes go only to the things they want, and nothing else.  This means that for those that want more military spending, their taxes go only to the military, whereas those that want more healthcare, their taxes go only towards healthcare.
     
This makes the military more expensive for you than it would be if other people were forced to help pay for it, but at least you're not paying for health care (which is absurd in truth, since you will receive healthcare when you are eligible for Medicare, or if you become disabled, even if you pretend you don't pay for it).
     
It should be noted, however, that our problem with healthcare in this country is not too much or not enough government or taxes, it's that the health care market is extracting monopoly prices with the help of government.  [Our government spends more on health care than any other country in the world](http://www.pnhp.org/news/2016/january/government-funds-nearly-two-thirds-of-us-health-care-costs-american-journal-of-pub), and we still don't cover tens of millions of Americans.  We spend more, even if we count only government spending, than France, not just per capita but as a percentage of GDP, and in France they send out a phlebotomist to your house to draw blood, doctors do house calls when you're sick, and the system includes full dental, including braces.
     
We could have that system, and not spend a penny more in taxes.  We could have that system and even reduce the deficit, while freeing up billions spent today on healthcare premiums that would instantly be unnecessary.  But we don't, because Republicans exist, and while they exist to represent a valid conservative political view, they've been corrupted to instead carry water for a small group of incredibly wealthy sociopaths that want to recreate feudalism, impoverish the middle class and then punish them for being poor.
     
Before you say the reason we spend so much on healthcare is too much government, we are the only OECD country that doesn't have universal, government controlled healthcare.  By any reasonable objective measure we have less government interference in the healthcare ""market"" than any other country - and yet we spend the most.  We aren't less healthy than Britain, and they spend less than half what we do for better results.  We spend more because our government isn't strong enough or capable enough to bargain effectively on our behalf, and individually we lack power to do it ourselves.
     
We certainly have lots of government, the problem is, it's working only for the wealthy special interests, and it's doing so because of people like you that advocate for less.  All that accomplishes is less government that benefits you and others like you, freeing up resources for corruption and crony capitalism.  The elites will *never* reduce their corrupt practices because you vote for smaller government.  You're deluding yourself by thinking they will.  There's no excuse for thinking it after the Bush administration.

15596,5p3r24,"Really?  Then how come no other country anywhere near our size has tried the Canadian model?  Tell me Professor, how does it work?  "
15597,5p3r24,"I like how pre-existing conditions are always an old people thing. Because it's not like people are born with disorders, right? And because it's not like people get kicked off mid-year because of a job loss even though they got the insurance before they were sick, right? 

"
15598,5p3r24,"I'm really sorry to hear that. The insurance business is a gamble, just like all other types of insurance. Companies promise to take care of your health care bills as long as you pay them while you are healthy, most people will end up paying more money than the coverage they require. It would otherwise be an unprofitable business. 

The ACA mandated the following:

>Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies can’t refuse to cover you or charge you more just because you have a “pre-existing condition” — that is, a health problem you had before the date that new health coverage starts. They also can’t charge women more than men.

This is the government removing the gamble from the insurance business. It would be no different than if the government said all car insurers would have to accept people even though their car has already been stolen. The burden would lie on other people who pay their car insurance. No one would get insurance until their car has already been stolen. 

The same applies to the health insurance business, although as humans we see this as a touchier subject because human lives are infinitely more valuable than cars. This type of government interference just drives the prices up for everyone. I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to afford health care, I'm just saying the current system is a complete failure and there are many alternatives which would work much better for everyone. Although not perfect, look at Romneycare and what it has done for Massachusetts. 
http://obamacarefacts.com/romneycare-romneyhealthcare/

There are hundredths of alternative solutions to this issue and I'm not saying any one of them is perfect. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFoXyFmmGBQ&t=194s"
15599,5p3r24,In my view their bias makes them reckless.  Yet they brand their recklessness as conservatism.   And people buy it given that the republicans now control government at nearly every level of America.  We'll have to see if Trump is an objective realist like Paul Ryan.  I don't think Trump is an Ayn Rand disciple like the majority of the Republican Party has become.  I think Trump will do whatever he thinks will help his family businesses.  That could be good and/or bad.  Trump's inaugural speech made promises to do things I doubt the Republican Party will go for or support.

Would that be ok? I know fire moves terrifyingly fast under those winds (not sure if the Camp fire had Santa Ana wind conditions). But if they were setting up evacuees there, perhaps it was safer. 

Seems to me that it might be nice for the soldiers to be greeted by grateful (though traumatized) survivors who see them as helpful rather than seen as threatening and terrifying.

There are actual laws in place to prevent a president from deploying the military inside the US as a police force, and those laws exist for a good goddamned reason.

15880,cm145b,"in california. if you have a non assault weapon, and add either a removable magazine(without tool) or a but stock, its now an assaualt weapon. Same gun. same rounds of ammo, same sized ammo. But one is ""more lethal"" because idk. 

Also, more people are killed everyday by pistols than long guns. More people commit suicide, than people die to mass shootings (60x more). 

""assault weapons"" aren't an actual problem, they're just a problem the media likes to show a lot."

15882,cm145b,You are completely incorrect. Where do you freaks come from? It just takes 10 seconds of searching to show you are totally wrong.
15883,cm145b,"The production and sale of automatic weapons have been illegal in the US since well before 1994. Also, ""assault"" is a verb, not an adjective.

If you want to ban guns then argue for that, don't play bullshit games trying to sort them into ""good"" and ""bad guns, especially based on stupid criteria like ""bayonet mounts"" and pistol grips."
15884,cm145b,"I prefer people to not roll into places like their doing a cordon and search with the same sort of weapons I used in Afghanistan sans burst, which is hardly ever used in combat because it tends to be a bit finicky. ALso upvoted for the only legit response I've seen to my post so far."
15885,cm145b,Doesn't help the fact that most Right leaning people are religious and often mix Right wing politics with bible teachings to further cement their beliefs.
15886,cm145b,"What bullshit, the illegal guns come from the legal *american* market.

Guns are smuggled out of the US, not into it."
15887,cm145b,"Not just that, but they don’t even have to be the type of pyschotic person shooting strangers we always associate it with. In fact, the majority of cases classified “mass shootings” are violence within families

Edit: Found the article if you’re interested. Good read. https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/who-are-mass-shooters-mass-shooter-demographics-part-2/"
15888,cm145b,"Except that the parallels are minimal at best. Firstly, gun rights were broadly widened under the Nazi regime. The regime chose to attack Jews in particular. But the idea that it was gun laws that led the Jews to death is insane. 

Entire fucking trained militaries in Europe weren’t able to withstand Nazi power until midway through the war. Would some pistols and rifles really have kept Jews safe amid that regime? The Nazis were armed and relentless. Plus, it was a regime that had little concern with rights, period. 

https://forward.com/scribe/401885/would-guns-have-saved-jews-from-the-holocaust/

Plenty of Jews remained armed. It did little good. The history tells us that the industrial might of the Nazi regime was little-fazed by those who shot back. It’s almost as if industrial-military complexes wield violence more effectively than citizens with hunting rifles. 

It’s insulting to argue that had Jews only been armed with small arms then the Holocaust wouldn’t have happened. Bullshit. The Shoah was not the consequence of gun laws. It was the consequence of a murderous regime."
15889,cm145b,"It also refers to semi automatics and I’m sure some other things too but you choose to focus on the aspect that bolsters you.

Your argument is bad. Yes more people die from handguns. There’s more handguns around. I’m sure more people die from handguns than rocket artillery and builders weapons in the US that’s not a good reason to allow the public access to either. Let’s say everyone with a handgun had a semi auto in sure you’d see more deaths but thankfully they’re harder to get a hold of. Or are you suggesting we should ban pistols? 

Your suicide argument. So what? Does the number of suicides reduce the number of mass shooting victims? No? Then how is that at all relevant."
15890,cm145b,"Nope, they're just expensive. Of course they've only been used in crimes twice since the 1930s, both times by cops.

Another fact the gun nuts ignore."
15891,cm145b,People are still finding massive caches of armaments in former states of the USSR. And some of their weapon factories still operate. They come down the Alaskan arms pipeline and into south america and typically 1 or 2 are swiped as payment by smugglers. My point is that even if fire arms were illegal in the US there are still people making 7.62 rounds in eastern europe and dumping them on the black market and it is fairly trivial to make something that shoots them.
15892,cm145b,When you say semi automatics are you just talking about semi automatic rifles or all semi automatic guns?  I’m asking because a large majority of pistols are semi automatic as well.
15893,cm145b,"there's a miscommunication between us because your first sentence doesn't seem to make sense with regards to mine. (i dont understand what ""it"" is that refers to semi's and what the ""aspects"" are that bolster me)

What i'm trying to say in the first section of my post is that these laws that get passed are done by people ignorant of guns, and in ways that do nothing useful other than punish law abiding citizens. 

for example: Why does adding a butt stock make the same gun dangerous now? because an ignorant politician views it as ""more dangerous"" without any logical reason, same with suppressors, same with flash breaks, same with forward pistol grips etc. Now, because of their ignorance they push a law that not only doesn't achieve much, it also punishes law abiding citizens by taking away their rights, and making it more likely they become criminals. This has now accomplished nothing solid in terms of safety, while pissing off gun rights supporters, making them less likely to compromise.(since we have been getting our rights taken away that have accomplished nothing, and newer ""compromises"" don't include us getting anything at all)

I wasn't clear with the 2nd half of my comment, but what i was trying to say is, Mass shootings are blown completely out of proportion and this is evident when we look at how much news time is taken up by mass shootings vs actual problems like suicides. Even worse, people feel like removing rights(banning guns) is the best way to deal with these problems, when our actual problems include our lack of good healthcare, shitty prison system, a shitty wealth inequality, and media that is highly encouraged to glorify mass shootings. 

If americans deal with the problems i listed, we'll actually bring down our suicide and murder rate better than these good-willed but ineffective and impossible guns laws."
15894,cm145b,[deleted]
15895,cm145b,"You may have some validity in your first argument but not your second. Acts of terrorism are never blown out of proportion. This is not a problem other western democracies face at anywhere close to the same level. Why is that? It’s not hard to see. It’s because in our country it’s much easier to get your hands on guns. It really is that simple. 

Your whataboutism is meaningless. You can walk and chew gum at the same time. You’re just trying to distract from a horrific and deadly issue by saying ‘what about suicide?’ The reason your point wasn’t clear and still isn’t is because it’s hard to get clarity out of a shit argument. 

You don’t need a gun, you don’t need to fix wealth inequality to address gun violence the media are not going to just not report on a mass shooting because y’know, it’s news.

As for your first point. Who cares? You don’t need a butt stock you sure as shit don’t need a suppressor. Should the definition be more clear? Sure, but I’m not shedding a tear for your gun accessories."
15896,cm145b,I don't think you understand what I'm trying to say. Because you can buy guns on the black market and the black market is not centralized saying well you just can't buy or own this anymore has never worked for anything ever. Prohibition and the war on drugs come to mind. And if they don't use rifles they will probably use gas or bombs which are surprisingly easy to make.
15897,cm145b,"IDK who's downvoting you since you are making a, generally, reasonable argument. 

You mention gun access being the defining factor for our mass shootings, which a very simple answer for people to jump to. Yet, you can look at many countries that have stricter or looser gun laws than us that contradict your assertion that ease of access to guns cause ""Acts of terrorism"". Mexico has stricter gun laws than the US, our southern neighbor, and yet we still have a significantly lower mass shooting rate. Canada has easier access to guns than mexico does, yet has a lower mass shooting, murder and suicide rate the Mexico. More similar examples can be seen with Brazil, Switzerland, Sweden and other countries. Ease of access to guns  isn't going to fix our problem, and will only serve to remove rights from people. 

You are right, people can walk and chew gum at the same time. But the people have only so much attention they can give to events that occur, and mass shootings get a large amount of that attention and make people think that mass shooting are a large issue. Companies sell bulletproof equipment camouflaged as school supplies/backpacks and have a sustainable business model BECAUSE people are unnecessarily scared about mass shootings than is actually realistic(again 1% of all gun related deaths are mass shootings)

Now i mention suicide because, in a lot of ways, the causes of suicide are similar to that of mass shootings, people that dislike how they view the world and wanting to make a drastic change. For people that only commit suicide, they make that change by doing the only thing they feel they can do: stop experiencing anything at all. For people who commit mass shootings, they also want to make other aware of their pain or where their pain stems from and kill others while sometimes providing reasons for having done their actions. We should come up with solutions that can actually deal with these events, and not just provide bandage solutions. 

Finally your last point is probably the worst argument of all. ""who cares!"" Completely dismiss the people that you need to convince to get what you want done. Completely ignore the fact that the majority of gun owners are law abiding citizens, and want to be law abiding citizens, but we should all pay for the few bad people with an ineffective solution. This also implies to me that you may not actually care about talking things out and being empathetic to my views, because you have already made up your mind, similar to how a racist already knows all there is to know about other people (not to say you are racist). This is how you push gun enthusiasts from wanting to cooperate with you or listen to you, because you don't actually care about what they want. 

Even if you feel the rest of my points are not convincing in the slightest, i hope that at least my last point of expressing a dismissive attitude to the other side is the thing that you shouldn't ever do."
15898,cm145b,"Despite the possibility that white nationalists will switch to other forms of attack like knives, trucks, or bombings for their mass murders, why wouldn’t the American people at least try to decrease the most prominent cause weapon-related deaths? I also think it would be ironic if white nationalists who constantly condemn bombings in the name of Islam would switch to condoning bombings in the name of “American Patriotism”."

Their reason is always the same, ""my vote doesn't count."" In my opinion that's a bullshit, cop-out excuse, but I can't convince them to vote. I've even shown them examples of when votes have **literally** been determined by a coin flip because the vote ended in a tie, and yet their rebuttal is always, ""has that happened here?""

I wish I knew a way I could convince these people to vote, but nothing I say seems to matter to them. Hell I'm in NC and there's a constitutional amendment on the ballot which will give our state one of the most strict voter ID laws in the country, and nobody I know gives a shit."

How are the bridges and roads you drive on? Ever hear of the bridge collapse in Minneapolis? Do you think the idea of creating energy from wind or solar is compelling? Should going to college be more affordable without being saddled with a lifetime of debt pique your interest at all?

15960,9rqlcv,"That's anecdotal, it doesn't really prove much. What I said was also anecdotal, so it wasn't meant to be as a general consensus. There are some surveys and studies out there that can probably examine the general consensus of young voters more accurately, what I've found is generally according to these studies, young voters feel like most laws dont affect young voters as much as they do older voters, which is why theres a higher turnout for older voters. There isn't just one reason though, I'm just giving an example of what I researched.



But I do hear alot of ""my vote doesn't count"" thing, idk why people feel like that."
15961,9rqlcv,"I wholeheartedly agree every word you said. From my experience my peers and classmates have said during class discussions that the reason they don't vote is because most of the things being voted for dont affect them as much, for young people, as they do for older people. Things like healthcare, young people are usually ""healthy"" so they dont think about healthcare issues until they're older,  or you mention the collapsing bridge, not many of millenials and post millennials drive as much previous generations. Thats one big reason why young people are just unintetested. Although my entire statement is based a few class discussions in sociology. Nevertheless, I disagree with them because even policies like social security, it doesnt effect us young people but voting for people to keep in place will help us in the future and will help others as well. I wont wait until im 30 to start being involved when laws affect me more than in the past, im 21, I will vote for my present and for my future as well."

15968,9rqlcv,I am certain my boy would never touch. 
15969,9rqlcv,"I didn't mean to discount your statement, nor was I trying to be argumentative, I was simply stating that as a fact about my life.

When it comes to how politics effect my own life, it's much less than a lot of these people I know, be it them having children who are enrolled into a public school (and they won't research or vote on the members of their school board,) or people who sell marijuana (who won't research or vote on the county sheriff, where a current candidate wants to stop sentencing for intent to sell marijuana.)

Hell I've even tried to guilt trip my best friend into voting by saying he obviously doesn't care about the future of his children if he doesn't even care about who's running the school his child is attending, and once again his argument is always ""my vote doesn't count.""

I'm simply at a complete loss on how to convince someone like him to vote. I feel like it should be easier to convince someone to vote on a county level where ~80,000 votes is on the high end in terms of voter turnout.

Personally I've voted in every single election since I've been eligible, which was 2008, and yet I can name a dozen people who've never cast a ballot. I guess it wouldn't irk me so bad if it wasn't for the state that I live in, where gerrymandering is a huge problem so the general assembly is nearly always a Republican majority while the governor is generally a Democrat. But measure such as one of the constitutional amendments they're trying to pass will make it to where the General Assembly gives the Governor a list of candidates he can appoint to the Supreme Court, rather than the Governor choosing and then the GA approving his appointment. (Which all 5 living former Governors, Republican and Democrat, say you should vote against.)

I'm not sure what state you live in, but the current constitutional amendments on the ballot in NC are downright power grabs by the Republican controlled General Assembly to strip powers from the Democratic Governor. If you're interested you should read up on them at [ACLU of North Carolina's website.](https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/en/news/election-protect-our-state-constitution-vote-against-every-amendment) Hell, some of them are so vague and worded so poorly on the ballot that even uninformed Democrats will probably vote yes on quite a few of these amendments."

>Republicans in 2016 won 10 of the 13 House districts - 77 percent of them - despite getting just 53 percent of the statewide vote, nearly the same result as in 2014.

I'm not aware if the voting districts have been redrawn as of yet, but we'll see as the General Assembly will still get the final say, and they've been very unashamed about how they manipulated the district lines.

I would hope the Supreme Court decision would put the fear of God into them, but with Trump being president and a now Republican leaning Supreme Court, I'm not so certain."

15996,5v7yop,"I'm incredibly furious about this, because for years now people have been saying ""well you have to give Milo a platform because free speech"", and now suddenly they're in agreement that he should be dropped by CPAC. So basically, they never actually believed in absolute free speech at all, they were just specifically okay with racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, doxxing and harassment. They accept that some things are not up for debate, but think the basic humanity of women and minorities is one of the things that is.

Oh and this isn't even news, we've known about Milo and paedophilia for years. He supported Gamergate when they were running out of a child porn site (and posted there), and people still insisted he be allowed to speak at universities, only backing down when he made the 'respectable' conservatism of CPAC look bad."

16005,5v7yop,"""I am a gay man, and a child abuse victim. 

I would like to restate my utter disgust at adults who sexually abuse minors. I am horrified by pedophilia and I have devoted large portions of my career as a journalist to exposing child abusers. I've outed three of them, in fact -- three more than most of my critics. And I've repeatedly expressed disgust at pedophilia in my feature and opinion writing. My professional record is very clear. 

But I do understand that these videos, even though some of them are edited deceptively, paint a different picture. 

I'm partly to blame. My own experiences as a victim led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous. But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, ""advocacy."" I deeply regret that. People deal with things from their past in different ways. 

As to some of the specific claims being made, sometimes things tumble out of your mouth on these long, late-night live-streams, when everyone is spit-balling, that are incompletely expressed or not what you intended. Nonetheless, I've reviewed the tapes that appeared last night in their proper full context and I don't believe they say what is being reported. 

I do not advocate for illegal behavior. I explicitly say on the tapes that I think the current age of consent is ""about right."" 

I do not believe sex with 13-year-olds is okay. When I mentioned the number 13, I was talking about the age I lost my own virginity. 

I shouldn't have used the word ""boy"" -- which gay men often do to describe young men of consenting age -- instead of ""young man."" That was an error. 

I am certainly guilty of imprecise language, which I regret. 

Anyone who suggests I turn a blind eye to illegal activity or to the abuse of minors is unequivocally wrong. I am implacably opposed to the normalization of pedophilia and I will continue to report and speak accordingly.""

16033,5v7yop,"Milo was abused himself by a trusted authority figure. But he doesn't see it as an adult sexually grooming a minor, he sees it as the romantic ideal of an older man bringing a young boy into adulthood.

You can read his Facebook apology and when you keep in mind that he lost his virginity at 13 to an adult man and *sees nothing wrong with that* why his apology sounds pretty weak.

At some point he's going to be forced to come straight out and denounce how he lost his virginity as sexual abuse. But then he'll be a victim of sexual abuse and the right will toss him aside.

Milo is in the position where he is defending what happened to him as not sexual abuse. He was kind of like ""Eh, it happened to me and it wasn't bad."" Now he's being forced to admit that if it happened to some other kid, it would be wrong. But he still seems to think that the way he lost his virginity was cool. Because he was a *mature* 13.

He's in a weird position and like they say, you can't come back from diddling kids. Unless you're The Church.

16034,5v7yop,"I don't think there we're NO downsides to her, but that they were mostly blown far out of proportion. I don't approve of jet use of a private email server, for example, but to go from that to she's more corrupt than trump or that her judgement is bad across the board is an extreme over reaction. Same with her charity being used to paint her as corrupt in spite of no evidence of serious conflicts. The email leaks had some bad things in them, but people literally linked her to actual satanic rituals based on them. Clintons flaws were like having the flu. Trump's are more like polio: far worse, and something we thought we put behind up as a society decades ago. "
16035,5v7yop,"Whats weird to me is how people seriously relate far left with hillary.

16037,5v7yop,"Well, it certainly is productive to continue rehashing the election. As someone on the left, I definitively have seen more people acknowledge Hillary's shortcomings. The problem is, those on the right have this idea that because she's a democrat, we all stand behind her 100%, just like Trump supporters. We don't. I can almost guarantee that her biggest critics would be people on the left. We don't fall in line quite as easily on the left."
16038,5v7yop,"Who? Where? I've seen nearly every Hillary supporter acknowledge at least a few things they don't like about her, and many either acknowledge a lot or explicitly voted for her because she was the lesser of two evils. "

Or his comments on ""come on, haven't you ever seen a 15 year old girl that you wanted to fuck?"" This has nothing to do with him being sexually abused. "
16043,5v7yop,"> “We get hung up on this sort of child abuse stuff to the point where we are heavily policing consensual adults . . . In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men — the sort of ‘coming of age’ relationship — those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can’t speak to their parents.""


For the record, I'm not ""attacking"" him. I just think he's a shitty person, and I would think the same even if he wouldn't have gone on record defending relationships between grown men and young boys."
16044,5v7yop,"I mean, Hillary wanted to put a no-fly zone over Aleppo that would've led to direct confrontation between the US and Russia, that could potentially be nuclear.

I find the downplaying of this by many mainstream democrats to be outright frightening.

Or have you maybe forgotten the cold war... Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan... There were planes from Soviets and Americans shot down by each other, but no one entered a nuclear war. Even when Cuba was supposed to get nukes, the world didn't get into a nuclear war. And that was 2 fully armed navies going up against each other. 

Guess those events matter less than a no fly zone where you tell everyone they can't fly over it cause you might shoot down their planes. If Russia does a no fly zone, people tend to respect it. Even if they disagree with it. 

Then you talk and make an argument why it should or shouldn't be a no fly zone.

You don't just start throwing nukes left and right cause one plane was shot down."

16062,5v7yop,"Lol Russia Today, saved myself a click

Edit since comments are locked:. 
  

Okay so to be fair and aside from my snark, it did take a few pages on Google to find an article about the no fly zone comments without as an obvious stake as Russia Today so here's one from the BBC. The short is  enforcement = fighting Asad = fighting Russia. That said, this level of human rights crisis and war crimes does warrant intervention. Despite war fatigue it is a different situation than Iraq and perhaps more direct US military action is needed. It would be a test in Russian investment to the Asad alliance, sure but Russia doesn't want to go war with the US either so maybe that alliance isn't as strong as worth igniting full blown WWIII.  I'm not a Middle East foreign policy expert, but the State Dept and Clinton have give this much more thought and know the implications. 
  

https://www.google.com/amp/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/37621825 


""Last month in a Congressional hearing, General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked what he thought about the imposition of a no-fly zone to halt the barrel-bombing in Aleppo.

His response was clear. ""Right now"", said the highest ranking US serving officer, ""for us to control all of the air space in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia; that's a pretty fundamental decision…"" . . .  

. . . with Russia firmly engaged alongside the Assad regime, any kind of direct US intervention would raise the stakes to a dramatic level.""   "

16064,5v7yop,"Flynnghazi. Third in the campaign with links to Russia. 

Why is it that even when presented with the opportunity Trump can't say 1 thing that's critical of Russia?"
16065,5v7yop,"You literally said far left. Nothing about Hillary is left. The left doesn't like her one bit.

And yeah, she's all about that. But it shouldn't be any surprise to anyone paying attention. Politics is about power, and she wants to keep it for herself and those around her. Trump(and more mainstream republicans) do the exact same shit. Hell, even the ""libertarian"" republicans are still proponents of big government so long as it's *their* government. "
16066,5v7yop,"So **no one** like that has ever posted anything online?  It's impossible to link to a single example of what you're talking about?  

Go home, comrade.  "
16067,5v7yop,"> If your only response to Trump being terrible is ""but her emails!"" 

This is completely nonsensical.  No one on the left -- literally zero people -- respond to Trump's many failings with a sincere ""but her emails!"".  If you disagree, link to **one single** instance of this.  You can't, because it's never happened, ever.  

""But her emails!"" was the *right's* defense of *Trump* during the campaign.  The left is now throwing that weak justification back in their faces as Trump becomes less and less defensible by rational people.  And it's ludicrous to claim that this has been the left's ""only response"" to Trump's lunacy.  

> chances are you do not see her as a bad candidate

You either don't quite understand what we're discussing, or you're intentionally avoiding it.  The claim was not ""people don't see Hilary as too bad of candidate""; the claims was ""people on the far left pretended that there were *no* downsides to Hillary.""  There is an obvious difference between these two claims, yet you've twice now tried to steer the conversation towards the former rather than the latter.  "
16068,5v7yop,"Yes yes, ignore the evidence that is coming directly from the horse's mouth."
16069,5v7yop,"It's one thing to be friends with Russia, it's completely another to say that he's handed Putin the keys! "
16070,5v7yop,"I also literally corrected myself in a post under it and said I meant hardcore mainstream democrats, sorry for the confusion"
16071,5v7yop,What are you talking about? My personal experience in life doesn't matter because I can't prove it to you on the spot? What kind of a basis for conversation is that? 
16072,5v7yop,"Alright, so I sorta represented what the ""but her emails"" comments meant. To act like there are not people in r/politics or r/hillaryclinton that actually believe there was nothing wrong with her is wrong as well. If I need to bring you proof then fine, it will be present tomorrow in r/politics and I will just show it to you."
16073,5v7yop,"There's almost two years of discussion on Clinton you can pull from --  backing up your claim that there was any significant number of people who thought she was perfect would be trivial, if you could actually do it.  "
16074,ai9xph,"I'm very excited! Her announcement email to those on her mailing list was great. Some snippits:

>Together, we will fight FOR a country where getting a **college** education doesn’t mean taking on a lifetime of debt. Where middle-class and working families are prioritized with **tax breaks, not corporations** or the wealthiest 1%. Where every single person can retire with dignity. Where every single person can breathe **clean air** and drink **clean water.** Where **Black women aren’t three to four times more likely to die in childbirth** than white women.

16079,ai9xph,"Democrats are going to have so many awesome primary choices for 2020.

16082,ai9xph,"Here’s a factor that a lot of people aren’t talking about: as a woman of color, it’ll be harder for Trump to attack her without coming off as racist"
16083,ai9xph,Part of me really likes all the options we are going to have in the primary next year. Most of me realizes this is going to be a shit show where the good candidates split a bunch of votes and someone shitty gets through like trump did in 16. 
16084,ai9xph,"Just an instinct at this point, and I’m happy to change my mind, but I don’t think either Harris or Warren are great national candidates. I’m curious what kind of speech Klobuchar gives and how Sherrod Brown will play in front of the camera. "

16087,ai9xph,I would love to see her as the next President. I think she'd pair well with Klobuchar or O'Rourke.
16088,ai9xph,"I’m concerned about yet another candidate without foreign policy experience. Her resume doesn’t appear to have any, maybe I’m wrong? "
16089,ai9xph,"Fantastic. Harris is a true fighter; has hardcore prosecutor experience and won't fall for stupid tricks like blotus' ""poke and haunt us"". She's woke and fierce. I'm 72 and have seen a lot of rodeos; she's ready."
16090,ai9xph,"This is a terrible idea for Democrats. 

She also let Mnuchin and other mortgage bandits  who got rich illegally evicting Californian’s via robo-signing off scot-free. "
16091,ai9xph,"That’d be an L. And I don’t even care for the turd that is trump. Just seems more like the fluff candidate, in that she’ll be one of the missile magnets for the “real candidate” and will get set up with a sweet AG job if dems should win. "

16094,ai9xph,"Interesting. I went through her Wikipedia page and checked out her political stances. Honestly she seems pretty well what I’ve wanted for awhile now. Obviously things change and I may not like her later on, but I would support her as of now. "
16095,ai9xph,I guess someone has to keep our attention before the real candidates finally enter he race.
16096,ai9xph,"I'm about as moderate as it gets, so I'm glad to see differing ideologies choosing to run on the Democratic side. I'm not too well versed on her policy, but it seems criminal justice reform is her passion. I honestly think that's great, because I think its something both Dems and Repubs see as a issue that needs to be addressed. I hope, if elected, that is her first issue to tackle so it gets both sides talking again. Interested to see how she navigates this race, which will likely demand she goes farther left than maybe she is comfortable with. "
16097,ai9xph,Can we please just not have the same 15-people-on-the-stage circus that the republicans had? We need to run the most middle of the road wide-appeal person we can. People like Harris and Sanders are far more important in Congress than they are in the white house. A democratic president will sign anything a democratic congress sends to them. What we need is to get these progressive candidates to stay in Congress where they can do more good.

16101,ai9xph,"She certainly has the pedigree to beat Trump. Her track record as a DA kind of upsets me though, maximum penalties for non-violent drug crimes, maximum penalties for sex workers. She's definitely a ""win at all costs"" kind of person, which is a good thing most of the time. I don't think she's the best candidate to beat Trump, although I still think she would."
16102,ai9xph,I’m a left of center independent. Would definitely vote for her over any other Democrat and Trump. I think she has to be the favorite for those that have declared so far.
16103,ai9xph,"Damnit no.

Any Democrats announcing bids this early as basically sacrificial lambs, candidates for the media to latch onto and destroy.

I was hoping for Harris to *actually* run/become president in 2020. :("
16104,ai9xph,Oh Jesus Christ lets hope not. 
16105,ai9xph,"If the economy stays on track through 2020, I feel that Kamala Harris is the only Dem candidate who can beat Trump.  She will appeal to both moderate and left leaning Dems based on her policies and can cross over to moderately right-leaning voters based on her “tough on crime” background.  She is the only candidate right now who has the presence to go toe to toe with Trump in debates and we’ll need someone who can inspire the country with a positive vision for the future.

The radical progressive wing of the party will not support her but honestly, that’s a very small but annoyingly vocal portion of the voting public.  However, if the economy tanks between now and 2020, all bets are off."
16106,ai9xph,*shocked pikachu face*

16110,ai9xph,"Not sure she is my top choice, but if she gets the nod i'll vote for her. I like Warren better "
16111,ai9xph,"Commenting to read later on

"
16112,ai9xph,Where’s Bernie?
16113,ai9xph,"I’ll vote for her is she wins the nomination but she’s far from an ideal candidate and I don’t think she’d beat Trump in a general election.

I feel a Biden/Klobuchar ticket is our best option."
16114,ai9xph,I still believe we owe it to Bernie Sanders.
16115,ai9xph,"I need to do more research to decide who I'd want to vote for, but I just have to say...
Getting to watch Trump lose the presidency to a woman of color would make me so happy."

16123,ai9xph,Good luck to her.  I like her.  I like Elizabeth Warren.  I don't know much about Castro.  Big field.

16126,ai9xph,Northwest Indiana Democrat here. I think she is a solid choice! 
16127,ai9xph,Meh.
16128,ai9xph,"Hi there, Kamala Harris supports long sentences for nonviolent possession cases.

Thx for coming to my ted talk. "
16129,ai9xph,As I don’t have time to research all 20 of the people who are going to announce in the next month or so can someone give me the basics of what I need to know about her. 
16130,ai9xph,Meh. All of that is the same as virtually every other majors democrat. The only thing I’ve ever seen from Harris is how much reporters in podcasts I listen to talk about her. The only thing I know about her is she used to be a prosecutor...and a fairly conservative one at that.
16131,ai9xph,I love that there are specifics! 
16132,ai9xph,"Good choice of issues, but it would be better to see time-bound promises. I guess we might see that closer to the election."
16133,ai9xph,She leaves gun rights alone I'd probably vote for her 
16134,ai9xph,"Wow, these issues/words resonate so strongly with me. And I fail to imagine people not getting excited about this."
16135,ai9xph,"That would be the [Condorcet winner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_criterion?wprov=sfti1), the candidate who would beat any other candidate one on one. "
16136,ai9xph,"I don’t have sources handy but Warren has polled fairly well in Iowa and New Hampshire, I think. She’s a good candidate, but I’m not sure she excites people (even though her policies and track record should). She has roots in the middle class as well, I think she’d have a shot at beating trump. Harris is really going to excite people, but there are lots of people in key states who wouldn’t vote for a woman, let alone a black woman... we will see. I’d honestly prefer if both of these women stayed in the senate. They’re quite good at their jobs. "
16137,ai9xph,"Harris will get in the gutter, successfully, with Trump, Warren won't which is precisely why Harris can beat him and Warren can't.

16146,ai9xph,I have friends who are sex workers who hate her for aggressively prosecuting adult consenting nonviolent sex workers. 
16147,ai9xph,Did you watch her questioning of Barr in the confirmation hearing? She's changed. And not in a Romney/Clinton flip-floppy way; there's conviction in her. 
16148,ai9xph,"tbf, black politics and the war on drugs, tough on crime trend were very intertwined when Harris was starting her career, not opposed. Read *Locking Up Our Own* by James Forman."
16149,ai9xph,This liberal litmus test needs to end. Stop eating your own children and let’s put forth a candidate that can beat Trump.

16155,ai9xph,[removed]
16156,ai9xph,"And yet since nothing was resolved regarding superdelagates, the Dems will again nominate another corporate stooge.  Harris is just another 'do anything it takes to win' career politician. And by that I mean she'll end up taking a shitload of corporate money."
16157,ai9xph,"I think she does fire up the left side. I personally think a Brown-Harris ticket would be key to victory. He can bring back the Midwest with his strong support from Ohio and labor ties. She can solidify the coasts and key cities. He's white, she's black. 

My biggest concern is that it potentially makes the Ohio Senate seat vulnerable."
16158,ai9xph,Beto as VP 🤔
16159,ai9xph,You had me at “isn’t in her 70’s.”
16160,ai9xph,I fucking love her. 
16161,ai9xph,"Is she though? She comes from the district with the highest income disparity and highest homeless population. I admittedly don’t know much about her, but I would be cautious voting on anyone from the San Francisco Bay Area before they cleaned up their own backyard."
16162,ai9xph,"Texas here. She's been my top choice for most of the past 2 years.  
I think a west coast candidate would be a smart choice. Beto on the ticket with her from Texas could help drive that moderate middle-of-the-country vote.  
Biden/Harris would be my #2 choice, and as of right now what I'd call the ticket with the best chance to win, but I'd love to see Warren/Harris too.  "
16163,ai9xph,"Serious question, do you think that will matter to the people who have already decided to vote for him?"
16164,ai9xph,The thing is Trump doesn't give a shit about being called racist so this doesn't really matter 
16165,ai9xph,I think trump will get his base fired up because he’s going to speak to her in a racist/sexist way. 
16166,ai9xph,"What? This is a horrible mindset to have. 

Someone should be considered racist if they make racist remarks. Not just for ‘attacking’ someone of colour. "
16167,ai9xph,"Many of us don't consider this because it didn't matter. I mean, the guy is supported by ""patriots"" even though he straight up said he doesn't respect John McCain because he ""likes people who weren't captured."""
16168,ai9xph,"That term has all but been used to boy who cried wolf status 

It definitely doesn’t have as much weight as it did a few years ago, especially if it’s for things that are clearly reaching "
16169,ai9xph,"Remember when Democrats thought putting a woman forth as a candidate was a valid strategy? I do.

Edit: ""First woman"" Potus is not a strategy, to clarify. Honestly couldn't care less about what is in their pants. "
16170,ai9xph,So she can use her gender and color as a shield from criticism? Why is that a good thing? 
16171,ai9xph,"Right, which is why it’d be easy for him. 

Not that I don’t support Harris as a nominee, just that she’s gonna get Michelle + Hillary level hate from Don John regardless. "
16172,ai9xph,Why does that matter?
16173,ai9xph,"Yeah, history has proven its TERRIBLE for Trump when he comes off as racist... "
16174,ai9xph,Republicans do not use Political Correctness (even basics)
16175,ai9xph,[removed]
16176,ai9xph,"I looked at her voting record and she's got a 98.79 lifetime score at progressive punch. That's good for third highest in the Senate behind Warren and Markey.

Were you maybe thinking of someone else?"
16177,ai9xph,"Ooo, Klobuchar would be a good running mate! Well-respected and liked by her constituents. "
16178,ai9xph,Why do people like Klobuchar? The only time I’ve ever heard anything about her is when a couple podcasts I listen to say she might be running.
16179,ai9xph,"The only people with foreign policy experience would be President, VP, and defense/state secratary. Obama is ineligible, Biden might run, Hillary already ran. Idk who else would fit your litmus test. "
16180,ai9xph,Ya because Trumps experience with foreign policy was a cornerstone of his campaign! I'm not staying you like Trump but we need someone to represent the people of this country. We don't need someone bought and paid for by the Russians.
16181,ai9xph,Totally agree. 
16182,ai9xph,"Nobody seems to know about Jay Inslee. He’s got essentially the same politics as all of them, but he’s a successful governor who has made Climate Change his main focus."
16183,ai9xph,Hopefully we’ll get two of them cause one will slide into a VP role early enough.
16184,ai9xph,This is what building a deep bench and party infrastructure looks like. It should hurt a bit being forced to choose among many great candidates.

Not so much when she was CA AG. Jacobin Mag has a long, but good read on her uneven record."
16194,ai9xph,"Why do we have to go middle of the road? Why not go with the person who will energize the base and get out the youth vote? We need more people to go to the polls, and more of the same isn't going to do it."
16195,ai9xph,"> Would definitely vote for her over Trump.

But that's like saying water is wet.

"
16196,ai9xph,"I don’t think it’s like that. The important candidates who are announcing now - Warren, Harris, and maybe Gillibrand - are all Senators whose biggest problem going into the primary is a lack of name recognition outside their home states. They need as much time as they can to overcome that obstacle. The candidates who can afford to wait are Biden, Sanders, and (if she ran again) Clinton, because most Americans and basically all Democrats already know who they are. The candidates who don’t already have a national profile will suffer in a crowded field, and if they don’t put in a respectable showing in the first few primaries it’s probably GG.

"
16197,ai9xph,hopefully in his lake house for the next two years.
16198,ai9xph,I really don’t think you’re going to se another all white ticket on the Dem side for a while. 
16199,ai9xph,"Nope. I was 100% Bernie for 20+ years. After seeing him cave on the Russian sanction votes. Adios, pal."
16200,ai9xph,Oh god last thing we need is more Bernie bots when they get pissed and vote GOP like for tRump.
16201,ai9xph,"Owe ain't got nothing to do with it. 

Some people said we owe it to Hillary, lol. "
16202,ai9xph,That may honestly happen with in the GOP primary if Nikki Haley runs...
16203,ai9xph,What do you dislike about her platform?
16204,ai9xph,I agree that is disappointing. She will surely have to answer questions about it during the primary. But lets avoid this thing where we write somebody off because of one decision we disagree with. I don't even agree with myself 100% of the time.
16205,ai9xph,Same state is just not ever going to happen.

16211,ai9xph,These are NOT specifics.
16212,ai9xph,"Hrmm, I don't think the idea of Condorcet winner is really relevant here. It comes up when discussing voting systems, and how in a singular election your system should ideally pick the winner who would beat any other option one on one.

Here, we're discussing how we should tailor the primary victor to be the most competitive general election candidate. The Condorcet winner of the primary might not be the most competitive general election candidate. "

16214,ai9xph,You mean Bernie? 
16215,ai9xph,"People didn't think a black man could win either, especially one with an exotic name like Barack Hussein Obama. Give people a chance to surprise you."
16216,ai9xph,Warren lost it for me when she was to afraid to publicly  back Bernie in the primary. That showed me she doesn’t have the guts for a presidential election.
16217,ai9xph,Completely agree. Exactly my thinking.
16218,ai9xph,You need to have a candidate who will completely ignore him. Anyone that tries to “get in the gutter” with him will make a fool of themselves and fail.

16223,ai9xph,Because irony
16224,ai9xph,Care to share your findings with us?
16225,ai9xph,Because Trump is racist. So it only makes it more ironic.
16226,ai9xph,Could you elaborate? I've heard of Krasner but haven't followed the situation too closely 
16227,ai9xph,"There’s a really huge difference between “her offices position” and “an argument made in court by someone working under her”

16228,ai9xph,[deleted]
16229,ai9xph,"She should still have to explain some of her past actions though, especially the innocent man who is serving decades for a crime he didn't commit."
16230,ai9xph,"It's 2 years until the election. Once there is a nominee, then we all back him or her. United Front Against Trump. 

Until then we should be questioning the candidates and figuring out, what they really stand for. 

We're not just trying to win the horse race. We're trying to make a better nation."
16231,ai9xph,"There’s going to be 15+ primary candidates, a large pool of which will be able to beat Trump. How do you suggest we differentiate among that pool?"
16232,ai9xph,"While I hate strict liberal litmus tests, that's also kind of the entire point of primaries. Let people decide what their priorities are and vote for the candidate they feel represents that best. Especially in a year like 2020 where the party's diverse factions need to feel like they have a seat at the table. Even just a few pledged delegates supporting a candidate at the convention that won't win the nomination can sway the Party's platform towards key issues.

If a significant amount of people voice their concern about her record as a prosecutor, it can signal to people that the Democratic Party is serious about criminal justice reform. If she wins even in the face of that concern, then it can signal to the country that we're both serious about reform while not necessarily willing to become ""soft on crime,"" which can help us win folks in the middle.

The one thing I won't stand for are litmus test after the primaries. That's what I hated about the numerous Berniecrats who I've come in contact with who held Hillary to such a litmus test that they somehow couldn't vote for her. To me, they signaled they have no interests in actually being Democrats. "
16233,ai9xph,Figuring out who our best candidate will be isn’t in our best interest? Wtf are you talking about. We obviously backed the wrong horse last election and we should be scared shitless of making that mistake again
16234,ai9xph,"Why not choose a candidate who doesn’t have a past that conflicts with our values? Choosing a half measure candidate is the reason we lost the last election. If we do that again, we’ll probably lose again. "
16235,ai9xph,If they can't handle legitimate criticism then they're not a strong enough candidate. 
16236,ai9xph,Like Bernie Sanders right?
16237,ai9xph,"Only candidate that will beat trump
Is Biden. "
16238,ai9xph,"I don't trust prosecutors to be progressive, plain and simple. Next."
16239,ai9xph,"To be fair, primaries are the time when these types of things should be discussed.  

It's not enough of an issue that I would vote for Trump (or not vote, which is the same thing), but it's certainly something that should be brought up."
16240,ai9xph,"That’s not really nitpicking though, is it? The criminal justice system in the US is a shit show and overly aggressive prosecution is at the heart of the problem. "
16241,ai9xph,"Calm down, people can have opinions or criticisms.  Or do you not allow that?"

16247,ai9xph,"I, too, would rate Beto as a Big Think. He's definitely the right progressive for Texas, but his oil-gas donations are definitely not simpatico the Democratic National Platform. I understand that being a Texas politician means that you are likely to need oil-gas industry support ^(but maybe that means that Texas politicians are generally not the best choice for the executive branch..)"

16250,ai9xph,Beto/Harris in my mind would be the best ticket possible. Beto for Pres (as I think he's the most motivating for folks outside of the Dem base) and Kamala as his pit bull VP. 
16251,ai9xph,"No, but you have to remember that there were plenty of:

In all seriousness, foreign policy experience shouldn't be a factor this election. How can we be a force for good in the world when our government is a disaster? IMO we need to prioritize a radical, transformative social agenda and deep, thorough electoral reform (campaign finance, corruption, election integrity, DC/PR statehood, adding SC justices, et al.).

16284,ai9xph,It’s not about what people say it’s about the heartfelt honesty. The only reason Bernie lost is because Hillary said some B.S about him being an old man. 2016 elections were the worst I’ve seen. Bernie was the only one who didn’t act like a rat with rabies. And even he was pretty bad because to win that election you had to be the worst/dirtiest candidate(which is why trump won). If we are being honest with our selves Bernie is the best option we have.

16321,ai9xph,"I think you’ve got that order flipped, and I can only think of one reason why...

As a Senator, Harris is way more qualified to be President and unlike O’Rourke she actually has substantive ideas.

Sure he’s charismatic, but listen to this interview with a Washington Post reporter: https://overcast.fm/+PmW451B44

“Let’s have a national conversation about that” on every major issue is an unacceptable answer. Firstly, because what does that even mean? Secondly, because leadership means actually having to set the agenda.

He’s not qualified to be President at all."
16322,ai9xph,"I'd want Kamala at the top of the ticket because...  
1. I think a female at the top will be a driver for the Dems in 2020. Hillary was a flawed candidate for many women (not that we need to rehash why she was/was not actually flawed again).  
2. Harris will decimate Trump in debates and not pull punches. Beto is a decent debator, but watching his performances against Cruz early on it took him a while to find his footing. Harris will *not* pull punches and she'll dance circles around Trump. Hillary was too cordial with Trump. Beto probably would be too. We need her on national television going right at him. Biden would be good there too.  
3. Beto is currently not in Congress. Yes, Lincoln was in the House, lost a Senate bid, and won the Presidency 2 year later, so Beto could follow that path. It's been done. But it's much more unlikely today. I think Harris being a current member of Congress makes her a stronger candidate. Biden doesn't need to be in now because he already has a lifetime of service behind him.  
But if Beto does somehow end up at the top of the ticket, I'd obviously support him. I just think he's a weaker candidate who'd serve better in a campaigning/support role a-la VP."

16337,ai9xph,"Trump is the ultimate Republican form. He is the epitome of their hypocrisy and shows why their ideas can not be taken seriously.

For years the Republican party has spouted off its concerns when it comes to Democrats while ignoring those same things for itself. Obama was  too inexperienced but Trump's inexperience makes him great. It is all about fiscal conservatism when a Democrat is in power but they support Trump's giant economic waste of a wall and deficit creating tax cuts without event a hint of irony. It is time for democrats to stop allowing Republicans to set the agenda and to talk to the American people. 

Democrats should lay out plans for strengthening our alliances but also be mindful that majority don't want simply increased militarism. In other words, Democrats need to lead without worrying about what some idiots in the conservative media are going to say about it. "
16338,ai9xph,"Yeah, if his carbon tax had passed either of the two times he tried it, maybe, but he's better as a cabinet member."

16342,ai9xph,"Warren's senate seat is too valuable, and she's too old. Needs to be someone younger. Maybe Ro Khanna, if he wants to maintain ideological consistency across his ticket."
16343,ai9xph,"Totally agree.  That would be a ticket that could ensure progressive success for years to come.  Bernie with Warren as VP, or Beto if he comes around to Medicare for all, would annihilate Donald Trump’s faux populism."
16344,ai9xph,"I think new energy can come in different forms. FiveThirtyEight mentioned a while back (I think in one of their live chats) that most successful Presidential candidates champion a big, popular idea by presenting a serious problem and making the case that they can fix it best. I don't think taking down Trump or other negative/retributive inspiration is the best platform.

The two issues that stand out by a mile are Medicare for All and a Green New Deal, paid for by taxing the rich and cutting military spending. Bernie is the entire reason M4A is in the discussion, and he was the first candidate to back GND and is very closely connected to its organizers. He championed the rhetoric of making a system that doesn't favor the 1%. He may be old, but he is leading the field on all of the biggest social issues. I'm sure others will jump on the bandwagons (as many have already done on M4A) but how can we trust that they are true proponents and not just taking the stance to get elected?"
16345,ai9xph,He opened the door to folks who can do it better than him. Harris is a machine.

16348,ai9xph,Heads up against Bernie I give her a shot. Biden I feel like would run over the field if he ran. 
16349,ai9xph,Honestly I have no idea what you're talking about. 
16350,ai9xph,"- You can offer tax subsidies to the middle class and balance it by raising taxes on the wealthy. Also, the deficit is not really all that important in the short or medium term. 

- The housing issues is complicated but your position contains a lot of simplifications as well. Certainly “burdensome process of developing real estate” is not the main cause of a lack of affordable housing. The main cause is that incomes are not high enough, and the costs imposed by regulation isn’t a game changer here: https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-affordable-housing-shortage-considering-the-problem-causes-and-solutions

Solutions to the housing problems in expensive cities will need to be multi pronged and her idea is a fine if incomplete suggestion.

- Overall, it sounds like you are just ideologically opposed to her economic policies, which you can come out and say without calling someone an idiot. If you are an ideological “market liberal” then yeah a left of center dem probably isn’t going to do it for you. But you are being dishonest to present these as issues where she is either an idiot or a bad person, as though everyone who is smart or informed would agree with your policy positions.

16352,ai9xph,"""The sky is blue, I want it so people can have a roof over them with one job"". None of this has any detail to it, whatsoever. If she delivers her specific plan on how to accomplish that, they can then be called specifics. Until then, this stuff is an empty idea."
16353,ai9xph,"I am highly unlikely to vote for Harris. I’m a never-Trump moderate/conservative who has historically voted republican but will not vote for anyone who I believe has ever lied to support Trump. However, my conservative priorities are significant enough that I’m unlikely to vote for a democrat. All that to say this: I agree with everything on her platform, but will not vote for her. It’s the details of how these things are fleshed out where I disagree with her. However, I can agree with her platform because it’s (deliberately) vague. "
16354,ai9xph,How do those things happen?
16355,ai9xph,"I don't know why the idea of Condorcet winner applies there either, this is just an argument of general election electibility.

The only thing it maybe brings up is that in a Bernie-Clinton-Trump general election, there might be no condorcet winner (Bernie beats Trump, Trump *beat* Clinton, Clinton beats Bernie). But that was never an election that could happen in our 2 party system.

There's no need to consider a Condorcet winner when we have an election system that blatantly ignores it.

"
16356,ai9xph,"Taking that chance worked with Barack Obama. It could work again. OTOH, ""playing it safe"" with Hillary Clinton lost the election. The Democratic party needs to rethink what it knows about how to motivate voters."

I'm not American but somehow i get the impression that this kind of reasoning is exactly what gave you Trump. Policies take a backseat to the figurehead competition.   "
16373,ai9xph,"Based on Trump's approval and current polling, a lot of Democrats can probably beat Trump. I think Sanders, Biden, Harris, and O'Rourke would all beat him as things stand now. The states that he narrowly won to tip 2016 went resoundingly blue in the midterms. We should be doing our due diligence to pick the best nominee not just to beat Trump, but who can deliver a complete agenda to undo the damage he's done, prevent it from ever happening again, and give people something to hope for and get behind that isn't just Trump opposition.


The Green New Deal is a great opportunity for Dems to ~~echo FDR and~~ offer voters transformative change to help fix our economy for the middle class and save our environment. Waiting to see whether Harris will endorse it or offer a plan of her own. I think she'd be great to go after Trump's corruption, but I'd need to see more from her on proactive policies to fix the economy and environment before I'd support her. If she isn't the nominee, I'd love to see her as USAG, although she would leave big shoes to fill on Senate Judiciary."
16374,ai9xph,"I’ve never heard of her before in my life, trump shouldn’t be hard to beat but why do you have so much confidence in her?"
16375,ai9xph,"Take my upvote. Kamala will chew Trump to bits, so much so that she barely captures the presidency because white men who claim to be inclusive and accepting but really just ride the inequality choo choo will be terrified and secretly vote (again) for Trump out of self-preservation."

16381,ai9xph,"Nothing wrong with nitpicking any and all candidates in the primaries, they're going to get a lot more attacks than a simple resume check soon enough. 

People are looking for a candidate that resonates with them at a deeply personal level, who holds all the beliefs they hold, has similar stances, and acts in the way they would want an extension of themselves to act. So, when they learn about a candidate's action that doesn't adhere to their morals, it's fine to take issue. 

It's fine. What is necessary is for dems to not do a ""Bernie or Bust"" and ultimately unify and vote for whoever ends up winning the nomination even if they weren't their first choice. "

16385,ai9xph,"I certainly understand what you're saying, but I'm thinking about success at the end of the day. I agree that Harris is way more qualified, but I don't think she has the same appeal as Beto. He's got time to brush up on policy and really hone his message. I would actually prefer to see Warren/Harris or Harris/Warren as the ticket because to me that's the most qualified. I know that will never happen even though it should."
16386,ai9xph,"She’s way more qualified because she spent 2 years in the senate? You know she was elected in 2016, right? 

O’Rourke spent 6 years in the House. I really have no idea what you’re trying to gain from this point. 

Plus, I believe that interview is traditionally vague from someone who hasn’t decided on a platform yet. 

It’s very early to determine if somebody has ideas or not when nobody has a platform and the election is this far away. All Harris has said in national media is that she’s a fighter who’s going to listen to the American people. 

Seriously, you’re digging your heels in without having any idea about what Harris’ policies will be. 

Fucking why?







"
16387,ai9xph,"Beto could use 8 years as a VP to season him. He’s shown some greenness against Cruz, but he could prove to be invaluable for Dems trying to win back the heartland. "
16388,ai9xph,Facts no longer matter in debates. What matters is how many times you can interrupt your opponent and how “convincing” you can look.
16389,ai9xph,I think you need to remember how multiple 2016 candidates got hit for campaigning instead of doing their job. Him not having a role right now could actually help him.
16390,ai9xph,Hillary called Trump a Russian puppet to his face. I wouldn't say she was too cordial.
16391,ai9xph,So you're not goingng to contribute anything of substance I see. Just spam the same comment on different subs because you don't actually know how to defend your position. Good try bud.
16392,ai9xph,"They're everywhere and they're most impactful in those two states. But it's a waste of time and energy to convince to people who can't be reasoned with. Especially so when their more fluid thinking neighbors offer more value in terms of dollar-per-vote.

Conversely, what you can't do is take your own base for granted as 2016 has shown us. "
16393,ai9xph,"How so? Literally asking, not being fasecious.

Edit: The fact that I'm being downvoted says a lot. "
16394,ai9xph,"I don't think an apology tour will be remotely useful. We've destroyed allies' trust in us because they see how fragile our government is. The way to win it back is to focus inward on fixing the problems of corruption, misinformation, foreign cyber warfare, and electoral inequity that got us in this mess."
16395,ai9xph,"I mean, there must be some compromise as there is still a significant portion of the country that hold to conservative values, especially regarding fiscal/economic policy. They aren’t all too happy with Trump atm either. Nothing will ever get done if there is not some comprise, but that only works if in a situation without the mess of the executive we have now. Hypocrisy is a very common thing in politics, and although I (and presumably most people in this thread) believe that the Republicans are more guilty of it, we would be remiss to not notice that us liberals can also be guilty.

And for militarism, I think it just needs to be used where it makes sense. Fix the messes either we’ve made or are made for us (like not pulling completely out of Syria, showing Russia it doesn’t own Ukraine, and China it doesn’t own all the South China Sea). At least keeping our alliance strong is probably the most important thing, all the things Trump says about NATO make me shudder, it’s literally one of the most important things in the world."
16396,ai9xph,"I guess we'll see what the legislature does this term, but he's already focusing more on running for president than legislation. He's not throwing all his efforts behind a carbon bill through the legislature. "
16397,ai9xph,">We need a President who is willing to put everything else aside in order to solve this problem 

Inslee didn't even do that in WA. 

We need a Dem POTUS candidate that can inspire and not just beat Trump, but foster a wave that takes back the Senate, extends the house majority, and flips more state Governors and legislatures. Inslee is not that candidate. "
16398,ai9xph,"I think Bernie would be your best choice on that one. He's made it a priority of his advocacy, and was an early key supporter of the Green New Deal. I worry that other candidates will pay it lip service but not follow through because of the difficult and cost. I also think Warren will prioritize it but she was more cautious in her endorsement. Booker has endorsed the plan but he'll need to put his money where his mouth is since his record on climate isn't anything special.

I know Harris has spoken with GND organizers, but she hasn't formally endorsed the plan. Interested to see what her climate plan will be and how much of a priority she'll make it.

I actively distrust Biden or O'Rourke on this. I think they will support expanded drilling (as they have in the past) and will not take any concrete action to address the issue."
16399,ai9xph,"Yes, but we also need someone who will try hard to win. He hasn't done that yet so I don't see how that will be any different. "
16400,ai9xph,:(

16416,ai9xph,"I actually think Bernie's chances are higher than people give him credit for, and to be clear I'm not going to vote for him, and he's one of my last choices. The thing is though he'll probably have around 20-30% as a floor of his support, and while he probably doesn't have a really high ceiling, he could potentially do what Trump did in 2016 and just win a bunch of states early on with a plurality of the vote while the voters don't coalesce around a different candidate. "
16417,ai9xph,"You see, Kamala _was supposed_ to cause a constitutional crisis for the sake of prostitution."
16418,ai9xph,That's a lazy response. Prosecutors in the United States have near total control in how they enforce the law and Kamala has consistently shown poor judgement in her role.
16419,ai9xph,"I don't think her doing the job as a prosecutor while she was a prosecutor matters. Her job was literally to convict people for breaking laws, she didn't get to choose whether she liked the laws or not. "
16420,ai9xph,"Let’s find our best candidate by talking about the things we like about each candidate rather than focusing on every small flaw. Not saying her record isn’t important, but it seems like everyone’s reflex is to point out things they don’t like while ignoring the impressive qualities of pretty much all the candidates. 

Yes CJ reform is important, but she would be significantly better than Trump or any republican president. She’s not my favorite candidate by any means, but that doesn’t mean I need to attack her qualification to be the nominee every time someone posts an article. "
16421,ai9xph,Tulsi will beat her out as veteran and being aggressive to ending our intervention policy in the world. Only candidate who has seen the destruction of war.

This is only relevant if the election was winnable in the first place. Parties generally don't get a third term at the Presidency.

> How can you possibly know that?

How can you know that Bernie would've won?"
16424,ai9xph,Because he had laughably low support from the actual Democratic base aka older African American  men and especially women
16425,ai9xph,Are you saying people should not vote for their second choice if their first choice does not make it past the primaries? Or are you saying that people should not abstain from voting if their first choice does not make it past the primaries? 
16426,ai9xph,"Yeah, but he’s not Hispanic so I think it would be a stretch to assume he can translate that to Hispanic communities in Florida, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and other key states. 

I think his surge with Hispanics in Texas was more due to their support for any Democrat that seemed genuine in the face of a Trump GOP and Ted Cruz. "
16427,ai9xph,"Texan here and proud Beto for Senate supporter and volunteer. Beto's appeal will die real quick on the national stage. He's like Obama-lite. Decent on some of the things Obama excelled in. Moderates have better, more experienced options and liberals have options with consistent records of progressivism. Beto has no liberal track record and next to no experience.

I think he will be better off running for Cornyn's seat in 2020, or just taking time off and trying to return to politics in 2022 and run for governor against Abbott."
16428,ai9xph,"Agree completely.  
Harris then Beto could make a solid 16 years. But we're a long way from that dream right now. Lot can happen between now and 2020. I can't imagine where we'll be in 2028 the way the politically climate has been moving so violently over the past 5 years.  
All focus right now has to be on putting the best ticket forward in 2020, and as long as the Dems don't put up the Devil himself, it would be an improvement over Trump. Hell, at least Harvey Weintein had business sense. Yeah, I said it. I'd vote for Harvey Weinstein over Donald Trump. If you're gonna elect someone who sexually assaults people, can we at least elect a rapist who understands algebra and basic sentence structure?"
16429,ai9xph,"Facts never did matter in debates. Also no one wins a debate, you can only lose."

16431,ai9xph,"You’re right, his Carbon Tax failed in WA. But he stands by it even as it is politically toxic for every other candidate, including Sanders - the Carbon Tax is not part of the Green New Deal. 

If there is any chance at all of legitimate national action on Climate Change, it’s going to come from Inslee."
16432,ai9xph,The Green New Deal doesn’t include a Carbon Tax. It’s ridiculous that any environmental plan doesn’t include a policy that is widely regarded by economists and environmentalists as the most efficient way to combat Climate Change. Inslee is the only candidate with a Carbon Tax as part of his platform 
16433,ai9xph,He was the only governor who confronted Trump in a meeting last year. I think he’s got as good a shot as anyone at winning the general election if he somehow wins the primary 
16434,ai9xph,Kamala Harris IS a Senator... 
16435,ai9xph,He is not going to run. I will bet any money.
16436,ai9xph,"I voted for Hillary but she was not my first or second choice. I wish some of the people in the field for 2020 had entered it in 2016. Things might have been different. The huge, untapped demographic is the 18-30 year olds. We need to find out what they want."
16437,ai9xph,Im Part white  black  Arab and asian.    But trust me when I say we are just as black to them as our  Latin and African brothers.
16438,ai9xph,They think a wall will solve all their problems... They’re stuck in the 1360s.
16439,ai9xph,"Well then go ahead and explain what you meant by “were still calling people black just because one of their parents is black”. You don’t think we can call her black, I’m assuming using that same logic we can’t call her Indian... so what is she to you?"
16440,ai9xph,"You don't get to define ""black"" for me or anyone else who is bi-racial, and to suggest it is incredibly tone def. This shit gets hurled at us all the damn time. "
16441,ai9xph,"The problem with that strategy is that the Democratic party doesn't do winner-take-all states. Delegates are assigned proportionally, so winning with a plurality doesn't help him as much. His other big problem is that he's basically at his ceiling - people know him. He can't rely on being the underdog and swaying voters who didn't know him to his side like he did in 2015/2016. Now he has to change minds about people who are disinclined towards him, and I just don't see him doing that."
16442,ai9xph,"I’d actually argue that Bernie’s chance are a lot less than last time, as he’ll be splitting both the Left and the Anyone-But-Hillary vote. 

All while having pretty strong unfavorable from a good amount of the Dem base who were left with a bad taste in their mouths from him last time. "
16443,ai9xph,"Yeah, prosecutorial discretion exists, but it's not intended for an attorney general to flat out ignore laws they personally don't like, it's for them to prioritize resources of their department to make as many successful and high priority prosecutions as possible. Now if the Governor, as head of the state government, explicitly directs the AG to prioritize enforcement of some laws over others, that is another thing entirely and always politically controversial. What you are suggesting she could have done would be a constitutional crisis."
16444,ai9xph,"It was a lot more than that. She caused serious injustice for many people. She also did good for many people.

&#x200B;

Somehow i'm not too convinced you would be willing to apply the same reasoning for Trump. Don't get me wrong, i hope you succeed in getting a competent politician in the White House, but it won't get better until you start focusing on voting the opinions and accomplishments of candidates, rather than their public persona, skin color, genitals or awful fake tan."
16446,ai9xph,This is how you get neoliberals like Obama who talk a good game but can't back it up. Now is the time to be picky and ruthless in analyzing the D candidate. We can all fall in line come the general.
16447,ai9xph,"yeah i wouldn't oppose that statement. 

&#x200B;

It's just the sentiment from earlier comments that ""Let's find a person that has a character/persona that beats Trump, fuck their opinions we can figure that stuff out later"" that i believe to be a big contributor to the current obscene state of the democratic process in the states. I think the track record since Nixon speaks for itself. "

16451,ai9xph,"So far personally I have no candidate that I'm really favoring that heavily. But I have a few that I've written off, and she's one of them. "
16452,ai9xph,So you're saying that Donald Fucking Trump was an unstoppable juggernaut that no possible Dem candidate could have beaten? 
16453,ai9xph,"If you look at the state by state maps, it looks like Clinton mostly beat Bernie where Trump beat Clinton. Clinton’s strength against Bernie didn’t directly translate into a strength against Trump. 

Both Sanders and Clinton had plenty of support from women. Sanders got the 44 and younger voters by a huge margin while Clinton got the 45 and over crowd by a huge margin. The difference was based more on generation than just sex. 

https://qz.com/833003/election-2016-all-women-voted-overwhelmingly-for-clinton-except-the-white-ones/"
16454,ai9xph,The latter. 
16455,ai9xph,"I think the Democrats stand a great chance with a Harris-Beto ticket. I really wish I could sit down and talk with one of them, because I’d tell them one thing: if they reinforced their stances on income inequality, green energy and anti foreign interventionism by 

a) shut up about guns while campaigning. You’re not winning dem voters, you’re losing moderates when you talk about guns. Let that part sit until you’re in office. 

B) come out and talk about fiscal responsibility. I can’t even tell you how many Republicans I know that only vote republican because they’re concerned about the deficit and republicans actually talk about cutting spending. Even if they don’t do it, a dem candidate who said “we want to get more money into your pocket with wages, fix your roads and schools, oh, and we’re going to audit the government and eliminate waste to reduce the deficit and work towards a balanced budget” a Democrat would probably gouge 10 million Republican voters immediately. 

I’m a social lib who loves my country. I want everyone to prosper, but I don’t want a government who wastes my money, be it on social programs that don’t run well, or the military industrial complex. I think that most republicans feel the same way. Many of them don’t hate anyone, they’re just afraid that the Democrats want to take all their money and spend it on bullshit. I think we could correct that narrative and dominate the political sphere for decades. "
16456,ai9xph,"There are two different issues - being focused on climate change, and being inspiring enough to create a wave. 

Inslee checks #1 but not #2. You need both to implement the policies needed to address climate change. Doesn't matter how much Inslee cares about climate change if he's got a GOP Senate that blocks all his efforts, exactly like he's had in WA until last spring. 

IMO someone who is a bit weaker on 1 but has better 2 is the best way forward. And then let Inslee be Secretary of Energy or Interior or something. "
16457,ai9xph,I am a derp in the way I stated what I said. Kamala harris needs to be mitch mcconnell's position.
16458,ai9xph,"> The huge, untapped demographic is the 18-30 year olds. We need to find out what they want.

I keep hearing Democrats ask this question, but it’s already been answered many times. The Democratic Party just refuses to acknowledge what we want, while telling people like AOC to shut up and sit back down."
16459,ai9xph,"Well being in that demographic I will tell what gets me riled up. Environment, universal healthcare, and reversing citizens united. "
16460,ai9xph,[removed]
16461,ai9xph,"Yeah. They’re wrong about that.

You are black, Asian, Arab, and White, you tell me which is apart of you."
16462,ai9xph,Biracial. Or... a human.
16463,ai9xph,"The media attention matters a lot more early on than actual delegate counts, and if he gets 30% of the vote and the next highest gets 20% he doesn't need a winner-take-all to get the most delegates.

I'm not saying he'll win, I'm just saying he shouldn't be counted out. Personally I very much hope he doesn't win. I think ideally someone will come along and really just blow everyone away with charisma much in the way Obama did in 2008 and be able to unite all portions of the party behind them. Not sure who would be able to do that though. I have my eye on Beto, but we don't actually know how he'd do on a national stage, or even if he'll run, and he's definitely inexperienced compared to a lot of the others (although I'd argue that's an asset for winning since you don't have much baggage, but a hindrance for actually doing the job). "
16464,ai9xph,"What are you even talking about? The reason I said I liked Harris is because of her record and credentials. I don't care about her ethnicity or sex.

If it makes you feel better my other top candidates are Beto and Brown, who are both white men. "
16465,ai9xph,"Come on man, Obama is a brilliant person who always did what he thought was right.  I don't know where you were for 8 years, but we've seen 100x more chaos in 2 years than Obama's 8, he did a great job and if you expect perfection from every politician (or person) you're gonna be dissapointed.  Try and be reasonable "
16466,ai9xph,I'm saying that white supremacy appeals to more than you think.
16467,ai9xph,"Well trump won all the swing states so I can see how you can get confused. I mean Clinton won NY, FL, NC, GA, TX, CA, MA, SC, OH, and on and on and on. The biggest state Bernie won was MI and that was by like a half a percentage point. "
16468,ai9xph,"Obama was strong on 2 and better than average on 1, but even he wasn’t able to accomplish anything permanent or important. And he never even attempted a Carbon Tax. If Inslee puts all his political weight behind Climate Change like Obama did with health care, I think we’ve got a better chance at real change than if an inspirational leader only weakly fights Climate Change 

EDIT: typo"

16475,ai9xph,"IMO that Carbon Tax was flawed. I voted no on it and I KNOW we must do something soon.

Taxing them only passes the cost on to us. We need to force change in behaviors. Packaging needs to be environmentally friendly, etc... "

You mean in the general election, not in the primaries, right?

I did not vote for Hillary. I will vote for whoever wins the Dem primary. I will pick who I think will beat Trump, not who the Dems want during the Primary. 

I went to the state caucus last time. I may campaign to go to the national convention just because I could go and that would be exciting."
16477,ai9xph,I didn't CLAIM anything. Again you're putting words in my mouth. I was making an observation - people call someone black if they're half black and ignore their other half. Like the one drop rule tells you to do.
16478,ai9xph,"Again, you’re looking at everything in black and white, not saying the record was perfect but you’re acting like his administration did those things out of malice. They were by far the most liberal WH we’ve had and made tons of major progressive changes. Who knows all the reasoning that went those decisions. Maybe they regret some. But I do know they all worked their asses off and now we have Paris Agreement, more people insured and universal healthcare as a popular policy, a incredibly strong economy, and were working with allies around the world towards all sorts of reasonable resolutions to conflicts"
16479,ai9xph,"No, my point is rather that the same things we think make Trump absolutely unelectable, and a joke of a candidate, are the same things that make him appealing to a significant part of the electorate."
16480,ai9xph,"You can’t change anyone’s behavior without passing the price on to someone. This is economics 101. Consumer behavior will not change unless price changes.

16589,9w48mi,"Another famous President from France, Charles De Gaulle, made a similarly eloquent comment about patriotism and nationalism:

>Patriotism is when love of your own people comes first; nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.

16591,9w48mi,How can I vote for this guy?
16592,9w48mi,"what she's saying is only partly true - saying 'our interests first' **is used as an excuse** to **NOT DO** certain things, like: studying, caring for the planet. It's used as an excuse to do certain shady things like: grabbing pussy, building golf courses and unneeded infrastructure.

How much studying do dictators do anyhow? Every dictator expects other people to study and fix the planet.

'our interest first' basically implies, lets go kick somebody in the teeth and steal from him so we can goof off a little longer"
16593,9w48mi,Thus the key point: Trump has no moral values.

16595,9w48mi,"America never had the same backlash to nationalism that Europe had after WW1 or WW2. Nationalism powered the war effort in what, by the end of the second war, had become a righteous cause.

16601,9w48mi,"Wiser people than her have painted a clearer distinction between nationalism and patriotism. 

Patriotism is defensive. Protecting values, way of life, and opportunities. 

Nationalism is offensive. Forcing said way of life on others. Destroying what is seen as lesser countries and peoples. It seems to replace the world’s diversity with what it has placed on a pedestal. 



When you truly explore what George Orwell said, it actually isn’t as black and white in the set up and VERY obvious when looking back. For example if you say that your country and way of life are valuable and should be protected, that is patriotic and good. Now if you take that further and say that these other countries should have your way of life you start to get murkier. 
Are you talking about civil rights? Maybe you’d be right, but that justification forms the foundation of nation building in the Middle East that has gone so terrible since 2001. 

Are you imposing your way of life on other parts of the world?"
16602,9w48mi,[removed]
16603,9w48mi,"Yeah, I don't agree with that.  Patriotism is still a disgusting value that must be challenged.  No one should be proud of whichever imaginary lines they happened to be born within.  People should only be proud of their own accomplishment, and the USA certainly has nothing in that area to be proud of."
16604,9w48mi,"Nationalism is about protecting what is and what was. As perceived and remembered. 

Patriotism is about driving forward towards an idealistic ideal. Patriots are bound to no nation. "
16605,9w48mi,Not sure how the two conflict. Nationalism doesn't erase moral values.

Nowadays, a nationalist not something you want to be called."
16627,9w48mi,That's simply not true at all.
16628,9w48mi,The evidence suggests otherwise 
16629,9w48mi,"If you take the meaning of patriotism to be ""I cherish what my country, and my people stand for"" vs nationalism meaning ""my country and my nation are better than anyone else's"" then they wouldn't be in conflict if your country and people stood for alienating others, assuming dominance over other nations, and offered protection to only it's own people.

16632,9w48mi,"Nationalism is cancer.

16650,9w48mi,As a person from Ireland my connotations of the words are the opposite. Patriotism is blind loyalty and supporting your country in all its wars. Nationalism is support for independence but not necessarily supporting any one policy. So dont be so absolute about your definitions.
16651,9w48mi,"Forgot what sub I was in for a sec. you’re on the front page, btw. "
16652,9w48mi,I'm sure he means that it's better to care for all humans equally and abandon tribalism altogether. 
16653,9w48mi,I looked up that definition last month for an argument and it was definitely like that then.
16654,9w48mi,"By saying 'our interests first; who cares about the others?', we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it great, and what makes it essential — its moral values.""

Macron later warned that ""the old demons"" have resurfaced, declaring that ""giving into the fascination for withdrawal, isolationism, violence and domination would be a grave error"" for which future generations would hold them accountable.

It's convenient how you don't include the whole definition dotarder. This isn't your racist sewer the TD where you usually swim in shit. We aren't stupid knuckle draggers here:

By saying it’s “us” before “them” you are implying that “we” are more important than “they.” This goes against the basic moral principles of humanity.

Nationalism is also a very valuable tool for the few to direct the actions of the many by rallying them against a common enemy."

16673,9w48mi,Read a history book covering that time period. 
16674,9w48mi,"I would agree that is not universally applied one way, but it's certainly a problem when a powerful nation starts wielding it like it hasn't been used by powerful nations before for pretty heinous means.

In most cases ""nationalist"" has a more negative meaning than when it's a minority group seeking sovereignty from an oppressing nation or culture. 

Ask the Nazi party who marched on Europe, or the PRC who think Tibet would be better off as a territory of China. What about the Hui people of Western China who are quietly being interned by the PRC under nationalist pretenses. Let's not forget mid 19th century USA who was more than happy to use nationalist justification for effectively committing genocide against the native peoples of the USA.

In short, I wouldn't agree that nationalism is policy. It's a mindset that influences or justifies (usually) bad policies."

However the social distress he has caused in the past few months is not justified by that success. I believe it’s gotten to the point where he has done way more harm than good, and continues to grow more tyrannical every day. It’s hard because I feel strongly about beliefs from both mainstream parties. Being in this position you realize there’s shit bags on both sides, you just gotta pick who doesn’t smell the worst.

Edit: to answer your question more specifically, the vast majority of “Republicans” I know are social liberals. They support pro choice, gay marriage, etc. It usually comes down to gun laws, economic decisions, and immigration. So a lot of them are good people, just with different beliefs than democrats about what is “good” for the country (and how to create the most benefit for the most amount of people).

16752,61sh36,I think Harrison had a bad start 
16753,61sh36,[removed]
16754,61sh36,Given that Abraham Lincoln started his presidency with the Civil War its a best the second worst.
16755,61sh36,I don't know if i've lost faith in this country or if I've never realized how ignorant Americans can be 
16756,61sh36,[deleted]
16757,61sh36,[removed]
16758,61sh36,It was actually only 31 days. Also I'm pretty sure he was ill like 80% of the time he was president. So in terms of bad starts that's a pretty bad one. 
16759,61sh36,I often wonder how he would have done.  I suspect Trump is the only Republican who could have won the election.  Do you really see all those first-time voters in PA/MI/WI turning out for the Zodiac Killer?
16760,61sh36,"While this is probably true, he probably wouldn't have personally profited so much in such a small amount of time. "
16761,61sh36,"I think the ""winning"" he's actually succeeding in is: 

1) Getting the US Secret Service and City of NYC to pay him to protect and improve the security infrastructure at Trump Tower

2) Getting the taxpayers of our great nation to foot the bill for his brand building and golfing trips at Mar a Lago

3) Using his new even bigger platform to advertize his hotels and friends businesses on CSPAN etc

Having a position of leverage internationally to develop his hotels and other Trump branded businesses.

That's like - pretty much all he's been doing so far, so if you look at his real ambitions and drivers - and where he's investing his time... He's rocking it right now."
16762,61sh36,[removed]
16763,61sh36,He may want but they will only get embarrassed so many times before they strike back.
16764,61sh36,"If it didn't take so long to gather intel, I'd say he'd be out before the end of the year."
16765,61sh36,And that mentality will screw us over. The same way we all expected Hillary to win.
16766,61sh36,It's not going to happen as long as there's a republican controlled congress and a high approval rating of trump among republican voters. 
16767,61sh36,"Such a myopic point of view. People have been pointing out that Trump is malicious *and* incompetent since day 1. The immigration ban was the biggest evidence of that, not the healthcare bill. "
16768,61sh36,He has authorized multiple raid in the Yemen proxy war which destroyed hospitals and killed many children.
16769,61sh36,He's no Steve Bannon. 
16770,61sh36,Its not hyperbole 
16771,61sh36,"That's not hyperbole... there are only 45 of them, it isn't that hard to be the worst. "
16772,61sh36,Go back to TD  if you don't like hearing the truth. Trump is a failure. 
16773,61sh36,"I mean, Lincoln had a civil war in his first 100 days....but name a *modern* president who did worse."
16774,61sh36,"Explain your comment. 

Have you ever read /theDonald "
16775,61sh36,Civil War: not Abe's fault. This bullshit: all Donald's fault.
16776,61sh36,Why not both?
16777,61sh36,"Don't forget the sad state of all those in power, who seem to be very easily bought out, like our ~~state governor~~ senator of Oklahoma... who brought a goddamn snowball to court and said that disproves climate change...

Sigh."
16778,61sh36,"You r just realizing how many dont care about reason or creeds. Usually it falls on selfishness the moment you feel a bit neglected or unjustly treated. 

Democracy lives as long as people have time and energy for it. "
16779,61sh36,"I'm sorry, but you're an idiot. Hate for you to find out this way. "
16780,61sh36,"Obvious troll is obvious, but just for the record: 

Obama was a Senator (admittedly briefly) and legal scholar. 

He also had a plan which was implemented quickly: his administration was instrumental in the creation of the Recovery Act. 

He campaigned on a positive message, unlike Trump. Trump spewed and revels in hate. Some people hated Obama, but it is not at all the same thing."
16781,61sh36,"I think he was ill 100% of the time he was president because he got sick during his inauguration speech - on a rainy, cold day he refused to wear a jacket because he was a man's man. "
16782,61sh36,Still a better presidency than Trumps.
16783,61sh36,I see them voting for absolutely anyone that isn't Hillary Clinton. 
16784,61sh36,"I don't know if the people that live near Mar-a-lago have realized that, since presidents get lifetime Secret Service protection, they are going to have to put up with their small airports being closed and their businesses being screwed up every other weekend for like the next 20 years."
16785,61sh36,It's just as easy if you take it into account. Travel ban? Nope. Obamacare? Still the law. Build the wall? Nope. Lock her up? More likely to happen to him at this point. 
16786,61sh36,What has he done so far?
16787,61sh36,Please go on.  What has he done?
16788,61sh36,"but impeachment isn't based on popularity or public opinion, it's based on hard legal issues, a criminal matter. "
16789,61sh36,[removed]
16790,61sh36,"That was a Senator, not the governor, but Mary Fallin is not a prize either. "
16791,61sh36,Aw yes Hope and Change. What did we get? 
16792,61sh36,I thought rain and cold weren't supposed to actually influence getting sick
16793,61sh36,That's actually a common misconception. He died from a short illness he contacted about three weeks after his inauguration. So in reality my 80% estimate was off by about 50% in that he was ill for maybe 30% of his presidency.
16794,61sh36,Tippecanoe and illness too.
16795,61sh36,"In Harrison's short time in office he took presidential appointments very seriously. He refused to give people positions just because they were party members or just because they were important donors.

So yeah, even with only 31 days (and with 9 of those days being sick with the illness that killed him), he was a better president that Trump."
16796,61sh36,I think that's what people understate the most she is extremely hated by a lot of people and by both parties
16797,61sh36,He won't live another 10 is my bet
16798,61sh36,You have to admit that those losses are actually wins for the American people.
16799,61sh36,His only real win so far is getting rid of TPP. 
16800,61sh36,No it's based on the decision of congress. Don't underestimate the power of the Republicans to ignore shit.
16801,61sh36,"He has had no direct impact on the economy at this time, he has undermined our media, couldn't organize his own party to pass a Republican bill, failed at enacting his racist travel bans, and assembled the most inept cabinet ever. This has not been ""run of the mill"" for a new POTUS. "
16802,61sh36,"He hasn't *done* anything. His Wall and ICE expansion needs a budget from congress. All his executive orders are either toothless changes that either requires congressional funding, changing laws, or being tied up in legal battles. 


He's outsourced his legislative agenda to Paul Ryan and he hasn't even been able to unite his own party on his signature thing they campaigned on. His first Commander in Chief test would be considered 'mixed success' with even the most generous analysis and reports are that he's outsourced that job to the Pentagon as well. So his two major functions as the executive branch haven't been very good. In the mean time he's been plagued by scandals, unforced errors and maintains a very hostile relationship with the media.


Governing and political theater are two entirely different things. Trump is good at selling political theater to his supporters, but beyond that he hasn't had any real successes yet. "
16803,61sh36,Oops! Sorry for the mistitle. It's been a wild ride for our senators. Especially with Ralph Shortey.
16804,61sh36,They can lower your immune system though and make you more susceptible 
16805,61sh36,I think for cold and flus that is true. But for pneumonia I think that is how you get it. 
16806,61sh36,Thank you! Had no idea 
16807,61sh36,Do you have a source for that? Because I have been hearing that he died from his inaugural illness since forever.
16808,61sh36,Well of course she is. She was the victim of the most extensive smear campaign in history. People ate it up hook line and sinker. This was no accident.
16809,61sh36,"I agree completely. I forgot to add that Isis remain undefeated, which of course wasn't just another load of hot air, no sir...  

Also he may have shaved a couple of strokes off his golf game, and at a cost of $3m per round to the taxpayer, I think we can all agree that it's worth ever penny. "
16810,61sh36,"For the Chinese. They are loving it. If you were assuming it was so bad for arguments sake, why just give it up for nothing? Oh, well there is Kushner being in debt for billions to Chinese banks and then the sudden availability of 38 trademarks to Trump. And then he does want to renegotiate trouble areas of NAFTA but what's this?

16812,61sh36,This true.  The only thing he has done is to nominate Gorsuch.  Every other item of contention about Trump as president really hasn't impacted the citizenry.  There is just so much tied up in hyperbole and him tripping over his own dick that it seems like we've experienced 4 years in just the last 3 months. 
16813,61sh36,It says on Wikipedia that he likely died from drinking poop filled water that was at the White House at that time. You can see the links to actual sources from there.
16814,61sh36,"Of course it wasn't an accident. The years spent smearing her were clearly not spent in vain. The error by the DNC was to assume that she was such a strong candidate that she'd overcome the decades of bad publicity.

The DNC made an astounding, dumb fucking foundedly ignorant decision in nominating her for that reason. They hand raised a target that the RNC had been aiming at since Obama. Raise another one and they miss. They bult their entire machine to aim dead center on Hillary. Its just... a stunning lack of foresight. Period. 

Trump was an idiot from day one. He just never met opposition organized or *serious enough* to take him down, and that's fucking pathetic.

Fuck Republicans, btw. My criticisms offer you no quarter. You weaseled your way in and have been more of an embarrassment than I assumed you ever possibly could be. Hillary sucked. You guys fucking blow. "
16815,61sh36,"What amuses me is you call it an ""extensive smear campaign"" because in the end she wasn't indicted, yet if Trump is never indicted you will some how convince yourself it was political corruption that kept him from the court room and not a lack of real evidence because you are ""sure"" he colluded with Russia etc etc...


In reality, Trump has been accused of shit, Clinton was accused of shit....neither were/have been indicted for anything.

Mind you that doesn't touch how bad of a job he is doing but he was expected to do a bad job early, he has no experience.

"
16816,61sh36,Yeah. The stock market is bullshit and the bubble can pop at any time. Remember 2007? The market gets excited about Trump deregulating business practices which will help billionaires and screw over the middle class tax payers when they need bailed out. 
16817,61sh36,"I really, really hope all of you ""stock market is the economy"" Trump supporters continue to point to his leadership when we have a correction. "
16818,61sh36,Well that's surprising. I guess everyday's a school day.
16819,61sh36,Maybe once Trump bans all regulations and the EPA we will see a replay of this.  LOL..sigh 
16820,61sh36,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPJ9J-6vDw
16821,61sh36,"We are not talking about Trump here. Quit deflecting. Hillary was made out to be freaking satanic. It was a concerted conservative effort to do so. They did  it brilliantly. Their plan from the beginning was to split the democratic vote. They succeeded.

"
16822,61sh36,[removed]
16823,61sh36,"It will be Obama's fault.

The day after the election my Trump supporting brother pointed out that if the economy tanks it is because Obama had artificially inflated it. So, I ask him why had he been saying the economy was so terrible leading up to the election and his response was the economy is in terrible shape but that it looks really good now because Obama had essentially tricked everyone into thinking it was in good shape even though it wasn't and when Trump ""fixes it"" it will look like the economy has gone hell.

See? If it's bad it's because Obama made it bad, if it stays good it's because Trump fixed it before it broke.

Fucking clowns.

16824,61sh36,"Yea it had nothing to do with her repeated lying or the fact she created a server in the first place in order to avoid the FOIA

Everything is a vast right wing conspiracy, she did nothing wrong and stuff...plus they hate women and things"
16825,61sh36,What led to the crash was deregulation of the housing market by Bush which allowed banks to give subprime loans to under qualified people and sell these toxic mortgages to investors. But I'm sure you'll find a way to blame Obama. 
16826,61sh36,"I rest my case. You spit out the same things over and over straight from Breitbart.com. Yea Hillary is Satan..., bla bla bla. We get it."

16828,61sh36,"Breitbart?  Sensationalistic rag just like the huffington Post.  

I never said Hillary was satan, you are just dismissing any thing about Hillary that you don't like as ""breitbart bs"" yet you turn around and will believe everything said about Trump.

I don't believe the media when they talk about any politician because the media doesn't care about the truth they care about ad revenue and rage boners based on misleading headlines and partial truths create the largest rage boners.

PS, your behavior mirrors that of ""the_donald"" posters..."
16829,61sh36,Did she do anything wrong?
16830,61sh36,Take home message is the bubble can and will probably burst with Trumps promised deregulation and what looks like a great economy now will end in disaster and bailouts for rich people. 
16831,5q9y6f,"Why aren't the republicans yelling ""Big Government"" and ""Overreach"" at the top of their lungs?"
16832,5q9y6f,"Please be very clear on this; your government is censoring your scientists. Science doesn't have a political adjenda, and scientists are not out to get Drump. They're busy doing research projects and ignoring email. 

Within a week of him taking charge, he's cut funding, blacked out the media, dissolved all positive humanitarian and scientific goals, and is now censoring your scientists. They have not attacked him in any way, but their research and critical thinking, especially threatens his oil, coal, and energy complex. 97% of scientists are united behind the hypothesis that humans are driving climate change, and we want to stop it. That directly challenged Trumps regime, his policies, his promises (building that fucking wall is going to be awful for the environment too!), and his investments in dirty energy. 

When he forces them to adhere to this political screening, he's ensuring that only research that is beneficial for his goals will be published. 

TLDR: Fuck you trump. "

67% of Americans believe climate scientists should have the largest role in discussions about policy issues related to climate change. 61% believe Americans will need to make major changes within their lifetimes to address climate change. 48% say it's due to human activity, 31% say man made - but only 20% say there's no evidence it's happening at all. Probably the same 20% who voted for Trump.

"
16892,5q9y6f,"Pretty much.

""Fuck the future, I'll be dead by then anyway.  I want more money."""
16893,5q9y6f,Release it to the public if the public is paying for it.
16894,5q9y6f,I'm dumb. What's going on here?
16895,5q9y6f,It won't. But it's one of the many actions we should take.
16896,5q9y6f,Trump totally listens to the people and he definitely won't shut down this petition site
16897,5q9y6f,So doing something is the same as doing nothing?
16898,5q9y6f,"Maybe not. But it's worth trying isn't it?

And remember that the internet plays a big role on the public's opinion. We need to show support."
16899,5q9y6f,"Okay, but remember that the election was actually pretty close in those swing states. Arguably, if the Clinton team had done better outreach in those states or if she simply hadn't had the email server issue hanging over her head, the result would have been different. My point here is that there's a referendum 4 years from now and I don't think it will take too much to change the minds of not that many people, people that voted for Obama in the past. This stuff that Trump is doing simply makes that easier. Of course, it's up to Democrats in the meantime to build up that case and communicate it effectively. "
16900,5q9y6f,Ministry of Alternative Facts
16901,5q9y6f,I read it on the hill. The hill leans slightly more conservative but it's a very reputable news source compared to brietbart or Fox News ora the blaze. I'll never read any of those. The hills on par with wall st journal or the fiscal times. 
16902,5q9y6f,except that it is not just trump.  Many republicans have backed his anti-free-market moves and very few have voiced opposition. 
16903,5q9y6f,Just trump and the ones trying to ban gay marriage and the ones regulating bathroom use and the ones that started the Department of Homeland Security and the ones that signed the Patriot Act and the ones that sent us to war... 
16904,5q9y6f,Yeah they are. Republican is a synonym for hypocrite.
16905,5q9y6f,"No, most Americans think the global warming scam is horseshit.  And that's why the EPA was told to stfu until Trump can appoint qualified people to run it and control the liberal pseudoscience that keeps getting the majority of funding (under Obama).

You people simply found your new 21st century religion and BELIEVE everyone else is a heretic if they don't believe in your new god.  I guarantee you that my science background is much stronger than your's...yet, you certainly believe you are more credible than me.  The irony is killing us.

"
16906,5q9y6f,"It's fun that we can manipulate the data as we see fit. For example, using your numbers that you provided, you say 'only' 20% say their no evidence. Which is true, but I can spin it the other way, 51% of Americans believe that it ISN'T caused by Human activity. 

Funny how the opposing viewpoint is cut in half. Oh yeah, and your part about 31% saying man made? Total lie, they said 31% is natural. Here, I'll transcribe your own source since you can't read:

Beliefs about global climate change:
Due to human activity: 48%
Due to natural causes: 31%
No evidence: 20%

So yeah, the Majority of Americans do not believe in man-made climate change, it's called weather, and even with all our science we still can't tell if it is going to rain tomorrow.

And we know the percentage of people who voted for Trump, it's  46.7 percent. 

"
16907,5q9y6f,Obviously it doesn't belong to the orange tax evader.
16908,5q9y6f,Must not be that important. 
16909,5q9y6f,Mussolini hanging by his feet from a gas station after being beaten to death by angry Italians. 
16910,5q9y6f,No idea. Looks like my office.
16911,5q9y6f,"It's actually harming the cause it supports. People feel satisfied enough with this worthless action, that they don't feel the need to go out and do something that has an impact.    "
16912,5q9y6f,"It's going to be much harder. Trump is using all of his power to make sure he will win four years from now. They will pass a lot more laws making it harder to vote and will redraw district lines to ensure their people win. The key is getting out to vote, the rules practically sidelines all Democratic states. 

Its going to come down to if Trump can keep his promise to the mid west states. If he brings them jobs; then he'll win. They won't care how they got those jobs. "
16913,5q9y6f,"it is getting scary. A lot of the old guard has been cowed by now. I think only McCain is the last hold out. 

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/john-mccain-will-not-allow-torture-donald-trump-prisoner-of-war-james-mattis-mike-pompeo-a7546456.html

But....I know many conservative friends who don't like McCain anymore, and our Congress is losing all of their military vets."
16914,5q9y6f,"97% of scientists are telling us climate change is real and you're claiming it's pseudoscience? Who the fuck are you? You're saying you know more about science than hundreds of professionals who have dedicated their life's work to studying climate change? Fuck you. What do you do for a living so I can go to your job and pull this same bullshit on you? If you're so smart, why don't you quit your day job for whatever physically demanding job you work in (because you clearly can't hold down a role that relies purely on intellect) and become a scientist? Oh wait, you can't. That would require a post secondary degree in the sciences which you most definitely don't have. You're literally the poster child for being uneducated."
16915,5q9y6f,"What is the benefit of believing in climate change? Please tell me that. All other nations are switching from fossil fuels to renewables even though the oil companies collectively have been booming. How is climate change a religion? 
What is your science background? When was the last time you were in school, because every level, every school year since around middle school I've been taught about the effects and consequences of climate change. 

Also, why do you have to be rude and the EPA leader is a god damn oil executive, why do you believe he is the most qualified when his company and his beliefs directly undermine what the EPA is and does?

Also if you're going to get political and say this is Obama's baby or his pseudoscience I would like to inform you that the EPA was created under Richard Nixon. That was in the 70s when they began worrying about pollution and it's affects on humans and the environment. They clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites to prevent it getting into the water, and also they are just the ENFORCERS of the laws created by Congress... which if you haven't already noticed, has been completely in the hands of the Repubs during Obama and now. 

""Once a law is passed by Congress, EPA drafts regulations to clarify how to put it into effect. To ensure consistency and fairness, EPA also develops enforcement programs and uses policies and guidance to assist the regulated community to interpret and implement the regulations.""

CO2 emissions and the effects on the atmosphere is actually basic, straight forward chemistry. Are you saying that you believe Chemistry as a whole is a pseudoscience? I understand that fundamentally if you are right you are opposed to nearly everything Obama did. But he was not the person to make the government aware of what is going on and put the EPA in place.

China right now and many many other nations have rolled back their emissions and now IMO can and may have to step up and fill the US vacancy as a leader on this. This is Global crisis and when all other nations putting aside their dramatic differences and unite... it has to be fucking important and something that will effect man kind as a whole. Do you believe all of these people collecting data are literally making up the same numbers internationally?? Who benefits from this? Definitely not big oil, who has already funded many many campaigns to put doubt into American minds but the truth is we are killing our planet. "
16916,5q9y6f,"No, the percentage of total votes cast for Trump was 46.7%. That's 27.2% of the total population of eligible voters in the US. Hillary received 28.4%. 

I'm not manipulating the data, I laid it out clearly for you and linked directly to the study rather than to a news site with a political agenda. But more importantly, I couldn't give even one fuck about what percentage of regular people believe what. There is a 97% consensus about climate change in the scientific community - from the experts. 

I don't care what percentage of Americans think the sky is green, what percentage think the earth is flat, or what percentage think smoking doesn't cause cancer. 99% of Americans believing something false does not suddenly make it true. I was simply pointing out that your link was bullshit and that your figures were similarly bullshit."
16917,5q9y6f,"Your argument about not being able to predict the weather tomorrow doesn't make sense.  Tomorrow's weather is a short term prediction, where climate change is over long period of time.  It is more like investing in the stock market.  If i purchase a stock today, I have no idea if I will make or lose money on that stock tomorrow.  I do know that over a long enough period  of time, I will make money though.  "
16918,5q9y6f,"Who cares about what American's believe? 18 American Scientific Societies to list a few; American Geological Union, American Medical Association, American Meteorology Society, and American Chemical Society have all joined and made statements urging the public to act. These are EXPERTS in their field of research... 

If we forced every American to take a college level chemistry and/or biology course then maybe we could have an educated debate about what is going on. 

We used to have lead in our gas and oil companies paid and gagged scientists for years before the public was finally made aware. The ice caps are melting. The temperature is rising. The CO2 in the air is increasing rapidly. The oceans are acidifying. These are all known facts that have been cited internationally. There isn't really that much room for debate.. 

The lack of education in this country is clearly evident in the percent of deniers of this scientifically supported phenomenon. "
16919,5q9y6f,"I wouldn't exaggerate. If signing an online petitions satisfies you then you weren't very motivated in the first place.

And this is important. The internet plays a big role on the public's opinion."
16920,5q9y6f,McCain will fall in line. He's a paper tiger.
16921,5q9y6f,yeah McCain and Graham seem to be the ones continue to stand up for our allies and for American values 
16922,5q9y6f,"You seem very passionate about climate change and the impact it has, but do you lead a lifestyle consistent with that sentiment? Believing in something and not doing anything about is nearly as bad as not believing in it in the first place. "
16923,5q9y6f,"Economics and corruption.  When you learn to follow the money, you'll learn to see through bullshit like ""global warming"" or ""climate change"" or whatever idea is most likely to suck money out of your wallet and into the scammers'.  Honestly this is something that some people never figure out...just like there are plenty of adults who worship a skydaddy and give their money to scammers wearing fancy robes who tell interesting stories that make you feel good.  I don't know or care if you'll ever develop the intellect to see how widespread corruption really is...but at least you can't say you weren't warned.  Have a nice day.  "
16924,5q9y6f,"That's a tough line to swallow. I know he's on the other side of the aisle and is getting late in his years, but to call someone who survived horrible conditions;

http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/01/28/john-mccain-prisoner-of-war-a-first-person-account

He's not the type of person to fall in line"
16925,5q9y6f,Educating others in the hopes of changing some people's minds I feel does some justice. But I don't drive (own a car even) because I've been saving up for an electric but besides recycling and donating and reducing my use of plastics there's not much I can do since I'm not wealthy. But anyways... I still believe that climate change is different.. those who deny allow the government to be complacent and that's a much larger issue than individual complacency. 
16926,5q9y6f,"The thing is, when you do follow the money, you see how many politicians are back by big oil. How the Koch Brothers own and refine 25% of Canadian oil sands that is imported to the US. How Koch owns and controls Fox News (one of the major outlets against climate change) and how this propaganda is spread. I am following the money.. and the money is leading us to destroy our planet and deny factual and verifiable scientific data."
16927,5q9y6f,Let's not talk any more.  
16928,fra7fn,"Get enough PPE out, some tests and some ventilators out, Trump, and people might pay attention.  Right now you and Pence would be fired from any corporation or store's purchasing department."
16929,fra7fn,Governor Cuomo is also acting more like a president than Trump does.
16930,fra7fn,Trump should be impeached and imprisoned for limiting supplies to states based on who kisses his ass. Fuck the orange piece of shit.
16931,fra7fn,"The States are trying to buy but Trump is prohibiting it by buying it up, outbidding on purpose, so he can manipulate the blue states. And Trump is using your tax dollars."
16932,fra7fn,"He's a failure of a leader, who has responded far too late to the threat of the virus, spread misinformation, and behaved immaturely. He needs to be removed from office and ignored before he costs more lives. 
Trump is an idiot."
16933,fra7fn,Here in California  we recieved 170 ventilators.  All were broken. Silicon valley step forward and are repairing them. We recieved broken ones because we definitely arent a trump state
16934,fra7fn,"You know, Trump could get the attention he craves if he wanted to.  The virus all but handed him the election on a silver platter.  All he has to do is show leadership, release PPE and other supplies to all of the states (not just the ones he likes), bring on more pandemic experts, etc.

But he won't do that.  He'll just give PPE to whoever he wants, tell the rest to fend for themselves, and promote businesses that will benefit him directly, etc.  And that's why Gov. Cuomo is overshadowing him - Cuomo is showing leadership in a time of crisis while Trump is actively shirking responsibility."
16935,fra7fn,Start calling Cuomo the next Obama and watch Trump's head explode.
16936,fra7fn,Ah so THAT's why he started tweeting out about the number of viewers for his press conferences.  Going for the ol' one up on Cuomo.
16937,fra7fn,"King Fuckwit just dropped a bomb yesterday by suggesting that all of NYC and surrounding areas should put under strict quarantine.  Not because it would help the pandemic situation there, but because he hates Cuomo and wants to fuck New York over."
16938,fra7fn,"I wouldn’t listen to that lying windbag under any circumstance.  Inept, stupid, gaslighting piece of shit."
16939,fra7fn,"Cuomo is doing a really good job presenting facts and what is going on in NYC.  A better job than Trump.  People cannot believe a word trump says.  If you did your job and told the truth people might listen to you, but it’s too late for that."
16940,fra7fn,"What does it say about America that we couldn’t throw this megalomanic baby-man fool out of office? 
I’m so embarrassed to be American, but I’m not letting this puke discourage me from speaking out. 
Never give up! Never surrender!"
16941,fra7fn,well yeah people's lives are on the line. we want actual facts not a carnival show from a con man that we were stupid enough to elect president.
16942,fra7fn,"I don't need coco the presidential clown to tell me what's happening.

 I'd rather listen to someone who actually knows what's happening and is willing to tell us, rather than lies disinformation and plain racist statements.

trump should just piss off and play golf it's all he's good for."
16943,fra7fn,I guess it's tough for him to see a real leader taking action during this crisis.
16944,fra7fn,Ha ha this man is so petty and egotistical. Too had he's going to kill everyone or it might be funny.
16945,fra7fn,Because Cuomo has a brain
16946,fra7fn,Dump isn't a leader
16947,fra7fn,"It really is astounding how badly he's fucked this up, although completely expected given his personality. This is such an easy situation to deal with as the President because mostly you just have to listen to other people and say reassuring things, but he can't even manage to do that."
16948,fra7fn,"Good, keep doing them. They save lives."
16949,fra7fn,Typical. I hope he loses. The NYSD don't fuck around.
16950,fra7fn,This fucking piece of shit. A nuclear bomb could go off and he would still be thinking about himself and what attention he is getting.
16951,fra7fn,What an insecure cunt ....
16952,fra7fn,trump= egomaniac
16953,fra7fn,Nature abhors a vacuum.
16954,fra7fn,"My fantasy: at a press conference, Trump takes questions. A reporter asks: ""Mr. President, are you really that much of a baby?"" He refuses to answer. Asks another reporter, who says, ""Mr. President, are you really that much of a baby?"" He refuses again, or says some usual BS, than he picks one of his favored reporters, who asks the same question again, and so on. Over and over, reporter after reporter just doesn't let up. A kind of protest..."
16955,fra7fn,Good
16956,fra7fn,My pandemic not urs!!!!!
16957,fra7fn,"Trump probably goes to bed furious and wakes up furious. 

Other than that he’s made a dog’s breakfast out of this pandemic and the ones looking after the people are our Governors, like Cuomo. 

I think we all can rest assured that Trump would have never given a stay at home order. I can’t think of any prior modern presidents that wouldn’t have taken this seriously. Well... maybe Dubya, dunno. But even with him I think we would have a better than 50/50 chance that he would have provided leadership."
16958,fra7fn,"No he's not and no they aren't. Such fake news, yet you buy into it?"
16959,fra7fn,Wonder why6?
16960,fra7fn,Way to keep things in perspective.
16961,fra7fn,Who gives a royal fuck about Sniffles The Cl🤡wn anymore. Him and his adolescent tantrums. He’s a stone cold Adderall addict and he’s still Putin’s bitch so fuck him and his entire criminal family. 🤮
16962,fra7fn,Waiting for Trump to demand Cuomo pledge his loyalty to him for PPEs and ventilators.
16963,fra7fn,Sure.
16964,fra7fn,"I watched my first coronavirus task force press conference today. From what I saw, it consists of Trump talking about how great things are going, then he stands to the side and “holds court” while various people talk about some shit that isn’t newsworthy, while thanking Trump for his incredible leadership at least 2 times per person. It’s a total joke."
16965,fra7fn,"He just said 100,000 deaths would translate to  “a very good job” which means that people in the know in the govt are telling him 500,000 deaths is not out of the question.

It also confirms he truly does care more about his tv ratings than American lives."
16966,fra7fn,"His next move is ""CUOMO BAD GOVERNOR!  FAIL!  REPLACE!"".

Democrats across the whole ffking country need to RISE UP  and stop this narrative.  DO NOT GIVE HIM THE NARRATIVE."
16967,fra7fn,It's called leadership. No surprise Fredo doesn't recognize it.
16968,fra7fn,"Well, someone’s gotta lead"
16969,fra7fn,Good
16970,fra7fn,"He could always do something new, like be honest and be part of the solution instead of the problem but instead he wants praise for being a cunt. That only works at your rallies you door stop!"
16971,fra7fn,Off topic that chin is starting to look like the goblin creature from cats eye.
16972,fra7fn,No wonder Florida is getting supplies and New York isn’t.
16973,fra7fn,"Can someone enlighten me? I keep hearing Cuomo is trying to defund Medicare.  As much as he is handling this crisis pretty well,  is he really trying to take away Medicare from the ones who need it and why?"
16974,fra7fn,Good. Maybe it's time for a Twitter rant by the orange turd.
16975,fra7fn,"You are a kook Trump. Trump is really doing damage
now.  : \"
16976,fra7fn,Maybe say something truthful there orange maggot and your credibility might return but I really doubt it 😆

16982,fra7fn,“Trump is ‘furious with NY Gov. Cuomo because Trump is a little bitch” FTFY
16983,fra7fn,"Cuomo, the wartime president we need"
16984,fra7fn,"Stop trying to make cuomo happen. He's not going to happen. 

Neither is Biden, come to think of it. And Bernie's out, with a bunch of his supporters money, typical communist huh? 

Shit, you guys are screwed."
16985,fra7fn,Wait!  Did I miss one?
16986,fra7fn,"But.... The orange skidmark tweeted that his numbers are better than ""The Bachelor's""."
16987,fra7fn,"Because that’s what are president should be concerned about, anyone who might outshine him.

Dear Trump,
When it’s everybody else, it’s you.

-everyone else"
16988,fra7fn,Cuomo does look like the real president.
16989,fra7fn,And he’s got his stooge Peter Navarro in charge.
16990,fra7fn,Doesn't matter. Everyone thinks he's doing a great job because he's not insulting victims for being weak for getting sick. He could shit himself on camera and people would talk about how at least he didn't sling it into the fucking crowd. I'm done with this fucking country. If I survive the next few months I'm willing to take any paycut to move the fuck out of this redneck shithole.
16991,fra7fn,A CEO doing what he is would face criminal charges in addition to being fired.
16992,fra7fn,"It's not that hard right. Show you are in control instead of saying ""we got this"" while the world is dying.   

Trump out"
16993,fra7fn,You could say that about most anyone.
16994,fra7fn,"Yes, and If he would be running for president. More than likely He would win. It wouldn’t matter which party he belongs to. The man took charge."
16995,fra7fn,I’m pretty sure _I_ act more like a president than Trump does
16996,fra7fn,That’s not a high standard. Still Cuomo has done a poor job controlling the spread in NY. An absolute disgrace
16997,fra7fn,"What’s most disturbing is it’s behaviors like this as to why his supporters particularly like him. 

Trumps all about *punishing* liberal America. 

Doesn’t matter what he does as long as he’s “sticking it to the libs.”"
16998,fra7fn,Pretty similar to what he was already impeached for - withholding aid for personal benefit. Now he knows he can get away with it.
16999,fra7fn,He has blood on his hands now. His arrogance and ineptitude are killing people. He will forever be a stain on America’s history. He is an embarrassment to American ideals and the human race.
17000,fra7fn,[deleted]

You need skill, discipline, vision, and intelligence to do that, all things that Trump lacks."
17013,fra7fn,"Yes, but let's do it *because Cuomo is the best crisis leader we've got right now,* not just to pop the orange cork."
17014,fra7fn,"I thought you were kidding or being sarcastic.  I really did.  So I googled it.  WTF?  I know I shouldn't be surprised by any of this, but....wow.  Just wow."
17015,fra7fn,"Yah, too bad for him he doesn't have the authority to do it."
17016,fra7fn,Blame the republicans. There's more than enough shit to get rid of anyone else. I can't understand for the life of me how these lifelong politicians cave to this fucking conman.

17021,fra7fn,Do you have a better take on a perspective?
17022,fra7fn,Calling him Fredo is too good. More like the horse head’s.
17023,fra7fn,No and no. It would be political suicide for any pol.
17024,fra7fn,"I believe you're thinking of Medicaid, and I think he bought into the fake fiscal conservatism that always seems to hurt the people who need help the most."

These are the grandparents of the other 49 States (mostly looking at you NY/NJ). The running joke down here is that Desantis told all the NY/NJ elderly flying down here to self-quarantine and they’re all doing that on the golf course.  

As for the ventilators and other PPE resources, there are still honest and good Floridians down here that may need them. My elderly parents, born and raised in this State, haven’t left their home in 19 days. They’ve even had supplies shipped in. We’re not all fuckwits and degenerates down here."

It’s the same thing except trump conspired with a foreign government. But for historical reference when someone did something the same way in the past we took it and now name any scandal after that act. That’s what watergate was.

But it basically concluded that although star wars is a vast universe with unlimited storytelling possibilities the franchise is hamstrung by always having to have jedi vs sith, rebels vs empire, lightsabers and I'm sure there's a few others. Basically It's a huge universe but you have many of these key elements in every single movie or else it's not really star wars anymore making them all feel a bit similar. Star Wars movies containing a lot of the same elements wasn't a big deal when there were 6 movies released over the course of 30 years.

Edit: the feds are waiting to see wage growth, and have been since the recession to bring the interest rate back up to pre recession levels of around 6.5% which is considered healthy. I don't remember what it currently is after they raised it but I believe it's about 1.75%. This could be a disaster because we haven't experienced nearly any recovery and they already expect a larger market reset. No one has the assets to withstand it which will result in even more dire circumstances. Another thing to worry about is that the trading going on in the stock market right now is mostly corporate but backs, if the market crashes which it is projected it will, these corporations stand to lose and possibly they would lose their companies to bankruptcy."

Fortunately for our economy, the next recession will most likely not be worse than the last. The 2007-2009 recession was bad but made insanely worse as it also became a credit crisis. When GE can’t get day-to-day financing for their operations, you’re in a deep hole.

This recession will come as a result of the natural business cycle. People won’t be walking away from their mortgages at large and synthetic CDOs aren’t as widespread. Let alone banks not being able to trade for their own account. 

Make no mistake, we will likely be in a recession within about 18 months. But it will most definitely not be a historically impactful one."

17228,9lm4z7,"If you think we will be in a recession, that’s fair. I agree actually. Most bankers agree that there will be one around 2020. 

But to say the Fed hasn’t raised rates is ABSURD. They’ve raised rates multiple times this year (and Trump got mad about it). They’ve also said they plan on raising rates again this year and twice in 2019 (though that may change after today’s job report). 

Also, to say it will be worse than last time show an incredible lack of understanding of what happened in 2007.

He was better than Clinton, Kennedy and Truman. He was worse than Johnson, Carter and Roosevelt. Obama could have been great but ended up beeing above average. He had the chance to regulate wall street and making Obama care really great, but he didn't. That the American economy is doing well says nothing about living standards. Things are bad in the U.S., they where bad before Obama came to power, he didn't fix anything, he upheld status quo, Trump is making things worse. "
17234,9lm4z7,"Over 90% of all civilians were killed by Obama's drones?!  So almost everyone left alive on the planet is military personnel? And what does that say about Trump, considering his drones have killed more civilians than Obama's? I guess he's not a good guy either, huh?"
17235,9lm4z7," Those were surgical strikes. I guess you want to go back to carpet bombing, nice!"
17236,9lm4z7,"Yes it ""plummeted"" from 66% to 63%. About half of that is aging population skew from boomers retiring and the rest is probably still ripple effect from the recession.

Considering the historical high is 67%, we shouldn't exactly have expected 66% to last forever. With automation and an aging population we will probably see the number drop even further long term, and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
17237,9lm4z7,"I'm sure workforce participation has nothing to do, I mean absolutely nothing to do with old people retiring at rates faster than people turning of age to work. Nor the job creation today has anything to do with the 6 million job openings the day trump took office."

Trump is going to make shit way worse. What would be a minor recession will be turned upside down as trump doubles and triples down on even more trade restrictions to ""create more jobs"". Inflation will spike and trump will raise rates to counteract it. Hello stagflation. But the market will hate it and we will see massive drops as confidence bombs. "
17241,9lm4z7,Except they are predicting that the used car market is about to implode and it could have farther reaching consequences than the housing crash. Not an expert by any means but used car values and interest rates are insane. If it is less than 5 years old you are better off with a  new car
17242,9lm4z7,"A. They've raised rates but only very minor amounts. What its 2.8 now? That's way low historically speaking. What like 50 percent below the average of the prior 30 years before the 2008 recession? 

B. Trump will fuck shit up. He will over react. He will make over the top moves. He will cut trade a ton more and cause inflation and shortages. 

If you trust trump to handle a recession... well, lol... that's amazing. "
17243,9lm4z7,"I remember reading somewhere that suggested Trump mistimed his tax breaks in pursuit of a good headline, thereby pushing an anticipated “natural” recession back too far...essentially into the 2020 election cycle, instead of maybe a year or longer before the election. 

It made sense when I read it at the time. Utilizing the economic stimulus inherent to a tax break in a boom only extends the boom...but for only so long. The post-great recession economy he inherited from Obama, and extended via stimulus, can’t go on forever. "

17248,9lm4z7,"Used cars cost at most $20,000. Mortgages are 10x that, sometimes more.

The subprime mortgage market became problematic because the share of subprime mortgages shot up from about 8% historically to about 20% in two years. This is far from how auto loan market looks. 

Last year, $25 billion subprime auto loan ABS were issued. Compared to about $400 billion of MBS issued in 2005 and 2006. 

The loans are also fixed rate, not ARM so rising credit won’t affect existing loans like they did in the mortgage markets. Loans also fully mature in about 3 years versus 20 or 30 in the real estate market. 

This could hurt. It could result in write offs and drawdowns. It could shrink credit availability.

It won’t be as widespread as the mortgage crisis."
17249,9lm4z7,"That’s very true. Especially since the Fed will be shrinking it’s balance sheet, you can expect to see a huge spike in bond yields, taking money from the equities market and hurting the economy. What I think is very interesting is that you have a lot of bankers, investors, economists, etc. who have never experienced a normal slowing of the economy. It’s been since 2001 since we’ve seen a normal economic dip.

I think right now we’re seeing the sign of the economy slowing itself down. The timing of the next dip is just hard to predict just because of the effect of tax breaks (and repatriation of money), inexperienced investors possibly being overreactive, and seeing how the Fed wants to handle things like low unemployment but no real wage growth and a low labor force participation rate. 

I won’t credit any single president for an economy (good or bad) unless he nationalizes banks or something massive. But if the next dip happens in 2020 Republicans will see a HUGE hit. "

17251,9lm4z7,"ok - fair enough, I misread your post. However, for the record, people knew about the high civilian death rate from those drones under Obama - it's not like that was applauded. It was one of the things that Obama did that his fans don't agree with or support. But not a reason to ""break up with him"". And I'll also concede the Trump thing if what you say is true - usually the people who bring up Obama's drones are Trump acolytes who are misinformed."
17252,9lm4z7,"Ah yes, because your statement about labor participation ""plummeting"" wasn't completely misleading at all.

I haven't said a word about unemployment rate or what it means for the economy. I only corrected your mischaracterization. You're now responding by mischaracterizing what I said."

Fox, at the beginning of the Obama presidency, used one number for Bush and another for Obama. My point was that it’s really easy to manipulate statistics without context of how the data was measured and gathered. "
17266,9lm4z7,"> My point was that it’s really easy to manipulate statistics without context of how the data was measured and gathered.

My point is that the bureau of labor statistics hasn't changed how it measures the number from presidency to presidency, or at least not by much.  So even though there are disagreements about the actual figures, the systemic bias would be the same, meaning that you can directly compare the rate from year to year, or president to president.  

So if you just look at the published unemployment rate under Obama and under Trump, it tells an extremely simple story - the recession spiked it, but it was low when Obama left office, and now even lower under Trump.

I know that you're trying to provide nuance to the discussion, but it is entirely irrelevant here, because the published top line number is generated in a consistent way. "

It's called covid-19, because it was discovered in 2019. American intelligence knew about this in November. But Trump had defunded and destroyed the White House pandemic response team. 

When Trump was finally briefed on it he did nothing. He did nothing all the way up to the point where the stock market crashed because he was doing nothing about the pandemic. 

Germany had a good covid-19 test kit, and we could have bought some from them and started testing our own people. But, you can't have a high covid-19 death count if you don't have test kits, or the kits you have don't work. (Wink, wink ) so it's almost as though he was planning it, and the first test kits created by America didn't work, so now we're put several weeks further behind to March 3rd. And you know that's when they finally got the working test kids because that's where all the US covid-19 graphs start.

What's the official death count today? What's it something like a hundred seventeen  thousand dead? We know those numbers are way off because we didn't have any working test kits until early March. And now Donnie has decided we don't have to work on the virus anymore, and he started race riots to stop people looking at the real problem."

17352,hbfcjw,"I agree. It makes it very easy for people to be fed bullshit headlines from obviously right-wing biased “news” sources. You see people blindly sharing headlines from sources akin to “PatriotsDailyPost” or some other grossly jingoistic crap. 

People need to learn how to fact-check and cross-reference the materials that they read. If they did this, they would recognize that they’re being fed propaganda, not news."

17358,i9qirw,He should not be allowed to decide what bills to vote on. They should have to vote on anything that comes along.

17363,i9qirw,How can we help KY vote Amy in. Point me in the right direction.
17364,i9qirw,"I'm really hoping Dems take back the Senate, even if its just for the headline:

""Grim Reaper dies."""
17365,i9qirw,Vote Amy McGrath!  Spread the word!   Vote in person or drop off at the ballot box.  Don't rely on USPS which Trump sabatoged.

17368,i9qirw,"Republicans don't care.


Just like President Trump.


Democrats sent a bill in May 2020 to be approved. 


The Republicans never even looked at it and then waited until the last minute to try to put something together themselves without even looking at the plan that the Democrats sent forward. 


And then the Republicans had a lot of stuff in it that had nothing to do with Covid-19 or taking care of the American public. 


For instance? 


They put a clause in there to redo the FBI building across the street from President Trump's hotel. Because he was afraid if the FBI building was torn down, another hotel might go up and be competition for him. 


The FBI building was all slated to be rebuilt in the suburbs, which is something that had gone through years ago. 


President Trump and his Republican enablers stopped that. 


However? 


The Democrats put their foot down - hey you're not getting a couple of billion dollars for the FBI building when we already put money aside for the FBI building to be rebuilt in the suburbs. 


So that clause is no longer in there. 


But there's other stuff in there like that. For instance? Business lunches.


And then - food programs. 


$ 250,000 total for a food program for the USA. The Democrats put many millions in for the food program.


How can the Democrats and the Republicans come to an agreement when they are so far apart on the basic issues?


Its ridiculous."

Some might say he was good with Trump's executive order. What i say is that what the point of having you be paid all that money to not do yours?"
17375,i9qirw,"Enjoying your holiday Mitch? Sure hope so, maybe just stay away forever."

17382,i9qirw,Kentucky windchime should have a new meaning soon
17383,i9qirw,Evictions of brown and black people make it harder for them to vote.
17384,i9qirw,"And the funny thing about it which isn't so funny is that his backwood voters will still vote for this piece of shit. And that's the problem with these right-wing scumbag politicians they know that they have their right-wing voters in their pocketand all they need is a handful more to win an election so they don't give a fuck. That's why every Democrat, liberal, independent and sane Republicans need to get out and vote literally get out and vote and if youdon't feel safe going to vote you need to send in your mail-in ballot ASAP or as soon as you are allowed otherwise this election will be stolen from us ONCE AGAIN!! LET'S SHOW THEM WHAT A BLUE TSUNAMI IS ON NOVEMBER 3RD. 😷🌊☑️"
17385,i9qirw,"KENTUCKY VOTE HIM OUT FOR ALL OF US!!!

The rest of America thanks you!"
17386,i9qirw,Drag that punk bitches ass back in the chambers.
17387,i9qirw,"Is it true he makes $194k, $20M in the piggy bank, voted against raising the minimum wage 15 times, hasn’t allowed one of the 400+ bills on his desk to be debated in the Senate, hi jacks democracy for partisan reasons only, stacking our Federal courts with inexperienced yes men. Mitch represents the rot of this country. The cancer that’s eating us away.  You gotta feel for his daughters when they look at such a pathetic _____."
17388,i9qirw,But if his corporate overlords needed another bailout; McConnell would make sure that no one leaves for recess until the corporate overlords are pleased with the bailout
17389,i9qirw,I can’t see how this doesn’t hurt red states worse.
17390,i9qirw,Wouldn't this hit especially hard in Kentucky?
17391,i9qirw,"Mitch gonna crawl back to his hole once Trump kicks the bucket come 2021 January. Amy's probably not gonna win, but at least Mitch will not be able to do anything when Dems gain seats and block out his terrible bill pitches."
17392,i9qirw,His final bow
17393,i9qirw,I feel like this is another good reason to want term limits. Even if the same party constantly gets re-elected it forces a fresh face in every so often.
17394,i9qirw,Is it typical to adjourn for a month this time of year? Was this preplanned/prescheduled? What are the rules around this? Just curious...
17395,i9qirw,I think he wants Trump out. He is terrified of what will happen if he wins.
17396,i9qirw,This alone should make him lose his seat.
17397,i9qirw,It’s sad that the GOP leaders don’t even try to hide their corruption any more.
17398,i9qirw,We are just cockroaches to him.
17399,i9qirw,"You know, for a while I thought it was ridiculous that he’s just doing absolutely nothing but after carefully following how the GOP operates, I’ve realized that this is exactly how he’ll get re-elected. If you check the statistics, most people who are actually affected by this virus are POC and doing fuck all is gonna help his chances since their base is no longer hiding their racism, in fact, they think the virus is a good exercise to “silence science”."
17400,i9qirw,"Please stop blaming Mitch McConnell. It's ALL Senate Republicans who support this, and Mitch McConnell is just the one who volunteered to take the flak. He is there to protect the weaker ones like mine in Florida who were elected with razor slim margins.

I appreciate the metonymy as much as the next person, but I'm worried it lessens the point if we use it. The fact is that my Republican senators from Florida both support Mitch McConnell, and that means they support refusing to help Americans."
17401,i9qirw,And the right wingers are all blaming Pelosi. They sure do stick to the script.
17402,i9qirw,"Owning the libs forever!!! /s

Our system is seriously broken. They get paid their salary during this time, right?"
17403,i9qirw,Moscow probably

17405,i9qirw,McConnell is lower than dog crap in your shoe. Why can't the Senate just demote him and do their damned job?
17406,i9qirw,"Hey, he's OwNiNg dA LiBS though"
17407,i9qirw,Ditch Disgraced Moscow Mitch!
17408,i9qirw,Mitch only cares about getting re-elected
17409,i9qirw,Elections have consequences. This is a consequence of Democrats not showing up in 2016. Make sure you are registered. Do what you have to do. You got about a month and a half to get your shit together.

17415,i9qirw,"What about the House, they too are adjourned"
17416,i9qirw,What’s going on with the executive order for the extra 400?
17417,i9qirw,What's Pelosi doing? Schumer? AOC?
17418,i9qirw,"Didn’t Trump give $400/week by executive order though because Congress basically reached an impasse?

17419,i9qirw,[removed]
17420,i9qirw,"Yea wtf is this shit, the simple fact of passing the house should compel the next chamber to vote on it within 30 days."
17421,i9qirw,He’s been doing this for years. Remember when he wouldn’t bring Obama’s Supreme Court pick up for a vote before Obamas term ended? McConnell has stacks of bills languishing on his desk because he doesn’t want to bring them up for a vote. We will have Depression era style soup lines while McConnell and his complicit Republicans will be on vacation at their luxury estates. The plan is this will all be blamed on Congressional Democrats. They only care about reelection not the American people who are suffering.
17422,i9qirw,I think we need some kind of middle road -- the Senate should not be forced to debate and vote on anything the house passes. But it should take more than a 51-49 majority to completely block everything from even being discussed.
17423,i9qirw,"Let me tell you how the republicans would abuse that.  The republicans would pass nothing bill after nothing bill keeping people in session and winning through attrition by saying ""then pass this one we want. No?  Ok more nothing bills then.."".  We'd need some sort of precise verbiage to make that work it's be like a bill passing filibuster otherwise."
17424,i9qirw,Would the same go for the Supreme Court?
17425,i9qirw,"He doesn't really decide, its up to the GOP majority to support him. They could vote around his efforts"
17426,i9qirw,"We won’t he gets a free pass while thousands Will lose their house and go hungry, while McConnell swims in his money"
17427,i9qirw,Should try on r/conservative I am banned on three accounts so I cant
17428,i9qirw,Propaganda
17429,i9qirw,"Ironic that many Republicans think the unemployed are mooching while Mitch and Friends just take a whole month off. 

One month. 

Majority of Americans, if they even get vacation, get two weeks. *If* that.

If there is a nationwide pandemic or crisis they shouldn't get any vacation, this is absurd."
17430,i9qirw,"It's hard to convince our deep wooded citizens in KY that they're being used and abused, and we have lots of them. They all vote red even though it benefits them in almost no circumstances"
17431,i9qirw,"McGrath’s  ads need to say that in so many words. She’s now polling close to  Moscow Mitch, but her TV ads (so far) aren’t very effective."
17432,i9qirw,"Last time I looked at the numbers, it wasn’t good for Amy. Hopefully that’s changing since I’ve last looked. I live in a Cincinnati and they both run ads constantly on local tv. I think Mitch’s “Amy supports violent antifa and looting” message resonates with many KY voters."

17439,i9qirw,I think they go home in August to fund raise and plan their fall campaign. But they're also lazy. They get 3x the amt of vacation time that the average American gets.
17440,i9qirw,"It's contempt, not corruption."
17441,i9qirw,Moscow Mich has been actively screwing up the senate for over 10 years.
17442,i9qirw,The house passed the CARES Act three months ago.
17443,i9qirw,It's supposed to be per week.
17444,i9qirw,Damn if only house leadership had offered to meet republicans in the middle and cut a whole trillion dollars out of the bill in order to make a deal!
17445,i9qirw,They weren’t even willing to negotiate it’s a moot point. Half of the republicans were refusing to vote for any relief bill no matter how big or small.
17446,i9qirw,On the Supreme court it takes 4/9 judges to agree to hear a case. There should be some similar requirement for Congress so if 45% of Senators wanted a vote on the bill it would get one within a reasonable amount of time.
17447,i9qirw,Certain nominated justices also agree.
17448,i9qirw,Their addresses are public record. We can move in with them.
17449,i9qirw,And why should they not?
17450,i9qirw,"How about giving the Senate Minority Leader modest power to set the Senate schedule? Maybe the minority leader is entitled to 10% of bills debated on the floor. Majority leader can put forward 9 bills and minority leader would have the right to put forward 1. If the Senate chooses to immediately invoke cloture on the minority leader's bill, then that's how democracy works. If there is nothing scheduled on the floor, then the minority leader is allowed to bring bills to the floor at a certain rate per unscheduled hour."
17451,i9qirw,"I think no. Decisions made by the supreme court are powerful and them taking every case takes validity away from lower federal courts. Them choosing not to vote on something both reaffirms the importance of lower courts and gives the opportunity in the future to hear similar cases and not be tied to, and have to overturn, an existing ruling."
17452,i9qirw,"A caucus is not inherently a democracy. The nature and ethics of the leadership sets the tone for everything that follows. The vast majority of  Republican Senators are not fans of governance or democracy. The dynamics of each caucus varies tremendously and their product reflects that dynamic. 

McConnell is the King snake in a family of snakes.  They are all complicit but he embraces the role of being the lead torturer of the unwashed masses. In his/their world don't be born poor and or of color if you want to live a good life."
17453,i9qirw,"And frankly, horribly, I really hope it happens in KY and the other Red states. Im tired of these GOP fuckers not really suffering all the consequences of their election choices."

17464,i9qirw,All it takes is 51.
17465,i9qirw,"It's too easy for the House to gum things up in the Senate by passing useless bills (like the repeated ""repeal Obamacare"" bills)."
17466,i9qirw,"Agreed. With the SCOTUS, not taking a case means the lower court ruling is upheld.

The Senate not putting something which passed the House up for a vote isn’t analogous."
17467,i9qirw,"The red states ARE suffering,Alabama,Mississippi,Louisiana,Kentucky aren’t exactly exploding with opportunity,this fairytale that only Democratic led cities are failing is a false narrative,and don’t buy into the hate plenty of good Americans in these states votes get canceled out.For some it’s the illusion of abortion getting overturned,but for some it’s good ole racism"

Edit: Sorry if my previous statement was misleading. I didn't mean to imply that ""red"" states where some sort of paradise. But, from what I've seen, there is enough federal dollars pumped into them to keep them going (more than they put in i bet) and with their high concentration of idiots....the sliver lining to the dark cloud we are seeing is that those fools will have to suffer as well for a change.

(Which is laughable) She flipped on the Kavanaugh confirmation, describes herself as fiscally conservative, I mean where does it end? Running moderates in Kentucky has been a flop, and McGrath will probably flop too. Get the fuck out of la la land. Booker’s campaign did not hurt her, she’s just an opportunist who could not even win a seat in the House."

17489,i9qirw,"""If you think about why Kentuckians voted for Trump, they wanted to drain the swamp, and Trump said that he was going to do that,"" McGrath said during the announcement of her candidacy on MSNBC's Morning Joe.

""And you know what? Who stops them along the way? Who stops the president from doing these things? Mitch McConnell,"" she continued on MSNBC. ""And I think that that’s very important, and that’s going to be my message – the things that Kentuckians voted for Trump for are not being done. He’s not able to get it done because of Senator McConnell.""

McConnell was waiting for a president like Trump. They are two peas in a pod, and poising that as anything else is disingenuous.

17519,ihb4ln,"I honestly can’t believe how disgusting some of you people are. There’s video evidence completely countering the narrative that he went on a shooting spree. There’s multiple videos showing what happened, who he was, why he was there, and what happened after. Maybe you should wait until he has his day in court before pretending to be a legal expert. Jfc. 

You’re not going to convince anyone in the middle by assuming guilt before a trial. In fact, you’re going to lose the independents you should be convincing by playing partisan games."
17520,ihb4ln,Would it be considered justice to string this mf up?
17521,ihb4ln,"17 years old, wonder how that will play out."
17522,ihb4ln,[removed]
17523,ihb4ln,What video did you guys watch? Was pretty obvious it was self defense. Those rioters decided to fuck around and found out.

17528,ihb4ln,"While it was illegal for him to transport his illegal firearm across state lines, Trump can only pardon him on that crime. The murder is a state crime in Wisconsin.

And before someone claims the gun isn't illegal, in Illinois you have to be 21 to own a rifle. In (to my knowledge) every other state in America you have to be at least 18. He was too young to legally own the firearm.  


EDIT: As has been explained to me, I'm conflating the age to *purchase* a gun with the age to *own* a gun. His parents may have bought him the AR. Regardless, the point stands that he's not federally being charged with murder, so Trump can't pardon him for what the bigger issue here is - the man murdered 2 innocents."

17531,ihb4ln,Not sure this is accurate but I’m reading that his mother drove him to Kenosha.
17532,ihb4ln,He was literally a member of an armed right wing militia as a 17 yr old and enrolled in some junior cop program. Not a chance in hell those parents didn’t at last know something was up.
17533,ihb4ln,"I have a 17 year old and I concur.  However,  recently she lied to me about where she was.  It's not as easy as it looks."
17534,ihb4ln,Some states are passing laws to allow minors to obtain firearms without parent permission even. Fuck you very much Missouri.
17535,ihb4ln,"Lol, it was his daddy’s AR I’m sure. Probably shed a tear of pride as that little shitkicker left the house to kill “lefties.”"
17536,ihb4ln,Not at all. He's 17 and old enough to know what he was doing. Parents can't control at that point. He should be tried as an adult.
17537,ihb4ln,"Exactly, he’s a cold blooded murderer who needs to be treated as so"
17538,ihb4ln,I look at is as dark humor. Not hilarious. But funny in a certain way.
17539,ihb4ln,He's going to have a few decades of prison time to think about his life choices.
17540,ihb4ln,The joke is that he's being charged with homicide when he should be charged with terrorism as well.
17541,ihb4ln,He’s definitely going to become a George Zimmerman-type figure — a hero of the right
17542,ihb4ln,"So is Donald Trump, responsible for at least 150,000 dead Americans through his stalling, stealing, hoaxing, politicizing, and fumbling over the past seven months."
17543,ihb4ln,Mass murderer
17544,ihb4ln,Just a murderer this kid is a terrorist. Brainwashed by the #45ths ideology.
17545,ihb4ln,"I didn’t see it as a joke. The right wing is so off the rails, I wouldn’t be surprised if that happened. Remember that crazy rich couple with a semi and a pistol?!?!?! They were VIP speakers at the RNC."
17546,ihb4ln,It is terrifying that a 17 year old high school dropout who belongs to a radical right wing militia was allowed on the streets with an AR-15 ready to murder unarmed people.
17547,ihb4ln,He's a terrorist actually.
17548,ihb4ln,He is a bag of shit that needs to be flush down. Hope he does the patriot thing and walks the line like his presidents friend Epstein

17551,ihb4ln,"I agree that he is a murder, but he had a mob coming after him and they threw a Molotov cocktail at him, and so the shooting itself was arguably self defence.

Although he should not have been in possession of that illegal firearm and thus is a criminal and should be treated as such."
17552,ihb4ln,Yeah like your grandpa murdered the Nazis.
17553,ihb4ln,"Did you not even watch the videos? That was self-defense, clear as day"
17554,ihb4ln,"I mean he had bad intention but, you don’t see BLM out here getting tried for burning shit down."
17555,ihb4ln,[removed]
17556,ihb4ln,He was being attacked by multiple people one of whom had a gun. Dude handled his business.
17557,ihb4ln,Even worse he walked right through a line of police with a giant fuckin gun on him to get to the crowd
17558,ihb4ln,Because they just rolled past him in their armored vehicle looking for the black person shooting people.
17559,ihb4ln,I'm sure his skin color had nothing to do with it.
17560,ihb4ln,"From what I've seen, when he was running away from the people chasing him, he was running towards the police, presumably(?) to reach safety or turn himself in or whatever, but he tripped and that's when he killed a person chasing him. This is after he shot and killed someone else who appeared to be attacking him.

After he shot the second and third person he reached the police, but my guess is in the chaos, the police were confused. There were a lot of people with rifles in the protest so having a rifle doesn't mean anything, and there's a video of the police giving armed carriers a water bottle or something so they probably didn't see them as a threat at the time.

It is very strange to me that apparently he went home after that? But it's not really surprising by any means that the police didn't shoot him assuming they didn't see what happened."
17561,ihb4ln,"Oh oh, I can answer!!! It is because he is white."
17562,ihb4ln,He had his hands raised and was attempting to turn himself in. The cops told everyone to clear out. At one point he approached with his hands up and his back turned in a submissive stance. That’s likely it.
17563,ihb4ln,You sure 17 year olds are allowed to own guns?
17564,ihb4ln,"""He's a great patriot, a true American. Much better then those dirty Dems, ha maybe it was a Dem he took care of! Just kidding of course, I live all Americans but the Dems hate me I just don't get it. Anyways, this kid, he's a hero. I hope hundreds of others follow in his footsteps, in other Democrat ran cities. God bless America."""
17565,ihb4ln,"WHAT???, You don't want your business to get looted and destroyed by angry people because they are fighting racism. You should let do that because you clearly don't care about black people who are getting murdered by cops.

I smell boots hitler.

17566,ihb4ln,For defending his life from people attacking him with intention to execute him while he’s on the ground. Lol get fucked. He could represent himself in court and still get off on self defense.
17567,ihb4ln,"12 year old kids were fighting in the civil war and plenty younger were cogs in the machine. 

It's not hard to brainwash a human, regardless of age. It's a damn shame so many refuse to think for themselves."
17568,ihb4ln,They charges can beat easily. Fact is as mad it will make so many people. It was mostly justified.

17573,ihb4ln,"Nah. What we already know is that he shot someone, tripped, and then on the ground people tried to disarm him, and he shot two more."
17574,ihb4ln,"I read he shot someone in the head and that’s why he was being beat on. I didn’t read any further or fact check that though so, I can’t really make an assumption on the kid. Still, he put himself in a position that could fuck up his life for good, and that’s exactly what happened. Not super smart to bring an illegal gun to a riot."

17576,ihb4ln,"Too bad the people he murdered won't see their day in court. I've always disagreed with Republicans, but I honestly never thought I'd see this kind of concerted effort to defend the actions of a murderer. You're incredibly sick."

He's a sick piece of shit."
17578,ihb4ln,Counterpoint: Fuck you and any other apologist for right wing terrorists.
17579,ihb4ln,"It's not as if any of us will have any say in his trial or his inevitable conviction. The presumption of innocence is a legal matter, for judges and juries, not for the free-thinking courts of public discourse. Ironically, I am guessing you frequently claim to respect the freedom to speak freely."
17580,ihb4ln,"No because that’s not how you get justice, that’s how you start pointless murder again"
17581,ihb4ln,I think a life sentence will be fine.
17582,ihb4ln,"I was watching live streams, and there was a car at the stop sign. (At the time he had killed 1 of 2 people.) I know it's a very scary situation, but the best way in that situation is to hit him HARD with the car."
17583,ihb4ln,"So in your world an untrained kid can go 40 miles,  cross state lines,  deliberately put themselves in to a riot situaion,  incite violence,  and then claim ""self defense"".   good fucking luck with that.   That kid is fucked."
17584,ihb4ln,"He came here. It's not his ground and he CAME HERE and acted like it was. What did he expect? Praise and love from the BLM protesters? No. He's a 17 YO kid running around like he owns shit with a HUGE gun. It clearly seems fair for the protesters to feel threatened by this asshole. That's how America works nowadays though, scared ass people hiding behind their guns for self empowerment."
17585,ihb4ln,"In the video, he tells police he works for a business and is pointing towards it, which is in the complete opposite direction of all the shootings. Why was he that far away if he was defending it?"
17586,ihb4ln,No.
17587,ihb4ln,He drove across state lines and went into a riot. He obviously had fucking intent. WHY DO PEOPLE DEFEND THIS BS.
17588,ihb4ln,[removed]
17589,ihb4ln,Well that’s good.
17590,ihb4ln,Too young to purchase. In many states there is nothing wrong with a parent purchasing for them as a gift.
17591,ihb4ln,You’re wrong about age of ownership.  You’re confusing ownership with purchase.
17592,ihb4ln,"If you watch the clip, those “innocents” were charging him, about to curb-stomp him.  Kyle even waited until they were about to be on top of him before firing. The two he shot were closer than 7ft (the distance where knives and blunt objects are usually more effective than firearms).  In terms of self defense, the way Kyle waited actually put him in *more* danger of getting severely injured

And there is additional footage of him trying to provide medical help to protesters (he’s an EMT) before the situation in question occurred."
17593,ihb4ln,You’d be wrong. Amateur militia cosplayers and gun hobbyists who murder random people is a right wing obsession.
17594,ihb4ln,"It was illegal for him to have the firearm in the first place, so it is inherently illegal"
17595,ihb4ln,"But the open carry while 17 in Wisconsin is a crime, yet he was still able to walk around acting like he was trained for this sort of situation."
17596,ihb4ln,That’s literally not true. Every state has their own laws on this. In this case it was illegal since he was too young to legally own where he lived.
17597,ihb4ln,I read the same thing. Not sure I believe it either.
17598,ihb4ln,Let’s stop with this whole militia bullshit. It’s a gang. He’s a member of a gang.

17600,ihb4ln,"I have a 17 year old white son who fell into the Shapiro/right wing world for years so I know exactly how “not easy” it is. We’ve spent years in individual and family therapy, no guns in the house, exposing him to views and information to undo the manipulation. As a parent it’s on us!"
17601,ihb4ln,Idk I think it's different when you're kid is asking you to drop them off somewhere with protests and a fully loaded AR-15..
17602,ihb4ln,"Sadly, there probably going to frame it as mental issues, even though it’s murder."
17603,ihb4ln,"Agreed, he knew 100% what he was doing."
17604,ihb4ln,Brains aren’t even fully developed until 25 so this is literally the dumbest thing I’ve read. Thanks anyways.
17605,ihb4ln,Agreed. But let’s not act like if he doesn’t go to jail give it 4 years he’ll be at the next RNC.
17606,ihb4ln,Except he's a white kid and he'll be free due to self-defense argument.  I'm already seeing some posts are saying he's defending himself so the kill is justifiable or some bullshit argument like that.  How can self-defense kill 3 people?  I just don't get the right's argument ever.
17607,ihb4ln,"Hmmm...he's white, under 18, and in the upper mid-west. I'd say 12-18 months of juvie, at best, assuming the DA wants to prosecute at all. I'm already seeing lots of ""self defense"" arguments online. He's going to be a fundraising dream. 

It's not like he was a [person of color who accidentally voted while on probation in Texas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/30/texas-woman-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-voting-while-on-probation/) or anything horrible like that."
17608,ihb4ln,He’ll be very popular in the general population. Lots of close friends.
17609,ihb4ln,"I mean, generally speaking, there aren’t domestic terrorism laws (which isn’t so invalid).  In particular, there’s a good reason not to have domestic terrorism laws - they can be used (at least rhetorically) against peaceful protesters -and arguably no good reason to have it (since any act of domestic terror would naturally also break other laws for which a perpetrator could be punished and the judge administering the punishment should alter the punishment to fit the circumstances.  If there was a domestic terror law, Trump’s doj would try every anti-trump protester with it (alternatively for a more historical view, imagine the trial around the Chicago 7 with such a law around)."

17611,ihb4ln,What the FUCK is that
17612,ihb4ln,"I don’t think it’s clear. If anything the videos just show how complex this situation was. Yes, the kid should not have been there in the first place, especially with a gun. However, he was also chased by a mob (even before the first shooting). It’s a shitty situation all around. No one was in the right."
17613,ihb4ln,"An armed kid driving 30 to 40 miles across state lines to intentionally engage in a riot situation makes self defense a highly tenuous argument.   You can't deliberately incite violence, then kill people and claim self defense.  Just because your boy zimmerman got away with murder don't think all white murderers will get away with it."
17614,ihb4ln,"Why was he there with a rifle,in the first place ? If he wasn’t looking to do exactly what he did he wouldn’t have been there armed. How did he get away etc? Premeditated and planned."
17615,ihb4ln,[deleted]
17616,ihb4ln,I wonder what they would of done and if he had continued to shoot protesters behind the police
17617,ihb4ln,"The kid is built like an adult, and there were several people out there open carrying firearms, which is legal. It is now normal to see a mob of people chasing a guy around there. They were in armored vehicles and were preoccupied by talking to the other militia men."
17618,ihb4ln,According to video cops walked right past him and ignored him turning himself in
17619,ihb4ln,"I think the cops might have thought he was just another person standing in the way of the vehicles. If you watched earlier in the night, there was one guy who kept moving in front of the vehicles to keep them from moving."

17624,ihb4ln,">with intention to execute him

That's really really hypocritical. He put himself in that situation. He doesn't live here. What did he expect?"
17625,ihb4ln,They were trying to disarm him after he shot people.
17626,ihb4ln,"Wow, you're a disgusting liar. One guy chased him and threw a plastic bag at him, at which point he turned and shot the man in the head, he then fleed the scene and when he, AN ACTIVE FUCKING SHOOTER, was being subdued he opened fire and killed one more person while seriously injuring another."
17627,ihb4ln,Was he at a protest?
17628,ihb4ln,"He wasn’t being attacked by anyone. He had already shot someone, then he tripped, and then  the crowd still weren’t attacking him. They were trying to disarm him. If they had attacked him, they wouldn’t have been able to shoot two more people"
17629,ihb4ln,"I didn't want to bring that up but you're right. People are mad and they have that right to be. But right now we can't be saying this kid is a racist and wanted to kill someone. I don't think he ever wanted to. I think most people don't. All I'm asking is to gather all the evidence, then make you're judgement."
17630,ihb4ln,"The GOP has gone full fascist. This kid was a wannabe brownshirt, acting illegally but with the full support of the state."
17631,ihb4ln,"A.) not a republican 

B.) There’s multiple takes of him running away, being chased, then attacked. I’m waiting for the courts to clear up the story before I just assume. 

C.) Incredibly sick because I refuse to jump to conclusions? Jfc. You’re pathetic. People like you are exactly why innocent people get wrongful sentences."
17632,ihb4ln,So you would be alright with those rioters killing him. Or possibly just beating him an leaving him maimed for life? At what point does it become ok to defend yourself from bodily harm?
17633,ihb4ln,"I’ve heard worse from better.

Edit: 
Until he’s charged with terrorism, there’s zero proof showing he was a terrorist. That would be the people committing violence against entire cities to push their political agenda."
17634,ihb4ln,"Counter counter, fuck you and any other apologists for left wing terrorists."
17635,ihb4ln,Is it though
17636,ihb4ln,"“Incite violence”. You are actually delusional. I am not going to defend a 17 year old having an AR, but from every video angle available this kid was absolutely not the aggressor."

17641,ihb4ln,"Attempting to disarm a terrorist who just killed somebody is usually called ""heroism"".

Illegally brandishing a gun, pointing it at protesters, and shooting somebody is what caused this situation. You can't claim self defense when you caused the confrontation and were acting illegally."

17644,ihb4ln,He was also a member of a junior police cadet group. Also a gang.
17645,ihb4ln,"It's easier to call these pieces of shit a terrorist organization. 

Militia is such a primitive word on 2020. Especially in a country like America. What you have is a bunch of hate spewing racists who have been itching for this to happen for years. They don't want to protect their fellow Americans. They don't view their neighbors as Americans, but would rather call them communists. Disgusting."
17646,ihb4ln,A gang of terrorists.
17647,ihb4ln,"Terrorist group. 

Like the KKK, which still hasn’t been designated as such. 

A White Evangelical terrorist group."
17648,ihb4ln,He was in a junior Brownshirt police cadet program form kids as well. His social media was full of cop and gun worship stuff. His parents were fully aware of who he was.
17649,ihb4ln,"Oh trust me.  There were consequences for mine.  But my point was - maybe they didn't know where he'd gone because he deceived them. 

Best of luck to you.  That must be heartbreaking.  I'm sorry."

17651,ihb4ln,"As someone who has had had a psychotic break before and used to be a right winger, did your son do some illegal shit /have a mental health crisis or are you just making sure he goes to therapy because of his politics?"
17652,ihb4ln,Is it obvious yet that people like Shapiro have to die or at least go to jail for incitement.
17653,ihb4ln,You don't get that context from this meme.  Perhaps that's why they're problematic in general. I haven't read and news articles that they dropped him off anywhere yet.

17655,ihb4ln,"They throw black people in jail for years for killing under the age of 25, why not this guy?"
17656,ihb4ln,"Stop infantizing people so much.  This shit gets brought up when some 23 year old kills someone too.  

If at 17 you still don't understand shooting people is wrong then there is something seriously wrong with you."
17657,ihb4ln,He’s old enough to be tried as an adult. That’s all that matters.
17658,ihb4ln,He is old enough to know what he was doing.  If you think someone at that age doesn't know it's wrong to murder then you should read your own comment and consider it the dumbest thing you've ever read.  The government will enlist 17 year olds into the military.  He is old enough in the government's eye to know what he was doing and should be tried as an adult.
17659,ihb4ln,"His brain is developed enough to not murder people. He should be tried as an adult. Luckily it's Wisconsin, so he will be."
17660,ihb4ln,They throw black kids in jail all the time over less. Fuck outta here.
17661,ihb4ln,I'm 15 and I know that double murder is wrong.
17662,ihb4ln,"That is true, they brought out the couple who pulled guns on protesters"
17663,ihb4ln,Signing skittles bags just like his hero Zimmerman
17664,ihb4ln,There’s a chance he’ll be in the balcony for the next State of the Union.
17665,ihb4ln,"There is another comment pointing out a picture of the kid front row at a donald rally in Iowa.   So I would not be surprised to have him used in the current trump advertising screaming law and order and praising the kid for taking action against those ""thugs"".   It will play very well to donalds base."
17666,ihb4ln,"Agree, the RNC is a party that harbors violent extremists, criminals, and traitors at this point. That’s the sad reality."
17667,ihb4ln,Don't be ridiculous. He's on a multiple murder charge - he'll do 20 to life if he doesn't get the death penalty
17668,ihb4ln,...i mean...when the 3 people are attacking you?
17669,ihb4ln,5 years???  Wtf
17670,ihb4ln,Wow that article is infuriating.

17672,ihb4ln,This 100%
17673,ihb4ln,A display of right-wing ignorance.
17674,ihb4ln,"If you should ever encounter a crazed gunman, you should hope a mob takes him down, because the only thing worse than a crazed gunman is a crazed gunman enabled by bystander effect."
17675,ihb4ln,"Yeah the kid was absolutely irresponsible for being there and looking for trouble like that probably is a crime into itself, but I don’t think it’s a good idea to jump to conclusions here when it’s likely that this falls under self defense."
17676,ihb4ln,He had just as much of a right to be there as the protestors
17677,ihb4ln,"Whether you think he should have been there or not, it was his right to demonstrate. A man threw a brick and a Molotov cocktail at him as he fled, and then continued charging at Rittenhouse. If you ever let somebody who wants to kill you get too close to your gun, you’re asking to die. 

The other guy he shot had slammed a skateboard into his head, which is also a use of lethal force. Finally, the last guy, who got blasted in the arm, literally tried to shoot the kid in the head. Kyle Rittenhouse is completely innocent."
17678,ihb4ln,"I do very much agree he had no reason to be there after I learned he wasn't from the town it added some more dumbassness on his side of things. I understand he's underage an shouldn't have been out with a gun in the first place.. Yet all the video evidence that is out to the public right now shows him being attacked an running away from the first guy shot in the car-lot maybe we will get more to show why this guy started coming an throwing things at the kid.

As for him getting away there is gunshots going on all over in the blocks surrounding you can hear multiple shots in the videos. Toward the end of the last video I seen he was trying to get to the police to perhaps turn himself in but with everything going on the cops wanted to get to the injured I didn't see anyone else else up by the cop car with kid that could of told the police exactly what was happening an everyone an when they came up the street an got out to help the man shot in the arm no one told them the kids up the block at the light.

It also perpetrates the hate which will make it impossible for our cause to be heard
17691,ihb4ln,">  kid was absolutely not the aggressor.

And I obviously disagree.  Intentionally driving 30+ miles, as an armed white militia, just to deliberately join in a riot on the police side, while armed, makes it pretty clear he was looking for a confrontation, was looking for violence and was looking to incite violence.  He is the one who chose to go larping as a white power militia inciting violence.  He is 100% responsible for the murders he committed."
17692,ihb4ln,But they didn't murder multiple people...
17693,ihb4ln,At that point he had already shot someone in the head. They were trying to get the gun away from him.

17695,ihb4ln,"Community policing has nothing to do with guns. This is a conservative fetish. Your assumption that “policing” means “armed, untrained vigilante militia using force” proves how toxic the term policing and its culture has become. 

Learn about what you’re talked about before you troll yourself. 

“Defund the police"" is a slogan that supports divesting funds from police departments and reallocating them to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resources. Activists who use the phrase may do so with varying intentions; some seek modest reductions, while others argue for full defunding as a step toward the abolition of contemporary police services. Activists that support the defunding of police departments often argue that investing in community programs could provide a better crime deterrent for communities; funds will go directly toward addressing social issues, like poverty, homelessness, and mental disorders.[1][2] Police abolitionists call for replacing existing police forces with other systems of public safety, like housing, employment, community health, education, and other programs.

The violence isn’t limited to “protestors” as you call them, either.

But given we’ve seen cities establish curfews because of “mostly peaceful protests”, yes. Entire cities are suffering. Hope this helps.

The civil protests before dark are overwhelmingly more popular than the late night mayhem. The people of the city are hardly affected by any of this, and the only lives being affected are cops, who just shoot rounds and CS gas at people, to avoid harm.

""Bernie is too old! He would be a horrible president! He wouldn't finish his term!""

""Clinton is aging and deteriorating! Her temperament!""

This type of ageism and labeling it as something else entirely, ""political strategy,"" is one of the reasons why articles [like this](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/2158822/Elderly-Japanese-suicide-in-record-numebrs.html) pop up. The elderly in Japan feel like they are ""useless"" and, due to the communal and productive nature of Japanese culture, feel like they are a waste of space. This leads to Japan having one of the highest elderly suicide rates in the world. 

Moreover, if someone feels healthy enough and **is actually capable** of performing tasks, let them do so. People are more than tools to be used by a political apparatus. This type of political machine that some Democrats like to play is what resulted in Sanders being pushed aside for Clinton.

Hubris: excessive pride or self-confidence; arrogance

This false equivalence is a way of softening the obviously wrong side, we want to give credence to every part of an argument.

There are many key issues that republicans simply fall on the side of wrong on. Trickle down economics does not work, there is no historical example that bears out giving money to rich grows your economy/gdp (look at France’s gdp vs Russia’s). The dems are explicitly more invested in the middle class, and growing workers rights, which historically grows the economy and gdp. The dems also favor higher education, and free choice. These also have positive ramifications on the economy and working class. Let’s stop talking in the abstract, and start talking in practical real work examples. 

A strong middle class makes for a strong nation. When we had strong unions we were the most powerful nation on earth, but when you have computer science jobs people are dying to get into but can’t because they can’t afford the education, your economy is going to waste.

> Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Appeals Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett, has been part of a shadowy group that recruits like-minded people and seeks to impose strict, even extreme, control over those below them. The group is ultra-conservative and is well on its way to taking control of your sex life, your family life, your economic rights, your voting rights.

> I am not referring to any religious group -- attacks on Judge Barrett's religious affiliations are, in my opinion, unfair, unwarranted, and unwise. As a faithful Catholic myself, I defend Judge Barrett's right to belong to the ecumenical People of Praise and for that association to never be held against her.

> What I do hold against her is that she has been part of a different group -- one far more powerful than a religious organization: The Federalist Society. Barrett was a member from 2005-06 and 2014-17. She ended her membership when she joined the appeals court, but she continues to be a panelist and speaker at Federalist Society events.

> As Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) has said (and I have written in my book), The Federalist Society is more than a group of right-wing lawyers sucking up for clerkships and judicial jobs (though it is that). It is also, Whitehouse alleges, a ""vehicle for powerful interests, which seek not to simply 'reorder' the judiciary, but to acquire control of the judiciary to benefit their interests.""
Having studied the group, Whitehouse has concluded, ""The evidence is that the Federalist Society is funded by massive, secret contributions from corporate right-wing groups that have big agendas before the courts."" Citing reporting by the Washington Post, Whitehouse and fellow Senate Democrats Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) claim Federalist co-chair Leonard Leo, ""is at the heart of a network of more than two dozen right-wing nonprofit entities -- groups that raised over $250 million between 2014 and 2017 alone...to promote far-right policies and legal doctrines and the judicial nominees who advance them.""

18033,j9d34b,"I refer you to the words of the late George Carlin regarding the futility of term limits.

>“Now, there's one thing you might have noticed I don't complain about: politicians. Everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says they suck. Well, where do people think these politicians come from? They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality. They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses and American universities, and they are elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders. **Term limits ain't going to do any good; you're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans.** So, maybe, maybe, maybe, it's not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here... like, the public. Yeah, the public sucks. There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody: 'The Public Sucks. F\*ck Hope.”

Beyond being futile, they are also disastrously stupid. It takes a certain amount of time for a legislator to build up the network of contacts and learn the parliamentary rules to get anything done.  If you put term limits into the mix the only people who are going to know the rules and have the contacts are the lobbyists.  We do not want to make lobbyists any more powerful than they already are."
18034,j9d34b,"I agree that we need a changing of the guard, but limits should be a bit longer than president unless there is an effective way to remove senators mid cycle. I feel like a lot of what they do ‘should’ be influenced by their desire to be re-elected: this causes them to more closely represent the will of their constituents.

18065,j9d34b,"Kentucky and the Confederacy is...  complicated.

Kentucky passed a neutrality act early on - stopping short of secession but refusing to honor Lincoln's call for troops.  This didn't appease the legislators of the western part of the state, so they met in Bowling Green and formed a Confederate sympathizing legislature and seceded.

There were Kentucky regiments in both armies and they fought against each other at Shiloh and Vicksburg (and likely elsewhere).  The Confederate battle standard has 13 stars on it - for the 11 Confederate states, but also Kentucky and Missouri, who's illegitimate legislatures where recognized by the Confederates till the end of the war including their secession acts.

There is a saying I grew up with in Kentucky - Lexington is the southernmost ""northern"" city, and Louisville is the northernmost ""southern"" city. Seeing something like this photo in Louisville is not surprising in the least."
18066,j9d34b,It’s not Louisville electing Mitch. It’s rural Kentucky
18067,j9d34b,"As someone who was born in and raised in Louisville. You’re just wrong. You sound like someone who knows nothing about our city or the people who live in it. You didn’t even spell Breonna’s name right. Louisville is actually a pretty liberal city- especially by southern standards- regarding the populace. I’m not saying we don’t have our problems, breonnas case has highlighted a lot of the problems with our police department. Most of the problems with our cops Louisvillians were already aware of. Police corruption and racial profiling is by no means a distinctly southern thing. In fact, Louisville is one of three counties that consistently votes blue. So Louisville is not part of Kentucky’s problem, Louisville routinely tries to change Kentucky but we’re up against 117 other counties to make that change. Louisville has a deep history of racism but it’s relationship with the south and the confederacy is far more nuanced than you lead on. Most of the people I know in Louisville are disgusted with the confederate flag and the ideals of what the Republican Party has come to represent. It would do you well to learn more about our city. It’s got it’s problems, just like anywhere else, but to use our incidents of police brutality to somehow hogtie us to the “backwards south” leads me to think you forgot that George Floyd was in Minnesota and Kenosha is in Wisconsin. Racism in policing is a nationwide problem and your mentality is doing nothing to combat it. We, as a nation, can do better. Though our mayor is not holding the police accountable- and he’s a democrat- believe me, the people of Louisville won’t keep quiet until we see justice."

And you say it until you’re blue in the face because (1) it’s the truth and (2) it’s the message that leads logically to a wall being 100% unnecessary.

He’s relying on a dog whistle that “we need border security” rings in people’s ears as “more border security.” You reject the premise outright and control the conversation by introducing your own key point.

“Mr. President, we have border security already. What we need to ensure this government doesn’t shut down and we’ve come here today telling you we have the votes necessary for that.”"
18335,a5an14,Whatever dude. 
18336,a5an14,They don't need to.  They just advertise incessantly and pay to place content on Fox News.  
18337,a5an14,"Maybe.

Definitely divisive and didn’t win over *any* voters so ultimately destructive."
18338,a5an14,Huh. Other way. Corpdems pretend to care about actual issues when it suits their agenda. Otherwise why wait for actual progressives to say something first. 
18339,a5an14,Seems like you interpreted the statement incorrectly to me.

18345,a5an14,Which statement?
18346,a5an14,Unlikely considering I watched [this one.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AZtCfBR8ZZQ)
18347,a5an14,No he didn’t. He did say they have votes to get a CR but he also conceded the border security point earlier.
18348,a5an14,Ok
18349,a5an14,"Good job not staying on topic. And this is why, hopefully you will lose. You dont care about the issues you only care about labels, and ironically, your own ego and how you are perceived by others."

18352,9uzlb6,The big win is all the governors we just gained 
18353,9uzlb6,If you thought he was a lame duck while controlling every branch of government just you wait
18354,9uzlb6,Celebrate tonight but gear up for the next fight because 2020 will be a  true test. We have to keep enthusiasm going and young voters engaged. The house isn't nearly enough to turn the country around and with two more years of judicial nominations being rammed through you can bet its going to be a long one.
18355,9uzlb6,Let’s see those tax returns.
18356,9uzlb6,[removed]
18357,9uzlb6,"This doesn’t make up for the devastating Senate losses in Missouri, Florida, and Texas"
18358,9uzlb6,"It's great that we won, but the party has a bad habit of getting complacent really fast. I can already see Pelosi being used as a way to rile up the base for 2020 - a reason why she shouldn't be speaker this time around.  People who've been lifelong dems underestimate the utter hatred that the GOP base and even the hangers on have for Pelosi.  "
18359,9uzlb6,"I’m from Texas, and it was a big let down when Beto didn’t win the senate seat. I was impressed by how close of a race it was, though, and I’ll take any incremental win at this point! Progress is progress!"
18360,9uzlb6,It's Mueller time.
18361,9uzlb6,"The Democrats scored a HUGE victory last night taking back control of the House of Representatives. In fact, Democratic candidates received about 4 million more votes than the Republican candidates (about 9 points overall). That is a strong rebuke of Trump and his politics in Urban and Suburban districts. Democrats must show again what responsible leadership looks like. While I am not a member of the House and the Democratic leadership, I think their first priorities should be as follows:

1) Governmental Accountability and Ethics Reform - strong legislation to hold members and appointees to task for abusing the public trust.

2) A New Voting Rights Legislation - improve ballot network security, require paper trails, automatic audits of at least 10% of precincts, automatic recounts at 1% difference, ban with penalties misinformation about election details, penalties for voter suppress (like only putting 3 machines or broken machines in a majority-black precinct), penalties for machines than miscount votes (punish the manufacturer), prevent voter purges, ban robocalls, automatic voter registration at 18, and other good ideas.

3) Reinstate Net Neutrality, strength protections for pre-existing conditions, replace cost-sharing reductions to lower premiums, and I am sure that I am forgetting some major items.

Most importantly, Democrats will take over the leadership of Congressional Committees. No longer will the abuses of the Trump administration be covered up by the Legislative branch. There are certain things that should be investigated - like the response to Puerto Rico or the abuse against migrant children by taking them from their families. Let Mueller do his job and wait for his report. He already has a successful list of convictions, pleas and indictments."
18362,9uzlb6,Time to run an actual investigation of this criminal president. 
18363,9uzlb6,"Great, now lets get a leader whose first instinct isn't to capitulate to the GOP."
18364,9uzlb6,I wish I could afford a house... 
18365,9uzlb6,"As a new voter, what does this mean for us? "
18366,9uzlb6,Yay!! America!!
18367,9uzlb6,"Everyone knows they will never pass the Senate, but Dems need to show the American people what we’re about. Pass the following in this order: Medicare for All, $15 minimum wage, anti corruption legislation, and a Green New Deal. "
18368,9uzlb6,And now the deficit is all the Dems fault.
18369,9uzlb6,Lets enjoy today's victory...chipping away is what we need to do!
18370,9uzlb6,Gerrymandering time . Revenge from 2010.
18371,9uzlb6,"My priority list, not in any order:

Expand Medicaid, free school lunch, and did stamps to every American


Tax the rich at 1980 levels

Investigate the financial collapse

Investigate tax dodging by America's corporations

Throw people who exploit immigrant workers into prison and take their shit

Stop attacks on our American democratic institutions"
18372,9uzlb6,"Democrats would have won the Senate if they campaigned on justice reform, m4a, recreational weed, breaking up the telecom monopoly, etc. When will the donors let Nancy Pelosi stand up for these no-brainer issues?"

18376,9uzlb6,[removed]
18377,9uzlb6,"I think that GOP is perfectly fine with last night's outcome:

They get to keep Senate to confirm all super-conservative judges you want. Just look at Clarence Thomas resigning soon, to get something even worse than Kavanaugh on the bench. Also, they can confirm any Trump replacements in the cabinet (as it seems that he is about to fire generals... and Zinke)

They cannot get any _laws_ passed now, but that's fine -- they got tax cuts (which House cannot repeal either, because Senate will block it), and they are generally not interested in governing. They do not need any new laws passed. They can sabotage Obamacare without any actual repeal laws..."
18378,9uzlb6,Republicans are excited. Why? Because Congress went from doing nothing with them in charge to doing nothing with Democrats in charge. The only difference is in two years Republicans will be running against Democrats for driving up the deficits and getting nothing done. The short term memory of their supporters will allow them to get away with campaigning against two things they created themselves. 
18379,9uzlb6,now lets put trump in jail! but for real...
18380,9uzlb6,"As a Brazilian, I want to say congratulations! This is not only a win for the Democratic Party, but also for democracy as a whole. 😊"

18385,9uzlb6,But dems lost the night. I guess you have to take the small victories where you can get them

18395,9uzlb6,"FYI, I'm stealing this line."
18396,9uzlb6,I'm so sick of governmental gridlock being acceptable by both parties. We need compromise not two years of nothing. 
18397,9uzlb6,"You hit it on the head - need to keep youth engaged, and need to make it easier to vote.  Two and three hours lines at polling places is ridiculous. "
18398,9uzlb6,We also need to push for populist policies like single payer healthcare and the like. People won't be enthusiastic to vote in 2020 if we don't.

18401,9uzlb6,"As much as I would love to see that, it should be the last thing on our agenda. Independent voters don't give a fuck about tax returns. They want affordable healthcare, a livable wage, etc. We need the help of independent voters too if we're gonna win in 2020."
18402,9uzlb6,"Who cares ? 

He doesn’t have the money he says he did. 

His base doesn’t care.

18410,9uzlb6,Still got a lame duck congress to get through...
18411,9uzlb6,Sadly it seems that even if he is actively commiting treason the Senate will never impeach him and his base won't care as long as theyre sticking it to the liberals. 
18412,9uzlb6,[removed]
18413,9uzlb6,"Generally, it means a check on Trump's recklessness, and runaway Republican spending.

Specifically, it means the ability to have a *real* investigation (edit: from within Congress) into his administration's blatant corruption and his family's acts of treason."
18414,9uzlb6,"Reminds me of all those Obama v. Trump statistics infographics.

The only caveat is they compare each presidency when they're still very new. Obama was still in the shadow of Bush's recession and Trump riding the coattails of Obama's recovery."
18415,9uzlb6,No they wouldn’t. Missouri and rural Texas and northern Florida vote on abortion and Jesus. 
18416,9uzlb6,Winning seems unlikely. 50-50 tie could've happened with actual blue wave though.
18417,9uzlb6,No matter who they put up they will be hated and demonized. Look at it this way people already don't like her so dragging some other person through the mud would only give them more ammo then they have now. She's not popular but she's not dirty and she gets stuff done. I would rather see someone new as well but it's doubtful.
18418,9uzlb6,"Eventually, yes.  But ""next"" needs to be reining in the Trump administration and pushing back on the GOP.  And actually accomplishing the goals they were elected to pursue."
18419,9uzlb6,"I'm sure that's the consensus of your echo chamber,  but not only did 

Dems win the house, but they flipped several governorships as well.

18420,9uzlb6,Are you really so upset that you're going to other parties subs and talking shit?
18421,9uzlb6,"Florida hurt, Georgia was an emotional loss. "
18422,9uzlb6,[deleted]
18423,9uzlb6,"Well, Florida's going to have a brown wave in 2020 when 2 million convicted felons get to vote (mostly black and latino)."
18424,9uzlb6,"Agreed but the governorships will help going into 2020, will limit some of the GOPs ability to gerrymander and voter suppress. With races so tight it could be what pushes us over the edge "
18425,9uzlb6,"And a self serving tax cut for his owners, that's basically it. "
18426,9uzlb6,"Domestically: tax cut for the rich, take away healthcare for all but the rich, stoke racism and xenophobia. 

&#x200B;

Internationally - destabilize the west and the world overall, praise dictators.

Personally - steal all the money, get all the bribes, satisfy Vladimir

18427,9uzlb6,"People like him, and his supporters do not have any real vision for the country's future, except retaining their social and cultural relevancy."
18428,9uzlb6,"You're saying SCOTUS like it's a throwaway, though. With his two nominees put in place, I think we'll likely see a harder 5-4 vote.

Don't forget the fact that the R's played such insidious hardball with Obama's judicial picks that they left nearly 100 vacancies open. They basically stopped any confirmations in 2016, after slow playing previously.

I don't think Dems hammer the fact home enough that judicial seats are really crucial in having our guy pick the appointments.

&#x200B;"
18429,9uzlb6,Well honestly - the SCOTUS is a big fucking deal and will outlast about anything else he does.  
18430,9uzlb6,"Well there was also the border wall.

To echo a certain sentiment about health-care I don't really like MY tax dollars being used for something I don't consent to."
18431,9uzlb6,"Trump's goal was never about policy.  Bannon clearly articulated what this presidency's mission is:  ""Deconstruction of the administrative state"".  And Trump has been *wildly successful* on that front.  Every single federal department has had a critical loss of talented workers, experienced leaders, momentum, and strategy.

The very best example is one that's going to affect our nation for decades to come:  The State Department.

18435,9uzlb6,No compromises with Nazis.
18436,9uzlb6,Fuck that we need to bury these traitors
18437,9uzlb6,I have a feeling the majority of the youth will remain engaged. And there will be more to come as they turn 18. But YES we must keep them engaged! 
18438,9uzlb6,Not just that we need to push the right candidate for the right place. Don't be upset with Manchin when we can get our shit together enough to win by one or two votes. Let the blue dogs vote how they have to on some issues so they can be with is on these major ones. We can't keep coming close if we are going to fix things like voter suppression and gerrymandering.
18439,9uzlb6,"Trump can be impeached, but impeaching (in the House) needs to be confirmed by the Senate, which wont happen."
18440,9uzlb6,"To tack on, when the republicans impeached Clinton, it backfired on their political party. If democrats do decide to push to impeach Trump, it's better if it's a slow, methodical uphill climb, especially given how feverent some Trump supporters are. If we rush to impeach too quickly, we risk seeing a sea  of red in 2020."
18441,9uzlb6,"If it shows money laundering, or straight up tax evasion- I think most people would care."
18442,9uzlb6,"We can't pass any of those things, and wont be able to for the better part of a decade. People can and will run on that, but we can subpoena the tax returns now. ""Independent voters"" are not a monolithic voting group by any stretch."
18443,9uzlb6,"Crimes potentially? Its how they got al capone

18444,9uzlb6,You really think that is why we want to see his tax returns? To stamp out one fragment of his ego?
18445,9uzlb6,"Possible money laundering - would be a security risk - Also, if it turns out there is nothing there then we can move the fuck on."
18446,9uzlb6,I care. It’s sort of the principle of the matter. I. Can’t stand his tendency towards non-disclosure
18447,9uzlb6,Of course you should care. How has he financed himself without US banks? This goes to the heart of corruption. And what we learn may be disqualifying. It’s not only about his base...
18448,9uzlb6,"Last time Cruz won by 16 points. 

Last night he won by 4.  

That’s a victory. "
18449,9uzlb6,I agree- the fact that TEXAS was that close is a huge accomplishment.

18451,9uzlb6,You’re damn right about that
18452,9uzlb6,"Seriously. 

Trump’s approval rating is in the 40’s and that’s DIRECTLY BECAUSE CONGRESS REFUSED TO INVESTIGATE THAT. 

If we can cut 20% of that this party is toast forever. "
18453,9uzlb6,"The Senate is far, far more important. A loss there also means 6 years instead of 2."
18454,9uzlb6,She's earned it. The crap she's had to put up with for decades in ridiculous.

18543,9uzlb6,"Healthcare at a federal level would be exorbitantly cheaper, the main reason American health care spending is through the roof compared to other countries is how our insurance pools affect the price of premiums. If you know anything about the law of large numbers is that the larger your sample size the more trends normalize. What this means for healthcare is that if you have say 10 people under 1 insurance plan, and one year only 1 person has lots of medical expenses (say cancer), the price per person is incredibly high and the premiums for that group has to reflect that risk. On the other hand if you have a group of 100 than the premium will be much lower because there's much less risk that 10% of your pool will have exorbitant medical fees. Add in the fact that most people only get health insurance when they need it (so premiums obviously are higher since healthy [read: young] people often don't bother with health Insurance) obviously that's going to skew your pools to trend higher. In fact insurers did not want ACA passed because they were afraid that someone will just wait until they're sick and get insurance. The only reason they accepted it was because the individual mandate promised more young people would join pools and drive down premiums."

Trying to legally enter a country under a broken policy isn't the same thing as trying to enter illegally.

If Republicans have an issue with asylum law, they control the White House, the Senate, and the House, and have appointed a majority of justices on the Supreme Court. They could change the law.

Instead of changing the law, they've just changed policies. Now, asylum seekers are separated from their kids before the validity of their claim is determined. They get jailed before anyone even tries to determine whether they have a 'credible fear' of being persecuted back home. In jail, they are pressured to 'self-deport' to be reunited with their kids.

Even after the government has determined that their claims are legitimate (i.e. that they have a 'credible fear' of persecution), the asylum seekers will still be held in jail. All of this violates international law and domestic law.

If Republicans want to change how asylum seekers are processed, they can do so legally. Instead of trying to use the legislative process to change the law, they are deciding to flout the law and try their luck in court instead. That's worrying and wrong."
18587,8rux9t,"I think a more basic response to this thought is...so what? So what if they gamed the system and were granted asylum? What did you or I do to earn our rights? Just lucky enough to be born here? But somehow we earned a right to reject the desire of other humans that are just trying to participate in the world you and I are lucky enough to bitch about on Facebook and Reddit.

So now we have more legal ""asylum seekers"" so what? These are mostly honest people just looking for a place with opportunity. What would it take for you to flee your homeland with or for your family? That must mean they feel pretty strongly about what they can do here financially for their families or selves. The American dream if you will. Again, good thing you and I were born here!! Phew!

And yes maybe some game the system...but I live in SC and I see a great diversity at the Food Lion on benefits. A lot of that due to a high prevalence of teenage pregnancy, but let's not encourage birth control or sex education. And really what fraction of the federal budget is strained by this system abusing that couldn't be paid for many times over with securing appropriate taxes on major US corporation's profits? But no, let's just lower that corporate tax rate, even though it's not even the effective rate??? I'm not saying we should pay for illegal activities with American taxes, just calling out the hypocrisy. If you're mad about welfare, be mad about tax loopholes. Digressing....

So once any human steps foot into the states they are protected by the US Constitution. Some beauty in the document in that it says more about the laws of the land and less about the people everyone thinks it's here to protect. So anyway, if you love the Constitution and want to protect the second it seems odd you're not just as upset about this obvious violation of the 5th's due process. So what is it? Do you love the law of the Constitution or do you just love guns? I know you didn't mention the 2nd, just a general item that should be included...the royal ""you"".

So now we have the group that are just looking to sneak into the US. So they made it in, now there's two choices work or don't.  Illegal immigrants can work and get taxed. They don't get a social security number but they use a tax ID number and pay taxes. BUT they technically get less benefits than you or I cause they can't get unemployment and others we can get. So technically those folks pay a higher effective tax rate...a greater share if you will. But also consider they only don't pay taxes if their employer  pays them under the table to avoid paying taxes. Can the blame be distributed a bit? 

Then there's those who don't work. What percent are we down to here? Obama was dubbed the ""Deporter in Chief"" and sent back 2m I think I heard?? What percentage that made it over illegally and decided not to work or be violent translates to in actual people? I have no idea? Thousands? 100s of thousands? Even at 1m that's not even 1% of the US population. What is that doing to you personally? Police data has supported that illegal immigrants aren't more violent than citizens. But sure any crime, violent or not committed by an illegal immigrant feels a little worse, sure... but the anger the right shows towards those crimes might be more palatable, or seem less racist, if conservatives were just as angry about crime when it comes to homegrown terrorists like Adam Purinton, Roof, or Pulse. Shit if you look at Roof's motivations and actions and the timelines of racially based anger in America there sure seems to be a correlation. 

When you look at each of these components and strip them down it's challenging to figure out what anger towards this is based on other than rascism or fear. And some of us don't choose to live that way. There's more important shit to worry about that will directly impact your life and my life and generations forward."

Neither of those things are likely to happen when the Congress is so deadlocked. 

>Asylum is a protection granted to foreign nationals already in the United States or at the border who meet the international law definition of a “refugee.” The United Nations 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol define a refugee as a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her home country, and cannot obtain protection in that country, due to past persecution or a well-founded fear of being persecuted in the future “on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” Congress incorporated this definition into U.S. immigration law in the Refugee Act of 1980.

>As a signatory to the 1967 Protocol, and through U.S. immigration law, the United States has legal obligations to provide protection to those who qualify as refugees. The Refugee Act established two paths to obtain refugee status—either from abroad as a resettled refugee or in the United States as an asylum seeker.

But look at the post. It's directly implying that the quotes are discredited because the people being talked about are actually asylum seekers rather than illegal immigrants.

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would be ""What about..."" followed by an event in the Western world.

The term ""whataboutery"" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s or 1970s, while other historians state that during the Cold War, Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term.

18630,8rux9t,"Then you are here for dissenting opinion? So, you aren’t stuck in an echo chamber. "
18631,8rux9t,"The government killing it's own citizens isn't the only criteria for seeking asylum.  According to USCIS website, if you fear or have suffered persecution due to race, nationality, religion, or other factors, you are entitled to apply for asylum.

Whether or not that claim is accepted is a different matter, but it's ridiculous to tear apart families and have children living in tents because their family tried to apply for asylum."
18632,8rux9t,"Um there is an actual process for that. 
"
18633,8rux9t,"Again, quit your fucking bullshit. Trump changed the policy.


“The Trump administration has stepped up detention of asylum seekers (and immigrants, period). But because there are such strict limits on keeping children in immigration detention, it’s had to release most of the families it’s caught.

The government’s solution has been to prosecute larger numbers of immigrants for illegal entry — including, in a break from previous administrations, large numbers of asylum seekers. That allows the Trump administration to ship children off to ORR, rather than keeping them in immigration detention.”

18634,8rux9t,"Far better though far from perfect.
"
18635,8rux9t,"You already stated your position. I'm not going to waste my time trying to convince someone who thinks putting children into concentration camps is justified because Obama made ""empty promises."""
18636,8rux9t,"I have a plan, but it’s a real son of a bitch. "
18637,8rux9t,">I wasn't arguing the post, but rather the policy.  However, if I do want to argue the post, it states ""many"" and not ""most"".  

I don't understand why you are pointing out the word ""many"" to me when that was the entire point of my original comment.

>Many can mean just about any number so it's not really important. 

Except it does matter, or the point of the post is invalid. 

>The point is that people attempting to legally enter this country to seek asylum shouldn't have their families seperated.

The point is that without the numbers you have no idea whether it's a few isolated incidents or a widespread trend, but still somehow feel ok making ignorant generalizations about policy. "
18638,8rux9t,">No, no one said the facts don’t matter.

By asking why it matters you just showed that you don't think it does. Otherwise you would already know why it matters. 

>You are seeking a reason to dismiss the issue.

No I'm not. 

>Whether it is 10k or 20k, there was a process in place that trump changed and fucked it up.

Except it could be more. Or it could be less. And the numbers matter because they indicate how big the problem actually is. 

Without the numbers, you have no way of knowing whether or not you're making a mountain out of a molehill. 

>Anyone can apply for asylum anyways. So the number applying is irrelevant.
>
>What’s important is how they are legally processed. 
>

That's not the point of the post though. The post implies that the quotes are wrong because the people being talked about are asylum seekers. Unless the majority are asylum seekers rather than illegal immigrants, the quotes are still valid.

That's why the numbers matter - not for the legitimacy of the issue, but the validity of this post."
18639,8rux9t,"Calm down.

Again, this is a misdemeanor offense. 

Trump changed the policy.

18640,8rux9t,How many strawmen do you have?
18641,8rux9t,"So there are questions you cannot address against your view point?

His point is not malicious.  Discuss it, research it, address it.  It is a legitimate point.  Disregarding legitimate points against your opinion do not strengthen your position."
18642,8rux9t,"We need contrarians. If you can't defend your views, it's time to rethink them. Not ""you"" specifically, but generally. "
18643,8rux9t,"And it seems like the Trump administration is going through that process, finding most of these are false, and processing as required. "
18644,8rux9t,"Cool then you go do that research. 

That’s your project.

Report back here your findings.

Thanks so much. 
"
18645,8rux9t,Nah.
18646,8rux9t,"The issue isn't finding that the application is false, it's that they are separating families before those claims have been processed.

Even if the claim is denied, there is no need to separate the families, because at thay point they can be immediately deported, as a family, to either their home country or another country where they can seek asylum."
18647,8rux9t,"Yeah, that's not how it works, buddy.

I understand that you don't like feeling called out (even though I was honestly just asking for information) and so now you're trying to rile me up by being condescending towards me so you can then be dismissive and pretend I was being unreasonable the whole time.

The bottom line is that you are spreading political rhetoric with nothing to back it up. "

18654,jaqtbz,Texas set record numbers for voter turnout today! I'm so proud of my state and of people like you! Here's hoping it's enough for a blue wave!
18655,jaqtbz,These pictures are so wholesome lol
18656,jaqtbz,"Voter in Travis today. We seem to have broken our record, though there’s some messiness with some voting locations so it’s not clear by how much. My hometown Harris county fuckin shattered all kinds of records."
18657,jaqtbz,👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
18658,jaqtbz,Thanks for the encouragement and the smile! You rock!
18659,jaqtbz,Thank you. It's people who vote out trump who are the real patriots.
18660,jaqtbz,Thank you sister!
18661,jaqtbz,Silent majority.
18662,jaqtbz,Hey I’m Wichita Falls! Fancy seeing a neighbor here. I’m voting blue tomorrow!!
18663,jaqtbz,Lets goooo! Get that clown out!

18669,jaqtbz,"I believe the woman in the photo that voted for Joe Biden in Texas is a liberal Democrat and that's a site for sore eyes because we need all of you my liberal friends out there not just inTexas but also in the other 49 states and U.S territories to come out and vote blue and that means for Joe Biden and blue all down ballot. So I'm asking all Democrats, liberals, Independents and yes all sane Republicans who are sick and tired of this cult leader and the way he is running I should say ruining our country and he.who has ruined your party to come out and vote with all of us for Joe Biden. If you can please get out to the polls and vote(do not let anyone try to scare you out of voting if anything like this happens report them) but if you're worried about going to the polls due to the virus please get a ballot fill it out blue all down ballot and send it in ASAP. Remember if Drumpfs puppet Master Vladimir Putin and the Russians think they can take another election from us they're fucking dumber than Donald j Drumpf, we can still win the Senate and we have the house therefore we WILL do what the spineless cowards formerly known as Republicans were too scared to do and that is impeach and remove this demonic 👹 cult leader and send him back from where he came and that place is called hell👺👿 everyone be safe. 😷☑️🌊🌊"
18670,jaqtbz,Imagine if Texas and California both become blue. Then even the Republicans will be against the electoral college.
18671,jaqtbz,God bless you
18672,jaqtbz,Yay!!!!
18673,jaqtbz,There is no way there is 10k in burkburnett lol. It's way too small.  My daughter is still mad that the gas station by the highway closed down years ago. She said they had the best pizza there.

18699,jaqtbz,:) thanks!
18700,jaqtbz,I just heard the news! I think we are going to see high numbers all week. We cast our vote now we need to help others get their vote in.
18701,jaqtbz,"The patriots have a cause to vote for, voting someone out isnt really a good reason to vote. Its just not how it should be done, if its not on merit then Biden shouldnt win..so far he didnt show anything where he would be even remotely close let alone better than Trump, thats pretty sad if you ask me"
18702,jaqtbz,"Yeah, here you don't see a lot of Trump flags or signs. The ones you do see also have a Confederate flag. 
I've see even fewer Biden signs so who knows what the outcome will be in Wichita County."

18704,jaqtbz,Yes! Thanks for sharing  think a yeee-haw might be in order about now. I'm so proud of all those who turned out today.

18707,jaqtbz,California is blue already..
18708,jaqtbz,"Imagine if California passed the bill to make the state vote for whover wins the popular vote and then Trump wins the popular vote.. not saying I prefer his win (I do, Im about to earn 300€ from a bet on his win) but dont overdo it thinking youre going to win just because some talking head told you so."

18710,jaqtbz,"Houston and Dallas are the ones who deserve the respect. People are already standing in lines for hours.

18714,jaqtbz,Why is voting someone who’s damaging out any less valid of a reason?
18715,jaqtbz,Yeay I know. My mistake.
18716,jaqtbz,Nah I am just prefering popular vote over the electorial college.
18717,jaqtbz,Well that's good to hear! Been quite awhile since I've been there. Family that used to live there moved up to Geronimo so it's been years. Last time I went the fire station had a burger dinner charity event. Boy that was good.
18718,jaqtbz,"Well, I prefer the voting to not be mob rule.. you know the whole checks and balances thing"
18719,jaqtbz,"We moved up here 3 years ago and love it. We also got hooked on going to all the small town events like the charity events, rodeos and school competitions. It sounds so lame, but I love all that stuff now. Big hugs!"
18720,jaqtbz,"Do you think that countries like Germany or Austria who use proportional representation do not have any checks and balanaces? Even presidential democracies like France or Canada? 

Speaking of mob rule... what about the around 30% of republicans in California do you think they suffer under mob rule?"
18721,jaqtbz,"Yes they actually do suffer, maybe thats why theyre moving out in droves into texas and nevada..oh wait, everyone is running away from CA mostly to Texas, Nevada and Florida.. why would that be? Maybe because housing gets expensive when you raise taxes for home owners? None of the countries you named have unlimited free speech, right to effectively defend themselves and their rights, their private ownership rights arent respected either...so yes their systems suck, their checks and balances aparently arent good enough. Canada and France especially. 

Now this part is not political in a typical sense. If you are a citizen living in CA I urge you to read the text of Proposition 16 to repeal propostition 209... proposition 209 amended the state constitution to prohibit government institutions from discriminating and giving prefferential treatment based on race, sex or ethnicity. I beg you, vote against it.. have a nice day, sleep well, stay healthy and strong, peace."

18725,is75f2,"He has since posted an image of him with a mask on, and said it’s the patriotic thing to do. It may just be a coincidence that he waited until AFTER his failed attempt at a rally.

18745,is75f2,Other side speaking. The issue is not with statistics on voter fraud. It's with lost mail in general. While every report will state that it is hard to calculate exactly how much because lost mail is only based on claims made with the USPS. Most areas report 2 to 4.7%.

18766,is75f2,"Fair point. But honestly, it still feels disingenuous, if being argued by a Trump supporter. With the damage Trump and DeJoy have brought to the USPS, it’s not reasonable for them to complain about the possibility (however likely) of lost ballots.

It's a real shame Republicans manage to ignore their input so easily and largely fail to address these issues. It makes it really tough to believe that a concern for our election's security is an actual motivator here.


>If you can go to the supermarket you can vote

That just oversimplifies the matter so much, don't you think? Maybe it's just me, but I can't remember the last time I waited for an hour or more in a line that went out the door and into the parking lot while grocery shopping.

Foot traffic in a grocery store moves so much differently than lines for voting booths do. Lines to vote regularly get extremely long and that is without trying to implement social distancing.

The dangers of in-person voting during a pandemic are very real and shouldn't be overlooked so readily. I understand how people hear these persuasive lines like ""if you can go to the supermarket, you can go to vote"" in casual conversation and feel comfortable repeating them, but it pays to fully consider the hypothetical situation you're envisioning there.

And, more than anything, it pays to consider why and how our political leaders could have possibly overlooked that. It pays to consider that it was never overlooked at all."

18774,is75f2,">  it's like half the people that are hospitalized suffer long term affects and nobody cares about that. I do.

I have asthma and it severely impacts my daily life. I've learned, by trying to explain this to people, that most people are extremely ignorant to the importance of breathing.

18787,is75f2,"DPak is one really the only progressive voice I’ll tune into now. He is much more reasonable in his approach and politics to say, “Yes, I am progressive, and yes, I want progressive candidates to win because they will better represent what I think is best. If they do not win, I will still vote for the liberal because voting matters and I can more easily get them to see my viewpoint.”"
18788,is75f2,"Yes, that’s the point. When voter fraud happens, it’s found and corrected for. The idea that voter fraud will sway the election is built on it not being found or addressed."
18789,is75f2,"That's fair to say and I hear you there. But I do think it is worth noting the full headline there (with emphasis from me):

> Dr. Fauci: Voting In Person Will Be As Safe As Going To The Grocery Store, **If You Follow Guidelines**

And I think the two paragraphs of that article really do say it all (the emphasis is mine):

> Coronavirus task force chief Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an interview with National Geographic this week that in-person voting will be as safe as going to the grocery store as long as people follow posted safety guidelines. **He added that those who are at high risk or ""compromised physically"" should take advantage of normal absentee voting methods.**

> ""I think **if carefully done, according to the guidelines,** there's no reason that I can see why that not be the case. For example, you know, when you look at going to a grocery store now in many regions and counties and cities **that are doing it correctly**, they have X's every six or more feet. And it says, 'Don't leave this spot until the person in front of you left their spot.' And you can do that, **if** you go and wear a mask, **if** you observe the physical distancing, **and don't have a crowded situation**, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to do that,"" Dr. Fauci said.

That is just a whole lot of ""if""s, you know what I mean? And unfortunately the reality of our situation isn't advantageous for us here; because of mixed leadership and the politicization of a public health crisis, states all across the nation are marching to their own drum and doing their own thing. Even in states and cities that do enact some sort of social distancing policy, it often carries all the power of a stern suggestion. The federal government is fumbling constantly, local governments rarely enforce masks, and businesses often can't, don't, or won't enforce social distancing rules either.

On paper, in an ideal situation, we could maybe pull off in-person voting with a lot of effort and planning. Unfortunately, nothing about the reality before us aligns with that.

And none of this is even touching recent findings that indicate COVID *is* airborne afterall. If and when that's shown to be true, then all of this is invalidated. There is no feasible way to setup safe voting stations for folks if sharing the same air is all it takes. It would be one thing if it was a short period, maybe 20 minutes max, but it's far too common for people to spend entire afternoons and evenings waiting in line to vote. 6 feet and a mask, even if those could be guaranteed, just wouldn't be enough."
18790,is75f2,Thanks for the clarification.  I look forward to learning more about the IFR when testing practices are up to a standard that will allow for reliable calculations.
18791,is75f2,"You didn’t convey “‘6%’ doesn’t actually mean anything....”

How old are you? Fifteen?"
18792,is75f2,So you’re not a native English speaker.
18793,is75f2,"Yeah he’s really serious on voting. I currently can’t vote since I’m too young, but I know how important it is"
18794,is75f2,"That’s exactly why I like DPak. If progressive candidates don’t make it, voting for liberal candidates will make it be possible. Look at Joe Biden...he willingly inherited some of bernies policies, like free college. That’s getting a step closer to a progressive candidate."
18795,is75f2,I hardly count a do-over corrected. Imagine having to do something as expansive as a presidential election a second time. You can’t blame the republicans for being suspicious.  Especially with the USPS Union endorsing Biden.
18796,is75f2,"Sure seems like you’re the only one having trouble getting the points we’re making here. Not sure I’d be so loudly, confidently wrong about criticizing others’ English ability when you’re not such a hotshot at it."
18797,is75f2,"Ok. Let’s go again. 6% of Covid deaths are directly from Covid. As in, the virus so thoroughly tearing apart the lungs that they cannot function anymore, leading to the infected individual’s death.

94% of them are from Covid complications. These come from other Covid symptoms like pneumonia, or Covid making an underlying condition deadly.

Take asthma. The combination of the toll Covid takes on your breathing, combined with the toll the underlying asthma does, people may not be able to breath and therefore die. 

They died of Covid complications. While the asthma was there before, the asthma wouldn’t have killed them without the severe Covid symptoms. Meaning that it’s a death from Covid.

So, in 100% of Covid deaths, Covid was the biggest factor in their deaths, whether all alone, influencing other underlying conditions, or bringing other diseases. 

Please look into things and think about them before you speak on them like you’re an expert. It makes you look like a dumbass. 

And don’t ask a condescending question while saying something completely idiotic, since it makes you look like a jerk.

So anyways, how old are you? Seven?"
18798,is75f2,Oh I absolutely am. But I figured I’d address your actual concern - your issues understanding my pretty clear comment - rather than get into when I learned English.
18799,is75f2,"I’m glad you’re serious about voting! The 2016 election was the first election I was old enough to vote in, and boy do I wish more people my age had voted in that one…"
18800,is75f2,"Thank god, my generation is so stupid with exercising their most basic political rights.  I'm hopeful the younger generation is going to be more civic-minded due to coming of age during all this craziness."
18801,is75f2,"When basically the entire west coast votes by mail every election, you’d think there would be more cases of fraud if it were actually an issue, no?"
18802,is75f2,Are there any other documented cases of fraud besides Paterson?
18803,is75f2,wat
18804,is75f2,Oh. You’re spreading that nonsense. No wonder why you come across like you’re 15. But at least you were able to convey the information this time. I’ll give you that.
18805,is75f2,[removed]
18806,is75f2,"I’d hardly call it the entire west coast. There is information from the Secretary of State on it. While it is true around 67% of voters in California vote by mail, it’s not a huge amount considering most people don’t vote. This year 6,982,750 of the 9,687,076 people who voted in the primary did so by mail. These are absentee ballots requiring voter authentication and ID for approval. The total goes drastically down during election years. On average 48% of voters do so by absentee during presidential elections. I’m fine with absentee ballots, but this universal mail is going to muddy the waters. Especially when you consider in two other primaries so far, 1 in 5 was invalidated."
18807,is75f2,"Yeah there were absentee ballots for the state of south Caroline that ended up in Maryland. NYCs primary was drawn out so long because one in every 5 were invalidated, whether fraud or improperly filed out, that is quite concerning to think your vote could just be cast out without you knowing. And their primary was June 23rd. There was people caught in West Virginia, philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas."
18808,is75f2,"So you won’t refute this claim and instead think that telling someone that they come across as 15 is an insult? I see how it is. You won’t take facts and just sit in denial of everything, because it suits your narrative.

No wonder you come across as seven."
18809,is75f2,"What you call disinformation, I’ll call an accurate understanding of how deaths are recorded. 

Again, please feel free to point out which parts you feel aren’t clearly communicated and I’ll rephrase!"
18810,is75f2,"Washington, Oregon, and California all conduct a majority of each election through the mail. Acting like that doesn’t count because it isn’t the entirety of their voting is arguing in bad faith."
18811,is75f2,"The “claim” doesn’t even have a source. But Dr. Fauci has already corrected you on these disinformations. 

Sorry, kid. Maybe one day you’ll get a clue. lol"
18812,is75f2,Considering you’re spreading disinformation I’m not surprised you’d call it that.
18813,is75f2,Do you think idiots understand English?
18814,is75f2,That’s not my argument at all. My point is those are all absentee ballots. People request them. That’s why it works.

It’s remarkable the similarities this has with the Catholic priest sex abuse scandal; zero accountability, bad priests/cops moving around to different places, hundreds of thousands of victims, etc."
18822,gyam1g,"I agree, but also fuck Steven Crowder."
18823,gyam1g,I used the police to police the police
18824,gyam1g,"All fatalities caused by law enforcement should be investigated by ~~the fbi~~ an independent state level commission consisting of forensic experts, coroners, legal experts, and community and police advocates (so everyone feels involved but police are way outnumbered and can’t override the facts).

They can be paid out of the pensions of guilty officers and 100% of the existing budget for military grade equipment."
18825,gyam1g,"Watching Canadian TV, I've often wondered if mandatory coroner's inquests would be helpful."

18832,gyam1g,"That's a start. However, given the state of our justice department, the question becomes how we ensure that the FBI is led with integrity. We need a process of selecting the head of the Justice Department that eliminates extreme and partisan candidates, then allows the most qualified candidates to rise to the top. This also has to be done in such a way that the final candidate has no allegiance to any one individual. The process we have today is literally the exact opposite of what we need."
18833,gyam1g,But then who investigates the FBI /s
18834,gyam1g,Should be automatic grand jury.  Homicide under color of law should be *presumed* criminal until some kind of impartial review declines to charge it.
18835,gyam1g,"It won't matter unless you require some kind of action. And as you can see  today in  2020, If the wrong person is in charge the FBI simply won't do it!"

18837,gyam1g,"Who does it if the FBI was involved? Not against the idea it’s a really good one, just that last part."
18838,gyam1g,Barr. Attorney General Barr is the reason why we shouldn’t do this until January of 2021 (hopefully).

18857,gyam1g,But...her emails!
18858,gyam1g,Exactly. The FBI is still law enforcement and they have a conflict of interest. Any review board needs to be separated from law enforcement.

I'm saying that there is an easy way to hold police accountable. 

Officers are suspended pending an investigation after every shoot. If their camera isn't running, they don't get paid during that suspension. 

If they are the subject of an excessive force or other complaint of physical abuse, and they don't have a camera running, it's an automatic two week suspension without pay.

Tie their cameras to their paychecks, and they'll start using them."

18871,gyam1g,I don't feel like the FBI is the same kind of organization that it was 50 years ago. And they have very little motivation to protect local law enforcement organizations from public ridicule. I think FBI agents tend to view state and local police with the same disdain state and local law enforcement have for the general public.

The members of the review board are already going to be bombarded by lobbying and  propaganda from the police union and local departments, adding any significant amount of law enforcement to the board would just allow them to keep doing what they already do which is ""investigate themselves and find no wrong doing"""

It attempts to shore up a gap in the legal system where conflicts of interest too often prevent those who work in the system from having to abide by the rules of the system.

If you have 9 people investigating the mob, would it be reasonable to have 2 mobsters on the panel with them? No. 

You don’t include people who can’t be trusted to put aside their own personal connections to a case on the team investigating the case, just like you don’t put people on a jury if they can’t be impartial. I agree that it would be reasonable to have law enforcement or former police officers on the team or panel if they could be impartial, but we’ve spent decades giving police the opportunity to demonstrate that they can be impartial when investigating each other and they’ve proven time and again that they aren’t capable of doing so. The words “thin blue line” pretty much prove that police cannot be trusted to investigate other police."

Ive never done it and wont pretend to understand. I want justice, not mob justice."
18918,gyam1g,"I think its just logical.  We want people have experience in the area we are judging.  If we have a board overseeing construction, Id want construction workers on that board.  A medical review board should have doctors on it.  Not enough that the fox is guarding the henhouse, but people that aren't experts in a field or haven't worked it often don't always understand the situation well."
18919,gyam1g,"The issue I have is the math. With 2 on a 9 person board who will ALWAYS vote in favor of the officer, then we end up with a situation where less than half of the remaining citizens can stonewall any police action. 2 of nine leaves 7 ""citizens"". You would only need 3 of the 7 to form a coalition that prevents any action from being taken. Then we're back in a situation where a majority of citizens feel like an officer has done something wrong but nothing happens because the system is set up to favor them. 
A review board doesn't bypass the officer's legal rights. If recommended for charges, they would still have the full right of any other citizen to defend themselves in court. A review board also doesn't have the authority to punish outside of the contracted code of conduct. If an officer breaks the contractual code of conduct, then I think it's more fair to society that a third party review board oversees disciplinary action rather than the department itself. On top of all of that the review board will still be bombarded daily with police lobbying. It's not like they wouldn't have the ability to hear the officers perspective."
18920,gyam1g,"I think the last few decades show the cops don't know shit about anything that isn't shooting black people, aside from shooting other poor people.

So I don't exactly consider their expertise valid in prosecuting them shooting black people."
18921,fnvi7v,"Lest we forget the Miami, Florida post office where they found thousands of undelivered completed ballots in 2016.  Mail-in, drop-off, I'm on board.  If the ballots get back to the clerk's office."
18922,fnvi7v,NO...everybody should be mandated we're voting by mail period...and the election goes on as scheduled...don't let the asshat president invalidate the process either...!
18923,fnvi7v,"Yes, be like Oregon, vote by mail."
18924,fnvi7v,Please sign and share with everyone on your social media list!!
18925,fnvi7v,"Indiana got it together with a joint effort from Rs and Ds, and as I always say, if Indiana can figure it out, your state definitely can."
18926,fnvi7v,This is a really terrible idea. Poor people who cannot afford to take time off from work or their at-home lives will have less incentive to bootstrap themselves out of their financial situation in order to enjoy their constitutional rights.
18927,fnvi7v,As an Oregonian who already does. Yes. But this will hurt the GOO so it won't happens sadly.
18928,fnvi7v,I moved to a state that allows absentee (vote by mail). I voted in Feb. It was stress free not standing in long lines and dealing with last minute voting station changes.
18929,fnvi7v,"I was actually thinking about this the other day, already filled out and mailed in absentee ballot request for the primary."
18930,fnvi7v,"I am still voting for the Dems but my god they are determined to give the election to Trump. Please please please look at the things the House is asking for in their new relief bill proposal and then call your rep, tell them they are a fucking idiot. 

For the record everything they added is stuff I want but there are a ton of poison pills that the GOP wont support. Vote by mail is the one that we should keep for sure. But things like climate policy, immigration protections, and making companies turn over pay equity data. Those are all things the GOP will not support and the worst global crisis ever is not the time to push it.

Maybe it is not obvious so I will shout for everyone to here USING A CRISIS TO PUSH LEGISLATION THAT WOULD NOT PASS UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS IS EVIL. It is seriously one of the most heinous things any group can do. This is exactly the same as the GOP trying to shadowban abortion during the hurricane crisis. It is disgusting behavior.

If this continues, in 6 months the Trump ads will say, “Dems withheld emergency cash from you while your family was starving and out of a job” and they won’t even be lying."
18931,fnvi7v,This is a prelude to a cancelled election
18932,fnvi7v,yeah agree holding an offline election now would cause a lot of trouble and potential outbreaks
18933,fnvi7v,If only the petition didn't also mean I have to sign up for a mailing list...
18934,fnvi7v,This makes sense for so many reasons.
18935,fnvi7v,I disagree.
18936,fnvi7v,"And suddenly the citizenship question that was proposed for the census doesn't seem all that outlandish. Not even green card holders can vote. If we had had a citizenship question, we'd know how many ballots to send to each address and know that only legit ballots would be returned.

But now we can't have that because we would have no clue unless there were something included like maybe a voter ID number - which we also don't have."

18940,fnvi7v,You can now track your ballots. My wife did a mail in for the primaries
18941,fnvi7v,"Yes this. And they need to start ASAP. I DO NOT trust this president with anything less than an election on the current election day. We must have a consistent standard otherwise he will claim his loss is a fraud. Hell, he's going to do that *no matter what*"
18942,fnvi7v,[deleted]
18943,fnvi7v,Why
18944,fnvi7v,[deleted]
18945,fnvi7v,You give your address when you register to vote. No one is proposing that we auto-enroll every citizen
18946,fnvi7v,"I live in Florida, and you can do this. Though I don't live in that county, so idk if it's different. But the ballot goes in a paper sleeve (folded paper) and into an envelope with your barcode and signature on it. They scan when they receive your ballot envelope, and then they open the envelope and put the sleeved ballot in a stack so that it's anonymous now. You can go online and check when they scanned your ballot."
18947,fnvi7v,Bill Nelson?
18948,fnvi7v,"Why not? 

Why are you against people having the ability to vote easily?"
18949,fnvi7v,It compromises the secrecy of the ballot.
18950,fnvi7v,So you're saying we need voter IDs with unique ID numbers. That's cool.
18951,fnvi7v,"No one said anything anything about auto-enroll. Stop with the strawman bullshit.

An address means absolutely nothing. A voter ID (ostensibly) has a registration number that indicates eligibility to vote, is tied to an address, and is easy to check to see if they have already voted for that session.

Why is this so controversial except for fraudulent votes? Hmm? Why is is so satanic to have a foolproof way to make sure everyone who is eligible to vote only votes once?"
18952,fnvi7v,BECAUSE ID RATHER VOTE BY EMAIL THAN SNAIL MAIL.
18953,fnvi7v,"That’s fair. I’m sure there’s a way we could vote with a number we receive in the mail or something, which would make it just as secretive as it is now."
18954,fnvi7v,And what value does that provide? Elections don’t need to be instant.
18955,fnvi7v,I’m nervous about undue influence or coercion from other residents of the same household.

>Remember when you attack Trump, you’re helping him. Chuck Schumer, in trying to deal with health care in the Senate, has a new phrase, “Make America sick again.” See the problem? Schumer doesn’t and Nancy Pelosi doesn’t. I’ve been writing this stuff for how many years and they still don’t get it.

>Why is that slogan such a bad choice?

>“Make America sick again” is an example of negative framing. Not only negative framing, but it’s framing that helps Trump. Because it sounds like “Make America great again,” it activates that in your brain. Which is often what happens with negative framing. That’s a well-known phenomenon, when you negate stuff the positive stuff gets activated

18988,adp0ox,Fucking ponderous isn’t it? Like everything else that’s happened since 2015 when a failed conman/businessman and game show host announced he was running for potus. 
18989,adp0ox,even once respectable places like NPR can't handle this administration everything is constantly both sides. the other day on CNN they said both sides about the shutdown multiple times and Bill kristol of all people had to correct them. 
18990,adp0ox,"This is what happens when you let the very fragile feelings of the right dictate what you do.

The press has been doing this for decades because if they try to call anyone on the right out for their shit, the right loses it and goes batshit insane."
18991,adp0ox,That's what this is ultimately about.
18992,adp0ox,"The united states does not negotiate with terrorists. 

That should be the only response to this stupid wall shit "
18993,adp0ox,Trump creating problems then Solving the same problems he created with our money. 
18994,adp0ox,The Newsroom put it best: “The media is biased towards fairness”
18995,adp0ox,"I honestly expected this to happen when he first got elected. Im not even joking. I was saying he is totally gonna  philibuster until he gets whatever crazy thing he wants. To like coworkers, my grandmother, my brothers, and my dog lol. I mean lets be honest with ourselves here. Who the hell didn't see this coming. The philibuster was made for this hard headed bastard.
I am not sure if this is a philibuster but point still stands lol. Feel free to correct."
18996,adp0ox,"It really is fucking fascinating. Sometimes I joke that Trump has some type of Jedi mind power, with one wave he can just say “you did not see or hear me say what I actually said” and people genuinely seem to move on. 

Like wtf, THERE WERE CAMERAS PEOPLE. AUDIO. Why are we still acting like this isn’t solely Trump’s fault??"
18997,adp0ox,"That's because no one wants to give him credit for actually fulfilling a promise

Edit: i was kidding. Trump is a douche. Sorry, forgot the /s"
18998,adp0ox,Yeah. Theyre so used to doing that its like autopilot
18999,adp0ox,"Yeah but MS13 really is bad, mkay?"
19000,adp0ox,He told Nancy and Chucky that if they didn't do their job the gov't would be shut down and they could blame him if they'd like but Americans need to be protected but you do you.
19001,adp0ox,"The thing is, it totally is both sides' fault. Trump, warned that he was going to shut it down unless he got what he wanted. So, the Democrats have to accept accountability for their refusal to negotiate with terrorists. "
19002,adp0ox,"Well, yes, but in the end Dems are going to have to help provide a compromise solution. They don't have to agree to a wall, but real governance will mean helping find an acceptable solution. Like any compromise, I don't particularly like that they should have to compromise at all, but something will have to give somewhere. Trump will need to compromise a LOT more than the dems will. Personally I think the dems should suggest starting a bi-partisan committee to review all aspects of Trump's wall proposal. This is the step Trump should have taken in the first place rather than just trying to shove it down everyone's throat with no debate. "
19003,adp0ox,"I guess we will find out what is more important to democrats. Families having income to feed their kids or opposing trump. We already know trump is half a tard, our opinion of him and gop cant go lower. Democrats, however, have everything to lose."
19004,adp0ox,"I don't mean to be abrasive here, but even as a liberal, why is an infrastructure project that costs less than 1% of the GDP and will create jobs such a bad idea?"
19005,adp0ox,Corporate media gonna corporate. Nothing ponderous there. Some anchors might care about politics but their bosses all only care about their profits.
19006,adp0ox,"> ponderous
So you mean preposterous?
"
19007,adp0ox,"If you think this has to do with anything other than ratings, I believe you're mistaken.

Viewership on all networks is up thanks to the Trainwreck in Chief. People just can't stop watching bad news. It's no different from news hours leading off with stories about horrible crimes like murder/rape. Call it 'morbid curiosity'.

People are so concerned about the state of affairs we are glued to the TV to watch it all go down, which makes advertisers want to pay networks for ads, which makes the corporate news networks profits.

If people suddenly stopped watching and visiting websites for anything related to 'Trump' the media would eventually find something else to blow up and get viewership numbers back.



"
19008,adp0ox,Wait what? What do you mean?
19009,adp0ox,"The best analogy I saw for Trump's strategy is:

Trump- I am going to drown this kitten

Trump- ""proceeds to drown kitten""

19016,adp0ox,"Yeah but just because he says he “wants” something doesn’t mean he should get it. He wants to ban all Muslims from traveling here also, doesn’t mean he should get it. "
19017,adp0ox,Guys why the downvotes? The joke is the GOP are terrorists....
19018,adp0ox,Maybe put like a /s or something next time
19019,adp0ox,Trump also said he would own the shutdown. Which he does. 
19020,adp0ox,"You do realize that they already tried compromising and submitted the plan that the republican senate previously approved but now the senate speaker won’t allow forward because the Oval won’t sign it like a petulant child.  If compromise is to sip just a half cup of arsenic instead of a full cup, it’s not a good compromise.  Government shouldn’t be “let me make in inconceivable the starting ground so that we compromise at just extremely offensive. “"
19021,adp0ox,They have a solution: move on to something serious like healthcare.
19022,adp0ox,"> Democrats, however, have everything to lose.

No, Trump said he would shut down the government and **that he would own the shut down**. He can't blame the Democrats now.

No, the longer this last, the more Republicans will get pissed and call their senators and complain. So that when the Democrats impeach the president in the house, they will have the votes in the Senate to indict him."
19023,adp0ox,[deleted]
19024,adp0ox,"Even if you support the wall (which is laughable in and of itself), shutting down the government is not a valid negotiation tactic. This isn’t - or rather shouldn’t be - a debate about the wall, this is about government taking care of its responsibility to pay its bills. Imagine if you and your spouse are debating whether or not to build a fence so you just stop paying your bills and then you get an angry call from the utility company and your reply to why you aren’t paying your electricity is “why is a fence such a bad idea!?”"
19025,adp0ox,"I don’t know troll, why don’t you ask the republicans in the house and senate why?"

The only ‘good’ option here is Trump giving up his GOP utopian pipe dream of a fantasy border wall.

If he wants to shut down the government for “months or even years” because he wants to throw a temper tantrum from his ivory tower, then I would hope that would be cause to begin impeachment hearings."

19056,adp0ox,"So the onus is then on the president to do what is best for the federal employees and give it up. I am tired of the Democratic Party always being the one who has to compromise. Then republicans get in office and pass whatever the fuck they want in the dead of night without any input from the CBO, which they frothily demanded every time Obama wanted to sneeze.  Fuck these extremists, it’s time we took a principled stand, secure in the righteousness of our position because we have carefully done our due diligence. 

No matter how accommodating we are when in power, no matter how inclusive and compromising, no matter how many time we send our fucking president to public meetings with the republicans who’ve sworn to oppose him no matter what, no matter how many times we enter into our dialog with the right *-  in good faith every single time -*!no matter what we do the right is going to play the same game. They are going to make strawman arguments, rebrand things to stoke fear in their low information, low engagement base, they are going to prey on the American people while playing the victim, no matter what we do we have seen them do this for DECADES. Enough. Call out the hypocrisy. Save every goddamned post that /u/PoppinKREAM gifts to this community and add it to your bandolier of easy copy pasta, and wade into battle KNOWING that we can disenfranchise their game merely because we have reality and facts and the goddamned strength of diversity on our side. 

Fuck these cuckservative fuckers. I’m done. I’m planting my palm firmly on their foreheads and laughing while they throw their fists through the air impotently. My deep, sweet belly laughs drowning out whatever latest trumpertantrum they’ve decided to clutch their pearls over. Laughing because they represent the inevitable dying embers that are left to stamp out after a forest fire, and the only thing that will keep those embers burning is if we ignore them. Stamp them out, then welcome growth. "
19057,adp0ox,"Oh,  seriously?  If the President said he wanted Air Force 1 to receive a complete overhaul and he wouldn't reopen government until it passes,  what then?  What happens when he shuts down the government for something even more obviously self-serving?  If the legislative branch capitulate now then they'll be doing it all the way through Bannon Trump's coronation. 
No thanks."
19058,adp0ox,That’s not how any of this works. Trump can’t throw a tantrum and demand that we just give him what he wants. 
19059,adp0ox,[deleted]
19060,adp0ox,"I'm going to explain this simply since you are apparently completely fucking dense.

If the Dems agree to his demands to end the shutdown for something like this (even if it's only 1% of the GDP or whatever) then they have proven that they will cave, so whats to stop Trump from saying, ""OK, well now I want 10x as much! And if you don't give it to me **your** shutdown will continue!""?"
19061,adp0ox,Get out of here with that “as a liberal” bullshit. It’s obvious you’re just on here concern trolling you obvious troll you. 0/10. Try harder next time.

19063,adp0ox,I thought that was because dems were actually showing up to vote for once?
19064,adp0ox,Wrong. He is doing it right now
19065,adp0ox,"I guess I just don't see something so inconsequential as less than 1% of the GDP to be worth withholding people's paychecks over. And that applies to both sides. Both sides could easily solve this problem, and it is frustrating that they aren't willing to compromise. But that's just politics I guess."

They sure as hell aren't going to admit they were wrong and go against trump no matter how bad it gets. They've fucked up so hard that 80%+ of their voting base think trump is the best. If they do anything against trump, they're guaranteed to be voted out of office for even more racist mentally unstable trump wannabe politicians.

IDK if they'd follow through on their threats or not - but it would only take a very small percentage of them siding with the Dems to do something. "

19110,854erz,"**And you are lynching Negroes**

""And you are lynching Negroes"" (Russian: ""А у вас негров линчуют"", A u vas negrov linchuyut) and the later ""And you are hanging blacks"" are catchphrases satirizing Soviet propaganda's response to American criticisms of its human rights violations. Use of the phrases like these, exemplifying the tu quoque tactic, was an attempt to deflect criticism of the Soviet Union by referring to racial discrimination and lynching in the United States.

The Soviet media frequently covered racial discrimination, financial crises, and unemployment in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used as a form of rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings.

19112,854erz,"Many Republicans, sure. Probably even most Republicans would be willing to assist in Mueller's firing. But because the balance of power is fairly close in congress they'd effectively need (nearly) ALL Republicans to fall in line - and there are just too many vulnerable GOP members that would be too afraid to put their necks on the line for an unpopular President, IMO. 

With so much success in the recent special elections I think Democrats have signaled to Republicans that momentum is on their side and that any attempts to cover for Trump only weakens Republicans (from competitive districts) in the coming midterms. Had Democrats not had such success in places like PA-18 and Alabama it would be a lot easier for the Republicans to stay unified behind Trump - but in the current climate it's hard for me to see Republicans supporting Trump in the face of what I can only assume would result in tremendous public outcry and serve as a powerful motivator for progressive voters come November. And even if they did it would probably result in Democratic control of congress - in which case they've only accomplished a short delay before the investigations continue.

I could be wrong, of course - but the only way I see Trump eluding justice would be if the investigation is still going on at the end of 2018 and Republicans somehow cling to power through the midterms. Then, with 2 years until the next election cycle, Republicans probably would be far more likely to support Mueller's removal. 

Just another reason to keep fighting to get as many Democrats elected in 2018 as possible."

19124,gd2sia,"*Full text if paywalled for you; written by Fintan O’Toole*:

Over more than two centuries, the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity.

However bad things are for most other rich democracies, it is hard not to feel sorry for Americans. Most of them did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Yet they are locked down with a malignant narcissist who, instead of protecting his people from Covid-19, has amplified its lethality. The country Trump promised to make great again has never in its history seemed so pitiful.

Will American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode? The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming, the world’s best concentration of medical and scientific expertise, effectively limitless financial resources, a military complex with stunning logistical capacity and most of the world’s leading technology corporations. Yet it managed to make itself the global epicentre of the pandemic.

As the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic, “The United States reacted ... like Pakistan or Belarus – like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.”

It is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster, quite another to watch vast power being squandered in real time – wilfully, malevolently, vindictively. It is one thing for governments to fail (as, in one degree or another, most governments did), quite another to watch a ruler and his supporters actively spread a deadly virus. Trump, his party, and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News became vectors of the pestilence.

The grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish. What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisis,
demonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge, have been used by Trump merely to sow confusion and division. They provide a recurring horror show in which all the neuroses that haunt the American subconscious dance naked on live TV.

If the plague is a test, its ruling political nexus ensured that the US would fail it at a terrible cost in human lives. In the process, the idea of the US as the world’s leading nation – an idea that has shaped the past century – has all but evaporated.

Other than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who is now looking to the US as the exemplar of anything other than what not to do? How many people in Düsseldorf or Dublin are wishing they lived in Detroit or Dallas?

It is hard to remember now but, even in 2017, when Trump took office, the conventional wisdom in the US was that the Republican Party and the broader framework of US political institutions would prevent him from doing too much damage. This was always a delusion, but the pandemic has exposed it in the most savage ways.

What used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump – he has absorbed it. Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him. It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility, care and even safety.

Thus, even at the very end of March, 15 Republican governors had failed to order people to stay at home or to close non-essential businesses. In Alabama, for example, it was not until April 3 that governor Kay Ivey finally issued a stay-at-home order.

In Florida, the state with the highest concentration of elderly people with underlying conditions, governor Ron DeSantis, a Trump mini-me, kept the beach resorts open to students travelling from all over the US for spring break parties. Even on April 1, when he issued restrictions, DeSantis exempted religious services and “recreational activities.”

Georgia governor Brian Kemp, when he finally issued a stay-at-home order on April 1, explained: “We didn’t know that [the virus can be spread by people without symptoms] until the last 24 hours.”

This is not mere ignorance – it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity. There is, as the demonstrations this week in US cities have shown, plenty of political mileage in denying the reality of the pandemic. It is fuelled by Fox News and far-right internet sites, and it reaps for these politicians millions of dollars in donations, mostly (in an ugly irony) from older people who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

It draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories, hatred of science, paranoia about the “deep state” and religious providentialism (God will protect the good folks) that is now very deeply infused in the mindset of the American right.

Trump embodies and enacts this mindset, but he did not invent it. The US response to the coronavirus crisis has been paralysed by a contradiction that the Republicans have inserted into the heart of US democracy. On the one hand, they want to control all the levers of governmental power. On the other they have created a popular base by playing on the notion that government is innately evil and must not be trusted.

The contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump’s statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has “total authority”, and on the other that “I don’t take responsibility at all”. Caught between authoritarian and anarchic impulses, he is incapable of coherence.

But this is not just Donald Trump. The crisis has shown definitively that Trump’s presidency is not an aberration. It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it.

There are very powerful interests who demand “freedom” in order to do as they like with the environment, society and the economy. They have infused a very large part of American culture with the belief that “freedom” is literally more important than life. My freedom to own assault weapons trumps your right not to get shot at school. Now, my freedom to go to the barber (“I Need a Haircut” read one banner this week in St. Paul, Minnesota) trumps your need to avoid infection.

Usually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself, there is the comforting thought that, if things were really serious, it would all stop. People would sober up. Instead, a large part of the US has hit the bottle even harder.

And the president, his party and their media allies keep supplying the drinks. There has been no moment of truth, no shock of realisation that the antics have to end. No one of any substance on the US right has stepped in to say: get a grip, people are dying here.

That is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US – it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised. When the freak show is live on TV every evening, and the star is boasting about his ratings, it is not really a freak show any more. For a very large and solid bloc of Americans, it is reality.

And this will get worse before it gets better. Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017, he evoked “American carnage” and promised to make it stop. But now that the real carnage has arrived, he is revelling in it. He is in his element.

As things get worse, he will pump more hatred and falsehood, more death-wish defiance of reason and decency, into the groundwater. If a new administration succeeds him in 2021, it will have to clean up the toxic dump he leaves behind. If he is re-elected, toxicity will have become the lifeblood of American politics.

Either way, it will be a long time before the rest of the world can imagine America being great again."

19126,gd2sia,"I have been thinking of how to describe this presidency. It’s like there’s an extreme hypocrite at your church that you can’t stand to be around.

Suddenly, the pastor at the church puts this person in charge of the larger leadership role and is allowed to grant the friends of his liking to nearly all leadership roles. It’s now impossible for you to go to this church. Well, unfortunately we don’t have the option to leave."

19139,gd2sia,"Trying out a new metaphor/analogy here: If America is obesity, Trump is basically Type 2 diabetes. The glucose levels go up and the body basically loses the ability to moderate them properly. It can be partially, even at times fully, reversed, but mainly the system stays that way. I'm not suggesting this has to stay that way, but the analogy might be apt. One can work it out in various ways: the blood glucose sticks onto the walls of veins and arteries, leading to long term damage. Nerve damage/neuropathy ensues, eyesight is damaged, etc., all from this buildup, which is similar to the ongoing buildup of bullshit coming from Trump. 

The solution lies mainly in treating the obesity, just as it does in Type 2 diabetes. The ""sugar"" involved is the hard thing to identify. Like the sugar that is ""in everything"" (seemingly) in the American diet, there is one main ingredient involved in the American obesity. It's not capitalism as such, although there is a relationship to capitalism. The ingredient is *cherry picking*. 

&#x200B;

While I said I was trying out a new metaphor, I've been thinking that this problem of cherry picking as being at the root of the problem for a long time and it really seems to bear repeated use and scrutiny. Look for yourself: I think you'll find that in virtually every position/policy/action/statement, etc., that is problematic in ""that way"" (we're after what way that ultimately is), you'll see that it can be boiled down to a kind of cherry picking. The situations are all *motivated*, to be sure: by some kind of capital/profit interest, existential self-defense and self-spin, etc., but then, don't we all have these as basic dimensions, to some degree? Even as Trump is faulted for narcissism, it is important to recognize that the psychoanalysis that developed this concept as a dimension of personality insisted from the start that everyone has narcissism; its just not pathological. The issue isn't the narcissism; it's the way it's making its way through a procedure of cherry picking. 

Get cherry picking, identify it, combat it, say its name out loud. ""You're cherry picking"". One nice approach with Republicans is to come at a conversation with them not announcing your political alignment. Rather, just say, ""I care less about party. What bothers me most is cherry picking"". Then go into an explanation of what cherry picking is. They will tend to agree. It's not hard to get that agreement at that point. 

Now, here is what will happen: As you enter into discussion of an issue, you will be able to unfold just how cherry picking is happening in a given issue (health care, say). They will tend to agree. Then they will do something funny. As you go on, they'll quite possibly launch into a kind of ""yeah but"" thing in which they basically cherry pick something. I've seen this a number of times. I think at that point it is necessary that people start to say, ""No! You are cherry picking that and I'm not cooperating with that ANY MORE!"" I mean, be loud, forceful, if not aggressive, but don't back own. You made it clear, they agreed. They know perfectly well what they want to do is cherry pick. They kind of know *that* they are doing it, although it's a little opaque. They've never, it is likely, had it made thematic. If they do finally get hip to the basic criticism, they will move to the other main Republican operation: shutting down the conversation altogether. I've seen this on numerous occasions, but it doesn't happen when you lead with the ""I hate cherry picking"" idea. 

And I think at that point it is necessary, again, to reply strongly: ""NO! It is NOT OK to just shut down the conversation right now, suddenly!"" I remember I had one conversation with this guy, and when it got ""difficult"" (for him), he said, ""I think we should change the subject."" So I did so. Then....something occurred to him about what we had been talking about, and he jumped back into it: ""But such and such...."" And I just came back with, ""Oh no! You don't get to shut down the conversation and then start it up when you suddenly want to say something!"" We sat in silence after that. But the corruption of his procedure was clear.

Now, based on what I've said here, you might discern a neat little point: look at that ""shut down"" of the conversation I just mentioned. If I'm right, isn't that shut down going to amount in a way to a kind of cherry picking? Indeed it is. Think about it. You'll see that it is an option that is simply cherry picked."

The US will continue to be a force globally until oil is replaced by renewable energy. Then the US currency will cease being the world standard and our debt will consume our economy.

From her beacon-hand glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame, ""Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!"" cries she with silent lips. ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore, Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" 

Trump:  ""I'm closing the border."""
19184,gd2sia,Canada cannot solve America's problems.  There aren't enough of us.  Europe can't either because there's not enough room.
19185,gd2sia,"Ironically the US had a good solution to this at first, Federalism. With some exceptions, States were supposed to be countries unto themselves, similar to how EU countries are within the EU.  


In such a situation, having a good governor and state representatives was far more important than having a good president and federal congressmen.   


Out of 50 states, no doubt many would be run as one desired (e.g. universal healthcare, taxpayer funded college, etc.) and you could just vote with your feet. With an all powerful federal government however, about 50% of the population will be upset at any given time and the states don't have much ability to provide services or distinguish themselves from other states."

19187,gd2sia,"I live in Michigan. Armed, mostly male and white MAGA-hat wearing protestors broke into our capital building last week. Trump egged them on with tweets of “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” That orange bastard wants a civil war. I’ve felt like a wire stripped of its protective coating—I’ve been more on edge now than during any other presidency. The entire response to this virus, from the president down to his worshippers, has been Operation Stupid.

America doesn’t need pity, it needs buckets of common sense."
19188,gd2sia,It would be a great way to acquire some brain drain from the US
19189,gd2sia,"that would be pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good. Then our country would really be great again."
19190,gd2sia,"There’s no way they can win legally, but  nothing is below the bastards."
19191,gd2sia,You are delightful. Nice to see someone here whose not a troll!
19192,gd2sia,"People have left their homes for a better life many times throughout history. Doesn't make them weak or not sad to go, they just want something different than what's at hand."
19193,gd2sia,Sorry man but we gotta vote him out democracy won’t survive another trump term. He’s just too authoritarian.
19194,gd2sia,"> I like the President.

Why?"
19195,gd2sia,"Okay maybe you don't agree with his positions, but in what way is Bernie evil?"
19196,gd2sia,NO
19197,gd2sia,I think OP was asking whether you’d be taking any American refugees.
19198,gd2sia,Or show up and hand out paper towels. Then brag about his great effort and how they were the best paper towels in the world.
19199,gd2sia,"To be fair, smarter people came up with dumber ideas to use nuclear weapons for back in the 50s and 60s."
19200,gd2sia,"And removing all oversight from mandated funding so no one sees where the money is going, completely blocking funding to necessary programs like the WHO, and cutting back necessary safety nets that are necessary right now.

Refusing to step up and take a leadership role and help to unite the nations of the world together to fight this. And so on and so forth.  He is basically trying to use this event to prove that Capitalism can solve anything and the thing is it is tremendously failing.  From the recommended ventilator vendor running off with $69 mil, to states having to place PPE and tests under armed guard to prevent the Feds from seizing it, and the unwillingness for the administration to work with food producers to get it where it needs to go."
19201,gd2sia,The r/Keep_Track sub is very good about keeping lists for this sort of thing! Highly recommend

Wow! I'm so glad to find this. There is so much bad shit that it's hard to remember it  all. Very well organized and presented.
Thank you!"
19203,gd2sia,"It would be deeply ironic if Americans were subject to the same ""stay in your country and make it better!"" rhetoric that a significant proportion of its populace screams at those fleeing humanitarian crises."
19204,gd2sia,"There’s so much corruption, so much serious money working to subordinate the voice of majority America. It’s gotten out of control.
Seriously, I talk about moving out, but if this next election isn’t legit I will make it my mission to seek justice. 
If we can’t change the direction of America now, no place will be safe. 
It’s do or die."
19205,gd2sia,Oh...no it can’t solve America’s problems...I just want to abandon ship if Trump wins again is all.
19206,gd2sia,"No, but you have more land and in America, land has more rights than people. We can teach you a thing or... You know what, we'll just stay here and deal with our mess. Thanks for being there for us to talk things through. I need you Canada, if only for moral support and a hat tip."
19207,gd2sia,"Enough room is definitely accurate, maybe Europe and Canada can swap places."
19208,gd2sia,Not going to happen they need our money if California breaks away who is going to provide for the rest of the country
19209,gd2sia,I live in Michigan as well. Your comment really freaks me out. I never thought about the idea he may Ben churning these assholes up so he can do a call to arms if he loses
19210,gd2sia,"I love how these nudniks who will follow him into Hell think nationalism is the vaccine to a virus with no vaccine and no resistance through herd immunity.

It's meta-level stupidity and the greatest indictment in my lifetime that proves out the clear decline of the American education system since Reagan.  The New Federalists took the federal government out of the educational framework game and handed it to the states and private sector who ignored it's importance to making a great nation.  It's just another profit sector.  Sad."
19211,gd2sia,"Fair, just remember to get in the back of the line consisting of 100000s of immigrants currently waiting to get into the united states. 

You guys sounds like a bunch of spoiled children."
19212,gd2sia,"Because he likes it when presidents look the other way and allow 70,000 Americans to die in a 45 day period while simultaneously claiming victory and also refusing to take responsibility"
19213,gd2sia,He's probably 14 and hates minorities.
19214,gd2sia,[removed]
19215,gd2sia,"Oh I see, you're right. Will delete now"
19216,gd2sia,...in the 50s and 60s we didn’t know nearly as much about the long term effects of nuking the planet either.
19217,gd2sia,"I never want to hear the word tremendous again.
Trump is a tremendous asshole."
19218,gd2sia,"Thanks! I didn't know about that!

Now, the real question is whether I want to keep depressing myself by looking at it."
19219,gd2sia,I know. You can't keep up with it all.
19220,gd2sia,"Vocal minority. I feel like they should do a social media search and anyone who has ever said ""GO BACK TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY"" or anything like that should be banned from entering."
19221,gd2sia,"""Significant portion"" is not true at all. The very **vast** majority of Americans have no problem with a majority of immigration in its various degrees and forms. The people you are referring to are a very very vocal minority, fringe group of the far right"
19222,gd2sia,It's not just America. That's the standard nationalist motto.
19223,gd2sia,"The people who would be fleeing the US aren't the ones saying that. The ones who say ""fix your own country"" also tell those of us trying to fix the US that we can leave if we don't like it."
19224,gd2sia,Hey...let it empty of those who are not Trumptards then shut it off and hold those idiots accountable.
19225,gd2sia,"Joking aside, I'm waiting for other countries to start denying US immigrants. To my knowledge it's already fairly difficult to emigrate to another country, and if our president keeps pissing in everyone's hands I'm assuming it's only going to get harder. 

I would like to see an end to the ""if you don't like it, leave"" argument, though"
19226,gd2sia,"Due to our healthcare laws, immigration away from America is harder than lots of countries.  Because we get free healthcare when moving to other countries, but they don't get it if they move to our country."
19227,gd2sia,Well he is ...
19228,gd2sia,Racist Trump puppet
19229,gd2sia,"The Venn diagram of people who shout “GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY” and people who are upset by the current administration looks like this: 


0






































0"
19230,gd2sia,Those people should be forced to go back to where their grandparents were from.
19231,gd2sia,Doesn't have to be a majority to be statistically significant.
19232,gd2sia,"It's already pretty difficult to legally immigrate to Canada and other countries , and that's ok. Canada for example needs proof that you  are financially stable , have the skills to get a good job etc. We could learn a lot from them."
19233,gd2sia,Grandparents were all born here. But I will happily return to Sweden.
19234,gd2sia,Also doesn’t have to be a majority to snag an electrical college win apparently
19235,gd2sia,minority rule is never a good thing
