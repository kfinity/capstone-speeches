0,gv53cu,Hes heading straight in the direction of dictatorship
1,gv53cu,Antifa has killed fewer people during the last twenty years than the kkk killed last yeae
2,gv53cu,"We need to clarify to people: 

1. Antifa is not an organization. There are no “chapters” for a club / group called Antifa, antifa is short for anti-fascist. It’s a political stance. Libertarians are antifa, technically. 
2. These protests are being organized by Black Lives Matter, not the Antifa club, which doesn’t exist. 
3. There has been reports with *photographic/video* evidence of protesters shutting down looters, undercover cops attempting to escalate peaceful protests into riots, and even a neat piles of bricks showing up in the middle of a sidewalk. 
4. Do not address the moments of violence in predominantly peaceful protests without addressing a foundation of violent, racist oppression that this system was built - and currently operates - upon."
3,gv53cu,What's disturbing is that he was actually enforcing greater means of violence.
4,gv53cu,"Trump just keeps marching along to where he wanted to go the whole time.  Of course he isn't going to say anything nice about the protesters, they don't look like him.  This whole situation has taken an already incomprehensibly insane predicament and cranked it up into a terrifying waking nightmare.

After seeing increasing amounts of hate & lies being spewed about antifa elsewhere on reddit, I finally decided to join this sub.  The disinformation campaign has gone way beyond making me sick, I am enraged.  I'm personally very much against violence in all but the clearest cases of self defense, and I'm glad to see evidence in the feed here that many/most members of antifa feel the same.

The rise of fascism is not a joke.  The willingness of powermad authoritarian types to dehumanize anyone who isn't like them is not some simple matter of disagreement.  These people actively want to go to war against their own fellow citizens.  They want to torture or kill you for not being like them, and they aren't going to change their minds.  This massively angers me, to the point where my inner child wants to fight fire with fire, but I know a peaceful movement will accomplish more good and is a reflection of the kind of world we want to live in.  We may not be able to win over actual fascists, but the people around them who have been deluded into thinking they're okay can be shown the truth.  The lies will not stand up to scrutiny if we keep publicly showing that they are, in fact, lies."
5,gv53cu,“Antifa custody” LMAO
6,gv53cu,Trumps a garbage leader. Need to break up the police public unions and how they work or we will never solve police brutality.
7,gv53cu,"He did say this -

""All Americans are rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family, justice will be served. He will not have died in vain.""

Right before he talked about militarized response to protests."
8,gv53cu,He made sure to mention the 2nd amendment too. His rhetoric is purposeful and dangerous.
9,gv53cu,"Oh he said something about it...

https://streamable.com/26m8g0"
10,gv53cu,"Be fair. He has said many things about reforming police tactics. He has said to remove due process, be more violent, and pardon police who beat up protesters."
11,gv53cu,"Yes he did. He said kick them harder when they’re down, carry bigger guns, give them longer sentences, and be rougher with them when they’re in cuffs. 

“Trump doesn’t care about police brutality.” Is incorrect. He cares deeply about it, he likes it, and he is actively encouraging more of it."
12,gv53cu,Trump has said things about reforming aggressive policing tactics.  He likes them and makes them worse.  [https://civilrights.org/trump-rollbacks/](https://civilrights.org/trump-rollbacks/)
13,gv53cu,"Plus, these people running around attacking people saying they're antifa, are fucking gopers dressed up causing trouble."
14,gv53cu,"Because Trump doesn't give a fuck about George Floyd, or any other African Americans that die at the hand of police."
15,gv53cu,"Sure he has.   He's suggested that police shouldn't be too nice when arresting people.   

Oh, that's not the kind of reform you meant...  

:("
16,gv53cu,The only person to die during these riots was shot by the National Guard in Loueville protecting his BBQ joint from looters.
17,gv53cu,How to join antifa?
18,gv53cu," I am absolutely disgusted by the criminal behavior displayed by numerous police departments in the US. They murder black folk with impunity and respond to peaceful protesters protesting police brutality with with gunshots and more violence, they send in undercover cops to instigate riots to justify brutalizing everyone there. They casually put sticks in the hands of detained individuals so that they can break hands with ""justification."" They attack the FREE PRESS. They attack ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES THAT THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE. So called ""good"" cops stand by and protect their murderous piece of shit brothers and sisters in blue from arrest and justice. It's totally unacceptable and deserves justice.

The police were founded as a racist institution enforcing laws, known as the pig laws, designed to re-enslave black folks after the civil war. JUST laws need to be upheld and enforced but the police have no accountability and were rotten from their inception. Despite any good they do they're no more than state sanctioned gangs of murderers. They need to fire every single police officer and dissolve the police departments while handing their duties and military equipment over to the National Guard for a temporary interim while a new law enforcement agency, a Guardian Department, is recruited, thoroughly trained in the proper use of force and deescalation, sworn to actually serve and protect, and thorough background checks done on every new Guardian. Any applicant who is discovered to have domestic abuse, white supremacy ties, attended a ""warrior"" style training, or have a police violence record will be banned from ever being on or working with a Guardian Force and prosecuted for any discovered crimes. The Guardians will not be allowed military equipment and will be held accountable to an independent investigative body as well as requiring Guardians to adhere to the military code of conduct or be court martialed. Since it's designed to turn protectors of the public into combatants against the public, ""warrior"" style training will be be made illegal and departments or individuals caught using it prosecuted and jailed.

You can scoff but anything short of a total overhaul of the police force will be a futile and pointless exercise. The civil unrest will not stop until the police are held accountable and the public no longer trusts the police. We the people are not sheep to be slaughtered by blue wolves and we will not allow them to continue murdering us with impunity."
19,gv53cu,Never thought I'd agree so much with what the terrorists are saying.
20,gv53cu,Let's declare the Police a terrorist organisation!
21,gv53cu,Honest question: has antifa ever killed anyone?
22,gv53cu,"A real leader would speak up and enact sweeping policy change within law enforcement.

Instead we've got a pathetic buffoon that talks big then when real action is needed he hides away with the lights off.

There is a reoccurring theme in this administration to silence those who don't fall inline with their agenda. Instead of taking ownership of a situation, they deflect and cower when put under any amount of scrutiny. We're at a dangerous point in this nation. Everyone should be outraged at the erosion of our constitutional rights and freedom."
23,gv53cu,Why would he speak against something he supports?
24,gv53cu,I remember when we invaded Afghanistan? Fun times
25,gv53cu,Fun Fact - there is a blanket~

28,gv53cu,">my friend

Edit: misspelled Finn as Fun"
29,gv53cu,Fun fact. It was very fascinating.
30,gv53cu,Fun fact! This is wholesome.
31,gv53cu,"Condemning - yes. Reform across the board - no. We can’t even agree on stimulus packages to help Americans during a pandemic. How the heck do you think both sides are going to agree on police reform. It’s much easier to get legislation passed at the state level rather than the federal. This is a systemic and continual problem that has plagued America since the inception of the police force. Blaming one side and other isn’t going to resolve these problems. 

Police reform is something the individual states should reform. They are the closest to their communities, can provide more meaningful oversight, implement regulations that are tailored to the respective states needs."
32,gv53cu,"Antifa was declared a terrorist organization because they are a threat to the current racist order, the police haven't been mentioned because they are preserving it."
33,gv53cu,"Maybe we shouldn’t talk about ANTIFA like it’s an actual organization. Everyone who believes life has its own intrinsic value beyond what can be monopolized is ANTIFA. 

FUCK FACISM"
34,gv53cu,"Goes to show he doesn’t solve problems, he multiplies problems"
35,gv53cu,Cop is facing a murder charge.

37,gv53cu,Time to declare the police a terrorist organization.
38,gv53cu,And y’all wanted trump to be president lmao
39,gv53cu,[removed]
40,gv53cu,Why would a fascist reform aggressive policing tactics when that’s exactly what he wants?
41,gv53cu,"It's hard to insist Trump reform anything. The man has a very poor reading comprehension. 

I just can't fathom having to sit down, as lead advisers, and having to explain to him what reformation is, and what tactics are, and why they're problematic now. You know he can't sit still, and he will either wander off to find an Adderall, or insist he takes the meeting while watching Fox News. 

We elected an 8 year old with a severe concentration disorder."
42,gv53cu,Fun fact: it is not wrong to kill police
43,gv53cu,Probably because they are happening in cities that have been under Democratic control for decades and they haven't done shit?
44,gv53cu,When are we allowed to hunt nazis?

61,gv53cu,"Yeah.  It's the direction the U.S. has been heading in for a long time.  With every administration presidential powers grow and grow and grow, and form a new baseline for the next one to abuse and amplify further.  Shit's gotta stop, and stop *now*."

66,gv53cu,"Well that’s convenient when “ANTIFA isn’t an organization, it’s a philosophy”."
67,gv53cu,[removed]
68,gv53cu,"> Libertarians are antifa, technically. 

Well, they technically *should* be. And yet, when push comes to shove, we often see 'liberatrians' pushing on the fascist side. Usually, all it takes to get libertarians on the side of fascism is to promise them tax cuts."
69,gv53cu,"1. BLM is anti-fascist in nature (though a lot of other organizations and movements are too, of course).
2. Protesters policing themselves isn't that great of a practice when a diversity of tactics will do.
3. ""Peaceful"" is a stupid and arbitrary notion pushed onto us by a liberal state which seeks to legitimize fascist violence and de-legitimize all effective resistance.
4. Pretending that protesters don't do things like expropriate wealth and destroy property in fact serves to remove their agency.

The property destruction and expropriation is all or almost all justified by the violence of the system (economic, political, militarized policing, etc.) under which it occurs.  The violent state repression and systemic racism is absolutely not.  I don't think we should allow ourselves to get distracted by who broke what window or who got what brick from where.  Those things are pretty irrelevant in the scheme of what is happening.  And where they aren't convenient for excusing more state/fascist violence, other excuses will be found anyway.

What remains is that white people (and more privileged people in general) should be always mindful of the context in which the tactics they are using exists, and the likely repercussions of those tactics on the people immediately around them.  So, for example, it's important to let black people lead in the immediate struggle for their own liberation.  But that's always the case, is often actual practice in the streets, and will never be a consideration heeded by provocateurs or people this online messaging might be aimed at anyway, so it's hardly worth mentioning outside of organizer trainings and education."

73,gv53cu,"My in-laws are die-hard Republicans. My wife tried explaining to her mother last night why Trump threatening violence is bad.

74,gv53cu,">I’m personally very much against violence in all but the clearest cases of self defense, and I'm glad to see evidence in the feed here that many/most members of antifa feel the same.

Yeah there is nothing inherently violent about anti-fascism. It literally just means that you are against fascism and are doing something about it, doing what you can to resist fascism.

The soldiers who fought against nazis in the WW2 were being anti-fascists. The anarchists who fought against ISIS were anti-fascist. These are violent means of anti-fascism, because war is always violents.

But the vast, vast majority of anti-fascist action is non-violent. In nazi Germany, the people who helped Jews by hiding them in their homes were anti-fascists. You can be an anti-fascist by trying to educate ignorant people about the dangers of fascism and the tactics fascists use to normalize bigotry. You can be an anti-fascist by gluing stickers around town or by bringing water and food and other supplies to protestors. Hell, even simply flagging hateful content and bigoted comments online to get them taken down is every day anti-fascism.

>members of antifa

Just a quick reminder that antifa doesn’t have membership. It is not an organization, and you cannot join it."
75,gv53cu,Do you think the protesters and the rioters are the same people?
76,gv53cu,He's for sure going to be active...
77,gv53cu,"Yeah, make sure you ""hit their heads on the door when you put them in the car"".

And the fucking people cheered."
78,gv53cu,"“I pardon you.”

Wtf"
79,gv53cu,Yup. This is policing.
80,gv53cu,"Pretty sure a police officer died in Oakland, which is kinda sad because Oakland is one of the cities that has made systemic changes to policing instead of placating people with talk about better training while they still get away with murder."
81,gv53cu,"Are you against fascism?

Congratulations. 

Anti-fa is anti fascism. That’s all you need to be to “join”."
82,gv53cu,"Find some like-minded people, do Antifa things."
83,gv53cu,"You can't join,  there are no members, it's more of an action you can take than an organisation."
84,gv53cu,"No clue about America but I know ""antifascists"" (allegedly ""The Fighting People's Revolutionary Powers"") retaliated against the murder of Pavlos Fyssas in Greece. Not long after the police protection on the Golden Dawn office ceased a couple fighters pulled up on a motorcycle and one of them shot a few self-identified fascists, two of them died while the motorcycle ones got away and still haven't been caught.

&#x200B;

Antifa is not some international organisation (could even be several groups within a single city) so realistically your question could be interpreted in vastly different ways."
85,gv53cu,The short answer is 'no'.
86,gv53cu,"No, because ""antifa"" is not an organization that can engage in, or take blame for, motive actions.  

Until you acknowledge that fact, every time you repeat this shit *it will not be an honest question*."

I appreciate your other clarifications, I knew some of my phrasing was probably off.  Thanks for all the info, I need to do more research to clarify and support future action."
120,gv53cu,Absolutely not. Police are the rioters.
121,gv53cu,I don't get the impression Trump cares about the distinction. He got his thugs to use tear gas to clear an area of peaceful protesters for a photo shoot. He seems VERY okay with using police brutality to try (and fail) to deal with riots and protests about fucking police brutality.
122,gv53cu,Yup. In the beginning of December through mid-January.
123,gv53cu,It was a premeditated drive bye and there is no evidence it had to do with the riots. Cop was hit in NY by a car though.

The chokehold ban has the exception that the officers can use them if they feel their life is in danger, which is their word against someone they choked to death. 

It's completely performative bullshit so he could have a photo op with police. All those things have been used in police departments all over the country and none of them have shown any progress. They are toothless reforms.

168,gv53cu,"oh yeah absolutely antifa (which is a fucking adjective, not a group) is identical to ISIS - well, if you exclude being in completely separate countries, antifa not being motivated by religion nor territory and also being progressive rather than becoming a kratero-caliphate. oh, and also the fact that ISIS recorded the decapitation of tourists to spread fear which antifa definitely hasn't

but i guess they both wear black, so theyre the same"

I dunno. In the state of police training these days, there's a *lot* of emphasis on things like 'make sure you make it home in one piece' ... which apparently means shooting the fuck out of anyone who poses even the slightest hint of a threat."
185,gv53cu,"I just remember taking a law class at the end of last year and that’s what they had said, taking out the gun was the very last thing they were suppose to do. Either way it’s sad that we have idiots as cops, and a horrible system."
186,gv53cu,"Heh, yeah. That's the difference between a law class and a police training class.

Legally, you're absolutely right. Taking their gun out should be their absolute last resort. But the way a lot of cops are trained, taking their gun out is step #1 ... just in case they might need it."

The swedish police fucking HATE illegal raves and will OFTEN do everything they can to fuck it up, uncluding having undercover cops.

So the artist remixed his own song to say ”everyone who is not dancing are undercover cops”

Their awkward asses are crazy easy to spot.

204,gtl07d,"A bit late to comment but in Hong Kong we have everyone tuck in their shirts if we suspect there is undercover police. This way, they have no opportunity to hide firearms in their waistband under their shirt.

We've had several dangerous cases of this where an undercover policeman will randomly pull a pistol and start shooting when discovered, so it's quite important."
205,gtl07d,If the guys wearing Kevlar vests and radios don't make you immediately aware of the fact that they're plainclothes cops you've got bigger problems. I've seen this same picture 12 times in 2 hours because its not a secret that they're cops and its not meant to be.

256,gtl07d,"Maybe it’s coincidence but why are all their ball caps backwards? Like, hi fellow protesters!"
257,gtl07d,Also worth noting is that there seems to be a preference to have the cap backwards if you're working undercover.
258,gtl07d,"They're just plain clothed not undercover, the big badge on display in full view is a giveaway."
259,gtl07d,It really is impossible to make you look worse than you already do.
260,gtl07d,"In the original pic he also has very recognizable boots. They looked like steel toe police issue. You can also see a wire peeking from under the shirt on his right side, but no headphones. And he’s wearing a bracelet that someone thought looked like a “thin blue line” bracelet. In the original, the man in a black t-shirt who is partially cropped in this one has a matching bracelet and also a visible line under the t-shirt of a vest.

I know it’s easier to check for the vest/no mask but memorizing all of the small details like this is good info to have if you only catch a glimpse of someone sus. The boots were a dead giveaway to me"
261,gtl07d,"The only thing they are scared of is being attacked by their own coworkers and beaten to death, hence the armband to make sure that the other piglets recognize them."

272,gtl07d,"Don't identify people as cops when you don't have 100% proof of it. You may either hurt a genuine protester or simply make everyone suspicious of cops and unwilling to take action. Who is initiating action doesn't matter much, actions are good or they aren't regardless of who does it. Cops have plenty reasons to take part in violence against property which aren't ""making the riots look bad"", for example an undercover cop can simply try to blend in, or cops can target a home/local business of someone they wanted to bully while blaming it on the riots (cops are just a mafia/thugs, riots like this are a problem as they question their authority but it also gives them a lot of opportunities to act like assholes).

This is serious by the way, ligitimate activists have been ""outed"" as cops and were later identified by people at the protests allowing the real cops to arrest them. Still if you feel like someone is a cop, be wary of them but don't try to ""dox"" them."

289,gtl07d,"Fascism is a political ideology defined by social and political authoritarianism and ultra-nationalism. This is supported by ferocious anti-liberalism, anti-socialism and a violently exclusionist expansionist agenda. It also espouses a corporatist economic system.

The nationalist element is core to fascism as it sees the nation as the key societal element and the strenghth of that nation is paramount to the exclusion of virtually all else. To further this fascism always paints ""its group"" as the hard done by victim and ties up an individuals self esteem into the greater glory and achievments of the group. This links back into the corporatist economic ideas of fascism.

It seems obvious to us, because we are used to cops infiltrating not only our protests but even our discords and personal spaces. Many of them still think there's some expectation of fair play. 

The modern anti-fascist movement has been learning from protests since Occupy Wallstreet. Many of us are essentially professionals at it. This isn't just comrades. This is everyone from all walks of life. There are people left right and centre in these protests. Even many of my conservative family members are protesting right now along side other Black Lives Matter protestors. Not as infiltrators, as active participants who are done with police brutality and extrajudicial murder. I've even seen some comedy YouTubers post videos of them being shot at with rubber bullets and tear gas. So many people who've never experienced anything like this before.

That's why it's so important people like OP are spreading the info. To turn the newbies into educated and ready protestors.

>The **color of the day** is a signal used by [plainclothes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plainclothes_law_enforcement) officers of some police departments in the United States. It is used to assist in the identification of plainclothes police officers by uniformed officers. It is used by the New York City Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.

>A plainclothes police officer will wear a headband, wristband or other piece of clothing in the color of the day, and officers will be told of this color at the police station before they start work.

328,gtl07d,"Apologies in advance that what was at first a simple question turned into a bit of a rant as I typed away. Even though I'm just some white boy in rural America I'm rather anxious about all of this and my mind runs wild with fears in the face of something like this, as I'm sure it does for us all.

I'll start off for full disclosure saying that I'm an outsider to the Antifa crowd who especially in the past few days have been trying to gain more understanding and insight on what the overall modern US movement is like now.

With that said, and you don't have to be the one to respond if you haven't gotten to that place yet I understand at the time of posting this you were still having to process whatever happened, but I just want to know what's happened in Seattle? I've seen a lot of videos from many cities including from there where the police response was clearly too aggressive at best and horrific and possibly treasonous at worst including a certain case of a journalist suffering permanent injuries to her eye at the hands of a cop from the police line that opened fire on her, though I believe that was in Minneapolis, which was easily the worst I've seen by far. Well, then there was the clip of a protester apparently being hit by a tear gas canister at near point blank range right before the video cuts out, that one really disturbed me and I'm just hoping to hear he was okay and it wasn't what it looked like or something so if any of you know what I'm talking about and know an update on his condition I'd appreciate that.

Is this the type of things you're talking about? I want to believe these videos are rare extremes but yet I can't help but anxiously wonder how much has transpired off camera, or how many peaceful or at least relatively peaceful protestors and even journalists have been injured or maimed. It disturbs me, but I can't help but pursue and try to know whatever I can so if any of you wouldn't mind giving me an account of your experiences I would greatly appreciate it. Though and I'm sure the vast majority of this sub is very aware of this anyway I would caution any of you to avoid any potentially identifying details especially since there's already trolls prowling around convinced any and everyone under your label are scum of the Earth terrorists."

484,e8jzer,"I read the *Burdic v. United States* source link from that page, and there's this paragraph:

> This brings us to the differences between legislative immunity and a pardon. They are substantial. The latter carries an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it. The former has no such imputation or confession. It is tantamount to the silence of the witness. It is noncommittal. It is the unobtrusive act of the law given protection against a sinister use of his testimony, not like a pardon, requiring him to confess his guilt in order to avoid a conviction of it.

**But**, the Wikipedia article makes it pretty clear (to me anyway) that it's not settled fact that a pardon requires an admission of guilt, because this is an example of a [dictum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictum).

TL;DR it's not legally binding that accepting a pardon is an admission of guilt, but because an important decision says so, that point of view carries a lot of weight."

563,e8jzer,"It's mostly simple toxic masculinity.  Our (American here) imperialist, misogynist, cis-heteronormative culture defines men partially by their capacity for and willingness to commit acts of violence.  Aggression in men is a virtue and gentleness in men is a vice; everything a cis-hetero male is gets filtered through those ideas.  Sex becomes about dominance and bragging rights rather than mutual pleasure.  A preference for art over athletics becomes a sign of weakness and effeminacy.  The rejection of all things supposedly feminine leads to a diminished capacity for empathy and an admiration for callousness and performative cruelty.  Homosexuality/bisexuality, submissive heterosexual men, and trans-women are reviled because, in the minds of fascists, they each represent a rejection of ""true"" masculinity and strength and an embrace of ""unnatural"" femininity and weakness.  (Trans-men don't really seem to really exist in the fascist mind when the fascists aren't busy victimizing them in some way.  This is likely due to a belief that being male is a natural aspiration.)

Once aggression and violence have become virtues and gentleness and empathy have become vices, social value and self-worth can be derived partially from the degree of aggression one displays and the amount of violence one engages in."

588,e8jzer,"As someone noted, under those circumstances there are legal processes to grant relief. A pardon/clemency is for when the President essentially thinks the judicial branch overreached, and it's a check on their power.

**Normally** there is a process. The President doesn't issue pardons on a whim, they have a whole agency process to search through applications for clemency, find people who are worthy, narrow down based on mitigating circumstances etc. until they have a list of people deserving of an extraordinary use of constitutional authority.

> The lawsuit states that Boyd ran away and tried to get into a locked police vehicle, then ran to a neighbor’s house screaming for help and asking someone to call police. Officers decided he was on drugs or suffering from a medical emergency and that he needed to be taken to the hospital for an emergency evaluation.


> Boyd’s family also contended that Boyd should not have been given Haldol. State protocols for emergency medical personnel prohibit the administration of that medication for patients believed to be suffering from “excited delirium,” as Boyd was, according to the lawsuit.

> In court filings, county lawyers said the officers used reasonable force and that their actions did not cause Boyd’s death. The county also said they had probable cause to detain Boyd for an emergency evaluation.


> The state’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner found that Boyd’s death was likely caused by intoxication with the drug N-Ethylpentylone, also known as “bath salts.” The medical examiner concluded that it was unlikely that restraint by police officers caused or significantly contributed to his death.

The woman told officers Boyd was acting crazy and was under the influence of marijuana and alcohol, reports CBS Baltimore.

Not a break in?

>When police responded, the found Boyd and his fiancee screaming at each other, the station reports.

> According to a police report obtained by The AP, the confrontation with police began after Boyd repeatedly banged on the door of a neighbor’s home and officers tried to pull him away to keep him from going inside.

Wait, so he was the guy breaking attempting to break into his neighbor's house? 

Based on what I'm reading, if I'm understanding correctly, Tawon Boyd didn't call the Baltimore PD about a break in, the Baltimore PD was called about a break in that Boyd was *committing*?

> Police say Boyd appeared “confused and paranoid.” They say he also ran to several police cars, trying to get inside.

> Police say they tried taking the man in for an emergency evaluation, but he wouldn’t comply and began fighting officers. He allegedly refused to obey orders to lie down and put his hands on his back, and began grabbing and kicking officers, injuring three of them, police said.

It's impossible to know the truth here, but even based on the lawyer for the deceased's own words, it doesn't sound like Boyd was concerned about someone breaking into his own house, but someone else calling 911 about Boyd committing the break in.

Look, I'm not going to defend the police action specifically, but at the least this image is presenting an absolutely false context, and that I won't be quick to judge the officers involved in this specific incident with rash judgement."

The Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers are not obligated to protect civilians, and when a new case made it to the Supreme Court to challenge the ruling and hopefully overturn it, they upheld their decision.



The initial case that led to the initial ruling was one in which a woman had a domestic protection order against her ex ( these types of orders also prohibit contract any children the couple may have). He showed up at her home and kidnapped their three daughters who were playing outside, and she called the police. A police officer was not dispatched. He then called her, and in the course of the conversation ended up telling her where him and the children were. She called the police and begged them to go there and arrest him and bring her daughters back to her ( not only had he legally kidnapped the children, even being around them was a violation of protection order and should have led to his arrest) the next day all three of their daughters bodies were found in the man's trunk. Her and her family attempted to sue the Police Department, lost in court (because the courts will **ALWAYS** support their enforcers) and the case eventually made it to the Supreme Court where they ruled that police are not constitutionally obligated to protect civilians.

(https://www.barneslawllp.com/blog/police-not-required-protect)



The case that caused the Supreme Court to uphold their initial ruling is even more insane due to the fact that the police officers were actually there to witness the violence first and and chose not to intervene. There had been a spree of stabbings on the New York Subway system oh, and police officers were dispatched to ride the trains. Two officers watched from inside the locked Engineers cabin as the man they were looking for attacked and stabbed another passenger multiple times. The victim managed to wrestle the man to the ground and disarmed him despite his wounds, and once the attacker was disarmed and restrained, the police officers finally left the locked engineer's cabin and made the arrest. The man attempted to sue the NYPD, and of course the courts defended them.

707,evf12l,">An autopsy found that Boyd's death was likely caused by drugs, and ""unlikely that restraint by law enforcement caused or significantly contributed to his death. The drug (N-Ethylpentylone), a type of synthetic cathinone, which is commonly referred to as ""bath salts,"" was found in his body. The medical examiner's office ruled his death accidental.

Yeah dude it's pretty unlikely beating someone unconscious and drugging them without consent would possibly kill them

Also from a study on the effects on haldol

>A total of 70 of IV haloperidol-associated QTP and/or TdP were identified. There were 54 reports of TdP; 42 of these events were reportedly preceded by QTP. When post-event QTc data were reported, QTc was prolonged >450 msec in 96% of cases. Three patients experienced sudden cardiac arrest. Sixty-eight patients (97%) had additional risk factors for TdP/prolonged QT, most commonly receipt of concomitant proarrhythmic agents. Patients experiencing TdP received a cumulative dose of 5 mg to 645 mg, patients with QTP alone received a cumulative dose of 2 mg to 1540 mg.

Also a TL;DR on the FDA report

>ROCKVILLE, Md., Sept. 18 -- The FDA has issued a safety alert warning physicians that haloperidol (Haldol) given intravenously or at higher than recommended doses may increase the risk of cardiovascular events including sudden death, QT prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes.

Further reading in the report tells us this

>The FDA urged particular caution in treating patients with any formulation of haloperidol if they have other QT-prolonging conditions, including electrolyte imbalance (particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia); have underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, or familial long QT syndrome; or are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval.

Cannabis is known the prolong the QT interval, which the police and paramedics absolutely knew he was on at the time since he actually told them himself. Knowing that it was dangerous to administer it to him, just with cannabis alone in his system, let alone anything else they couldn't be bothered testing for, they still gave him a potentially lethal anti-psychotic. That's not an accidental death. It took me 2 minutes to find that information, there's no excuse for them"

Treatment must be by a patient's fully informed consent only (or implied consent only if they are unconscious and literally unable to consent and are at risk of further harm)."

The police exist only to enforce the laws that are put in place by politicians. There is no question that these politicians serve the interests of wealthy corporations and wealthy billionaires, and there is no question that these laws only target people who are poor.



I'll give you a quick example. One of President Nixon's aids (Erlichmann) went public years after the administration ended with the information that the War on Drugs that Nixon escalated (he is also responsible for calling it  The War on Drugs) was aimed at targeting black people to destabilize the civil rights movement, and also at the hippie counterculture movement that was actively protesting the Vietnam War. The drug war is not about a safety issue, if it was about safety we would be seeking treatment and other methods that show enormous success overseas instead of criminalizing drug use. It is about keeping the poor where they are and feeding the multi-billion dollar a year prison industrial complex.


As for traffic laws being enforced, there are enforced through tickets. Those tickets are been taken care of either with fines, or court fees. They serve only to enrich the judicial system, and such matters are not an issue for wealthy people.

Who should you call? Yourself, friends, and family. That's all you got, you have to be prepared to protect yourself because that's all you can trust in. 

Police officers are not lawyers, disciplined military, psychologists, or enlightened philosophers. Police are random human beings given enormous power which goes more or less unchecked, and they have to deal with dangerous and hard to manage people all day every day.

That's easy, extortion.

Looks there's the propaganda answer and the real answer. 

The propaganda answer is that police exist to protect and serve citizens. 

The real answer is that they exist to protect capital and grow America's reserve of slave labor. The thirteenth amendment to the constitution allows for slavery only as punishment for a crime, which is why prison population immediately shot up afterwards and why we have the highest percentage of people in prison of any country in the world. More prisoners per capita than China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, etc.

Moving on from there, that's not at all with the article say, and asserting that black people use more drugs than white people is absolutely fucking absurd. It's simply not the case and the data definitely backs that up, but let me stop you in your tracks before you ask for a source on that because you literally just got several sources and didn't even bother to read them so I'm not going to waste my time.



If you have read the sources, it would have been absolutely clear immediately even just from reading the headlines of the Articles gives you a good idea, but if you had actually read them you would have seen where the War on Drugs was literally started to target black people and the Civil Rights Movement. If you were incapable of understanding why that's problematic, then you'd have to be just about one of the dumbest people on the face of the planet, but I now know this isn't the case, you're just a bad faith actor.

Equal rights and duties?

Above all, undertake to ensure a decent living wage and earning a livelihood?

The right to choose laws and representatives to belong only to citizens?

Profit sharing in industries?

Increase in old-age pensions?

Nationalization of all trusts?

Religious freedom for all religious faiths in the state as long as they do not interfere with the states existence?


That’s a third of their manifesto that I agree with, and that I believe most people do, or should agree with.

The transatlantic slave trade was the biggest slave trading system, and slaves were being sent mostly to colonies of Spain, Portugal and France, which were Catholic countries. The English also participated, and at the time the ones in the colonies were mostly Protestant I think. 

In fact, the first big slave revolt was when the slaves in Haiti (a French colony) put their far superior numbers to use and took out the slavers."

Just want to note that, as the Wikipedia article /u/eisagi linked says, the phrase ""the exception proves the rule"" doesn't mean anything close to what you are suggesting, though it is commonly misused that way (and exists in other languages as well, such as my native language Swedish, where it is misused just as frequently).

The example the article brings up is very easy to understand. A sign saying ""no parking on Sundays"" is the exception proving the rule. Because saying no parking on Sundays would be *unnecessary* if parking *wasn't* allowed on other days of the week, the exception proves the rule regarding parking on other days, namely that it is allowed.

Also, unrelated to the actual grammar rules (such as modal verbs, etc.) I hate the whole der/das/die-thing you guys got going on, especially when it doesn't make sense (der Junge, das Mädchen is my personal pet peeve)."

And then they claim those 100k died from typhus and Nazis tried to save Jews from typhus using gas to kill lice.

And there are some bad comedies with flat humor making fun of nazis, so game with similarly easy condemnation of naziism by satirical and critical depiction is OK.  
Every game officially released in stores needs a FSK(like ersb just more relaxed with Sex n titties but less so with violence.) so before that decision the fsk would've told em to censor the fame- or get a court to make a decision.
Now the game will get looked at also on how it treats the symbols, the context in which they are used etc.

If the Nazis weren’t such brain dead racists then they would have realised their violent actions would have consequences for future racial movements like yours. But see you they didn’t care at the end and didn’t put much thought into it just like they didn’t put much thought when they invaded Russia. You say the Nazis are chimps because they rely on instinct, not reason.

I’ve wondered why Hitler killed the Jews. I did more research and read about how Nazis also murdered Gypsies. Why Gypsies? Do Gypsies spread communism or control the banks? Do they have secret organisations where they gather around to discuss how to best destroy the ‘Aryan’ race? Do they control the media? No one thinks that. 

Gypsies and Jews. Such completely different people, but so alike. One accused of being criminals, underachievers and unsuccessful and the other accused of being overachievers and too unsuccessful to the point of controlling and ruling everything. So different yet so alike. Can you spot the similarities? Maybe once you do then you will realise racism is not based on reason."

And no one takes them seriously. The most comprehensive and well sourced study about GLF deaths was by a Chinese researcher which was in fact censored in China, and it concluded there were 36 million deaths, as opposed to official archives indicate 15 million deaths. 80 million is bullshit. 

>Also evidence suggest that Stalin mass murdered over 20million people

That's also wrong and relies on saying he ""murdered"" pretty much every person that died for whatever reason, and it's all a bullshit attempt to whitewash Hitler. That number is higher than all the famines and everyone who died in a gulag for whatever reason and people who died earlier than average who were imprisoned in gulags combined.

1377,h10lbj,"Sorry, you lost me at the ""not against fascism"" part."
1378,h10lbj,"This feels like bait...... but OKAY!

The answer is simple because the premise is flawed, there are so many other questions that would need to be answered before one could answer your question: 

1. ""Why did this situation get to a riot status?"" 
2. ""Is it worth risking the health or lives of people involved to stop the ""riot?"" 
3. ""Can we give the ""rioters"" anything to make them stop ""rioting?""

In the case about this post, the answers are: 

1. ""The demands of the public had not been met after years of lobbying, awareness and peaceful demonstrations.""
2. ""No.""
3. ""Pass the reforms they are asking for.""

So, in conclusion, even if this girl was ""rioting"" she still did not deserve to die. Which, we have to remember, that the rioters and the protesters are not the same people.

Now, before we ""same sides"" this, it's important to remember what the goals and ideals behind the original protest are; police reform and preservation of life.

Why then, if they were fascists, might someone like myself might not care if a similar incident happened? Two things about that, one, I would care, at least a little, because the group I want reformed would be the police and their use of force. Two, cops are an essential part of a fascist state, and I would question how we would even get into that scenario. We have seen the police completely ignore and in some cases coordinating with White Nationalists."
1379,h10lbj,"First of all ""but you didn't want to kill people."". That should be the default attitude in every situation. There are very few situations where lethal force, after all other methods are exhausted, is ever justified. If you want to kill people you turn a riot into a battle or even a civil war. So beyond that being a morally repugnant attitude it is also strategicly stupid.

With that out of the way, you are asking the wrong question. How exactly does the riot look, exactly what are the rioters doing? How many are they? Where are they rioting? Why is there a riot? What is it about? When a riot took place alot has gone wrong before that. Chances are the authorities have failed before that riot ever took place. These questions are also relevant because they are all factors in how the riot should be responded to. Some riots are relatively easy to deescalate, others are much more dangerous and delicate to deal with."

secondly social workers would be used to discuss with people to deescalate certain situations or to check on people. I would reform the prison system as well to something similar to what Sweden currently has as prison is the only punishment that should be given for breaking the law.

My idea is that humans aren't bad we just make fuck ups sometimes and I feel like It's society that creates violence indirectly via the screwing over of various group and causing certain individuals to lash out due to personal issues caused by our society's toxic dehumanizing environment.

There is one thing I believe was “lost in translation” though. The hypothetical I bring up is supposed to be completely unattached from the situation above. It’s not flawed so much as lacking details, because I didn’t want to bog the question down. I suppose if I had to though...

1. The situation got riot status because people are causing property damage. No intentional harm to people, but sometimes it happens. The motives behind it are simply wanting to cause a riot. Let’s say their football team lost.

2. It’s up to you to decide if it’s worth the risk. Might as well say that Antifa is in power for this hypothetical situation.

3. The rioters are willing to stop if you all step down from your positions of leadership, let them form a council that decides on all government policy, give them each a mansion, and strike last night’s football game from all records."
1414,h10lbj,"Naturally not killing should be the default. Still, I felt it was important to include just for clarification. Part of that’s because I don’t know what your general mindset is. For instance, would you kill fascists? You seem alright with violence in that situation, but not sure how far you would go.

I do not believe I asked the wrong question. I simply did not fill in specifics. I was rather hoping for answers that would look at multiple possibilities. But I’m mainly looking at how people here would solve a situation where force of some kind seems necessary and the rioters are both widespread and unreasonable. 

Once again, this is not meant to be connected to any current situation. I’m only interested in how you all think, not convincing people. Although dealing with the suspicion/hostility, reasonable as it may be, is somewhat tiresome, so I’ll probably stop focusing on replying pretty soon."

1424,h10lbj,"I agree about the prostitutions however I believe there should be a greater power in police. They are there to protect people and stop criminals from hurting others. The problem with your replacement for guns is that in America the police would be outgunned as the public has access to fire arms so the people who are protecting us will be outgunned.

I also agree that all police should carry tasers and non lethals however due to the current laws of America I believe the police should carry firearms at least pistols. For I see how scary it can be for a police office in situation which can result in harm from weapons or even death for “those who put their life on the line for others”. End of the day all criminals should be put to justice

I also don’t agree that humans fuck up, that there are naturally evil humans (most famously Hitler, Stalin, etc) that do just want to progress by putting others down and enforcing their way of life. There I don’t agree that some people will comply with councillors or help from others, which can be led by greed and manipulation. 

Even on the subject of people fucking up, it’s an almost inevitable thing that at least one person will hate on another due to the difference of that person and unfortunately it will never end, however true suppression is the key in my eyes. Of course that violates the right of free speech and will show hypocrisy in the alignment of anti fascism.

On the prison note what would you say are the best ways to rehabilitate people in prison. I don’t think prisoners should live in terrible conditions, however people who kill or rape should not be given the a high status of living in prison as a punishment, that’s just my view on it at the moment as I feel justice is not served. What about your view?

Besides, there are always many, many more people who peacefully protest than people who riot. So how do you ""reward"" the people who did it the peaceful way? Tell them it's not going to happen because a bunch of opportunists did some property damage?"
1432,h10lbj,"This is probably a trap. I've seen it before. The intent is to go an endless number of comments deep with ""curiousity"" and politeness mired in presumptions and false premises. 

Fascists feigning ignorance and curiosity. It bogs down those of us who answer the other bullshit their teammates are spewing elsewhere. 

I'll still roughly answer, but I doubt there's value in continuing past here. 

Football riot: 

Monitor and contain the situation. Arrest the people committing violence. Arrest property damagers if you have the capacity. Follow up on the riot with investigations to see if you missed anyone, and then prosecute them as well. 

It's genuinely that simple. 

Tear gas is a pre-emptive strike. It is meant to disperse a crowd. It doesn't stop individual acts of property damage or violence either. It can also escalate the situation. At *best* it ends the riot sooner. 

No riot even comes *remotely close* to other types of natural disasters that our society is already equipped to withstand. 

Just monitor the situation. Set up barricades in a logical manner, and wait for it to die down, because it will. 

They don't happen often."
1433,h10lbj,"You missed the core part of the explanation. All three questions must be answered and pertain to the situation at hand. In your hypothetical, a football team lost, which started the riots, but then Antifa showed up? A group against Facists? For a football game? Then Antifa, a group or people, who aren't really organized, who are against violent authoritarianism, want to seize power? Fascism is an undermining of Democratic values and consolidation of power in an ever-decreasing amount of people, and Anti-Fascists are against that.

The biggest problem with your hypothetical is none of it makes any sense. Your hypothetical is like suggesting that the civil rights movement was to overthrow white people and install black people in positions of power."
1434,h10lbj,"The trick with policing is to prevent things from escalating in the first place. I can't say more as vague as you are. I don't know what you even think is a situation that necessitates violence. I have no frame of reference for what you mean when you say something like that. I can't look into your head. I also don't know what you would consider unreasonable. Once again I can not look into your head.

What are you looking for? What do you want to know?

If you want to know someones thoughts on a matter you gotta ask a concise question pertaining to reality. We're not in Philosophy 101 debating the trolley problem or ""what is truth?"" here.

It's this kind of vagueness by the way that leads to the hostility you've experienced. This kind of extremely vague theoretical inquiry just smells like the kind of set up often used by right wing trolls to sealion people and set them up for some Ben Shapiro style sophistry.

And ""this is not connected to any current situation?"". That comes of as insincere. In the middle of the biggest protest movement in a long time, under a post about someone getting killed by the police in Said protests, you ask about antifascists thoughts on when it is okay to use force in riot situations and you want to tell us this is completely unrelated and purely theoretical for you?"

cruelty breeds cruelty, I know the first response to these types of people who are twisted like a landscape of hellfire and river of blood and entrails would be to make their lives a living hell but all your doing is twisting them further into an abominable monstrosity. vengeance brings emptiness after it passes and why become the monster in the process when you can kill the idea of it and save a person from becoming that way and hurting people."
1448,h10lbj,"The first amendment protects speech and assembly when it does not countermand other laws, like not obstructing the free passage of others. If you've ever been arrested during a peaceful protest that included civil disobedience, you should know that--you would have been informed of the law you broke, read your rights, arested and processed, and you would have hearings of some sort related to those specific charges. The civil rights era civil disobedience disregarded laws that were clearly immoral. But there's nothing immoral about laws against blocking traffic or failing to disperse from an area where you do not have a permit to protest. That's still civil disobedience and the *reason* for it in this case is immoral--no one is arguing in favor of police brutality--but not the law itself. You'd likely not be happy with people blocking your path just for gits and shiggles.  
  
The problem with your example is no matter how immoral the people who protested with guns for haircuts are, they literally didn't break any laws except failure to social distance and not congregate in groups of more than 100--laws everyone is breaking. The public is allowed in that state capitol and, believe it or not, they are allowed to carry guns in there. The problem is with the law--there was no law to enforce there--except the law against letting gun-toting members of the public into the actual state chambers instead of the lobby, which was enforced. Michigan will likely change some laws after that debacle, but the point that they have to is . . . the point.
  
So if someone was gassed as a result of failure to clear an area they did not have a permit to be protesting in, you can rightly criticize the tactics but they did break a law, and you're literally comparing people who broke the law with people who didn't. Of course everyone gets that you're comparing immoral people with moral ones, but the law doesn't do that, and we should be glad for that, because then morality would be defined with the vagaries of elections."
1449,h10lbj,">Doing one's own research isn't a difficult task

..... the irony....."
1450,h10lbj,"Thanks. Your answer in regards to the hypothetical makes a lot of sense.

Do you get “polite fascists” often? If their goal is to just bog you down, why wouldn’t they also be rude? What would the goal of “bogging down” people like you be? And if it’s all bullshit, wouldn’t the polite people be just as worth answering as the rude stuff? Couldn’t you just ignore that too?

As for me, suppose there’s not really a way to prove I’m not part of a coordinated effort unless nothing else goes on while I’m chatting. Far as words go though, I just enjoy finding out about the perspectives of other people. Personally, I believe reality to be a lot like a statue. Everyone has there own view of this statue, and sometimes that view creates misconceptions. But every person’s view holds at least some truth in that, from the position they’re in, that view is what you get. So I believe by examining multiple views a person might slowly gain a better understanding of this statue representing reality.
 
One last question about your post though. What natural disasters are our society equipped to withstand that are more damaging than riots? I would agree that measures are taken against natural disasters, but typically if they cause significant damage I wouldn’t see the situation as perfectly equipped for."
1451,h10lbj,"No. Antifa is in power in this hypothetical. They’re the ones that need to decide what to do. The football rioters are just some random group that’s causing trouble.

This is not an analogy. The rioters aren’t a stand in for anything. This is solely to ask how, if you were in a position where you needed to handle a riot, you would go about doing it."
1452,h10lbj,"I believe part of the problem is I don’t know your guys’ heads either. It’s kind of why I’m asking. I want to make the question something vague and in a vacuum because, if I don’t, I’m very likely to set people off for reasons I’m unaware of. Heck, simply being polite while asking questions has at least one person suspicious I’m part of some kind of alt-right tag team. I also believe if I ask too detailed a question certain parts would go unanswered. 

Yes, this question is not meant to be linked to any current situation. I wanted to find out what the Antifa crowd would do in a situation where rolls are reversed, but disassociated from current political issues. Basically, if members of this subreddit ran a country, how would they maintain order when things got dicey. By declaring it separate from current issues I hoped to limit answers to my question and not have people accusing me of holding an opinion on current matters I either don’t hold or am keeping to myself. The reason it’s under this story is that I thought of the question while reading it. I also figure that a question about policing under a story about policing was appropriate.

I checked out sealioning and believe it cleared up some confusion for me. It seems my dropping by was a larger mistake than I had thought. I expected to be treated suspiciously and possibly rudely. I’m used to talking to people with views quite different from mine, including those who deal with a lot of negativity from outsiders. Typically being civil is enough to have a decent conversation with those willing to have it. But it appears my typical approach is rather directly looked down on. 

Anyways, I do this for my amusement. I typically enjoy finding people willing to talk about their views on things. Sometimes I enjoy feeding trolls too, as I find being online is the perfect environment for practice maintaining my emotional composure under stress. But I know my limits, and dealing with people thinking I’m sealioning sounds like an endeavor I’d much rather avoid. Thanks for your time and some new topics to think about."

1457,h10lbj,"I see. So a police officer using tear gas to disperse a crowd but instead killing a protester is tantamount to the Nazis using cyanide gas to kill 6 million men, women, and children--including infants in their mothers' arms, in order to exterminate an entire people. Got it.

And rest in power instead of rest in peace. What does that mean?"
1458,h10lbj,"Not just nukes. If you start using tear gas, your enemy will retaliate with their own chemical weapons. It could be more tear gas, or it could be sarin.

By asking me specifically what I'd do is trap. I'm by no means am a ""representative"" no one really is. Everybody would have a different opinion on what to do. 

This is what I'm trying to explain to you when I tell you your premise is flawed."
1462,h10lbj,"There is a big misunderstanding about what Antifa is on your part.

Antifa is a movement. It is a loose association and coalition of people who are willing to oppose fascism with direct action whereever it rears its ugly head.

A little bit of history does not hurt here. Antifascism has its roots in antifascist organisations in Italy in the 20ies. The red and black flag and the name Antifa come from the Antifaschistische Aktion in Germany in the 30ies. A coalition of communists and anarchists who got together on a local level, temporarily and with no permanent organisation, to oppose fascism through direct action.

That is where the movement comes from. It is not a party and not an organisation that wants to get into power.

What you find here in this sub is an even broader coalition of people who get together for that purpose. Just looking at the flairs people use here, you'll see quite a spectrum from social democrats to socialists to communists to anarchists. Personally I use the Iron Front flair as you can see, because I come from the political environment that this antifascist organisation came from. Hell as things shake out right now you probably even have the odd liberal hanging around here by now.

So the people in this sub would never run a country together. We have differing opinions on how that should be done and this isn't this movements purpose.

The purpose is simple. Oppose fascism and prevent fascists from taking and consolidating power. That is an effort that has to ideally start early when you can contain and politicly isolate fascists easily.

So yeah the roles won't ever be switched. Antifa is not an organisation with that purpose. It isn't even an organisation. It is a movement and a coalition. At most temporarily and loosely organized at a local level. Hierarchies can be abused, coopted and targeted."
1463,h10lbj,"The problem is that the LAPD has such a terrible past with racism and lying to cover up their own crimes that I legitimately can’t trust their word on [Dorner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Dorner_shootings_and_manhunt).

Would it be so crazy if Dorner really was one of the good guys and got hunted down by corrupt police?  

Note: I’m not saying Dorner was right, just that it’s really hard to believe the LAPD’s story after they hunted a black officer for days and eventually set fire to a cabin he was hiding in. Also, his “manifesto” stated that he was fired for reporting excessive force by the LAPD. Maybe we need some new eyes on his allegations given what we know about policing."

I’m not saying either one was a conspiracy, just that both are really crazy events and the actual information on it is very sparse. The 9/11 report missing all the information on Saudi involvement is a great example of information that was withheld for years, and that’s what the lack of information about other events looks like, even if that’s an incorrect assumption. The optics aren’t great. 

We, the citizenry, need an independent investigative body to focus on all allegations of police misconduct and has the power to remove bad cops at every level. We also need police body cams to be on 100% of the time and that data transferred to secure storage at the end of every shift, with a “dual key” encryption scheme so the police can’t even view their own footage without a password from the Investigation division. Any missing footage should be considered proof of wrongdoing for any allegations, as a way of enforcing the constant usage by police. Finally, we need the police to focus on rebuilding the public’s trust through systemic changes and spotless reporting of all events good or bad. Otherwise they’re just going to end up as a localized paramilitary group."

1728,gu2nul,"Fascism is a political ideology defined by social and political authoritarianism and ultra-nationalism. This is supported by ferocious anti-liberalism, anti-socialism and a violently exclusionist expansionist agenda. It also espouses a corporatist economic system.

The nationalist element is core to fascism as it sees the nation as the key societal element and the strenghth of that nation is paramount to the exclusion of virtually all else. To further this fascism always paints ""its group"" as the hard done by victim and ties up an individuals self esteem into the greater glory and achievments of the group. This links back into the corporatist economic ideas of fascism.

Fascism is not just ""being nasty to people you don't agree with"" or ""violence"" as the state has the authority of violence yet we do not call it fascist."

1828,gu2nul,"Fascism is a political ideology defined by social and political authoritarianism and ultra-nationalism. This is supported by ferocious anti-liberalism, anti-socialism and a violently exclusionist expansionist agenda. It also espouses a corporatist economic system.

The nationalist element is core to fascism as it sees the nation as the key societal element and the strenghth of that nation is paramount to the exclusion of virtually all else. To further this fascism always paints ""its group"" as the hard done by victim and ties up an individuals self esteem into the greater glory and achievments of the group. This links back into the corporatist economic ideas of fascism.

Fascism is not just ""being nasty to people you don't agree with"" or ""violence"" as the state has the authority of violence yet we do not call it fascist."

Basically this is a tool that his supporters will use to justify violence against protesters but legally/officially it will go nowhere.

It might have made sense if he decided he was adding groups like the KKK or other white supremacist groups who literally hate and want to spread fear to other groups of people.

1967,gzm4bb,"It's something you see with power hierarchies in general, not just fascism. You pick a group that doesn't have much power politically/economically/socially and then you blame them for all the problems in society  (catholics, Jews, muslims, lgbt, minorities, women, etc) since they can't fight back. They are useful as scapegoats, but the second it looks like they could actually get any real power from you, they must be eliminated or crushed back into submission. You can always find or even create a new scapegoat to take their place, like how conservatives made abortion and drugs into a big issue in the US since Reagan."

2031,gzm4bb,"the power positions in soviets and the larger government were elected. obviously that doesnt automatically mean it meets the actual ideal of democracy the same way america doesnt, but its not really like they just said 'fuck all yall we in charge now'. although it is my (quite limited) understanding that in terms of direct individual power over their personal workplace that idea was done for.

this was also in a very difficult time, war and starvation and such, and they werent necessarily trying to make the perfect system so much as scramble to get a base line set up so things like grain can be distributed to where the hungry people are.

if i have a point, which i usually dont, its that history cant be understood as a perfect unfolding of theory, or even as being a divergent break from that perfect unfolding. history happens one step at a time, its the gross mangled imperfect unfolding of an immanent reality pushing and growing itself out. instead of 'it was bad because they missed these marks we set', the focus should be understanding what they were responding to, how they responded to it (as a matter of amoral historic fact), and what we can learn from that so as to respond better in the future.

and also + /u/spireswagon

2035,gzm4bb,"That is a gross misunderstanding of what Democratic Centralism refers to, as well as the aristocratic form of economy.

For one democratic centralism means only that as far as government policy is concerned, full and free debate is accepted but that once a course of action democratically is decided upon it is expected that everyone in the government despite their misgivings support and enforce it.
Prior to Stalin Democratic Centralism was a reality in the Soviet Union, eventually as his bureacratic clique took more and more power the principle of Democratic Centralism faded away.

As for Russia being ""fundamentally aristocratic"", well I suppose it makes for a fancy insult if not one grounded in reality. An aristocracy implies that the bureacrats owned the workplaces -- they did not -- and that the workers had a serf relation to the workers, i.e. that the workers possessed some land or means of production and were obligated to turn over a majority of their production to their lords -- again obviously inaccurate.
The Bureacracy as degenerated as it was in the Soviet Union did not own the factories or land, they were essentially a sort of management of the state owned land, and even their grip on it was subject to political struggle between the upper and lower bureaucracy, and the people of the soviet union as well."

even taking the history as you portray it for granted (for the sake of discussion), im guessing these named people werent walking around like ""lol we need to murder more people, bring murder to britain today!"". they were journalists and such. this isnt a moral gray zone, and i think its suspect to have a knee jerk anti-communist response to that being brought up."

By mentioning antifa, Trump has effectively driven the trump-hating liberals further left and brought out more online support for the movement than we've seen in quite some time.  

There is a lot of misinformation being pushed, sure, but there's also a lot of people providing well-researched corrections and additionally educating moderates about the movement. Conservatives are pissed, sure, but there's no way we were going to convince them anyway.

I would never, ever tell anyone to vote for Biden but now people have to. Trump is actively taking steps towards assuming dictatorial powers and he must be opposed in every way possible."
2053,gufidi,"The thing is though: the antifascists never stopped fighting. And while Hitler was very much beloved amongst the oligarchs I am not so sure about Trump. Not because they're good people but because the is a threat to the stock market. So I somewhat doubt that he will stay president. But even if he didn't: if he iniates to basically eliminate freedom of speech then I heavily doubt that Biden would reverse it when he became president.

The war is not lost by declaring us illegal. Of course it will make things more difficult. But just think about how many people fought in the resistance. Even in 36 hundreds of German resistance fighters went off to Spain to fight for democracy. The battle never stopped. And the people who freed France were basically the local antifa who took arms against the nazis.

I'm not saying that we should stay optimistic. I'm trying to say that we must not lose hope when this becomes law. We must not waste a thought about other politicians saving us from that. Because rights are never granted. They have to be fought for. And this is actually also a message all of the left should agree with: from social democrat, to Maoist, to Leninist, to anarchist. We must never rely on others to save our skin. Only in a united front against fascism we can actually succeed. 

And that's the most important thing right now in the US: we need to stick together. Let our ideologies take second position. We can fight each other once fascism is defeated. But the situation is dire. And while we all have variously different beliefs we all believe in fighting fascism.

I'm usually not a big fan of the ""left unity"" concept but it's not about party vs people right now. It's the survival of minorities and at least some democracy against fascism. And that's where everyone needs to stand behind. I know that that's already the case in the most part. I just want to remind ourselves that we must unite for fighting fascism. Politicians won't free us from fascism. Only we the people can.

The world is watching the US right now. And be reminded that we stand with you against fascism all over the world."

2055,gufidi,"You don't have to convince us that Trump is bad. You have to convince us that voting for Joe Biden would do anything to stop the inexorable March towards fascism. Four years of Biden's brand of elitism would do nothing but increase the very anger that got Trump elected. Except, in 2024, it will be someone a lot worse than Trump. Someone who actually knows what they are doing. A fascist with plan.

And then we will be really screwed."
2056,gufidi,"And you dare to call me a terrorist

While you looked down your gun

When I think of all the deeds that you had done

You had plundered many nations divided many lands

You had terrorised their peoples you ruled with an iron hand

And you brought this reign of terror to my land"
2057,gufidi,"It means that any protester arrested can be slapped with the ""Antifa"" label and treated like a terrorist, which means you can kiss your due process goodbye."
2058,gufidi,"According to an [official statement by the ACLU](https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1267148165796507650?s=20), Trump literally does not have the power to do this. For now, we're safe"
2059,gufidi,"This is the worst time for this to happen, my dad is high risk; I can't go out and it kills me. I've felt to ashamed I've been cutting myself again, I am literally unable to stand with my community against the cops and other fascist/white supremacist organizations and I want to die right now. I will never forgive myself for not being helpful, if you are not high risk, not living with someone who is high risk, and not a bigoted sack of shit get in the fucking streets, stand with protestors and stand with your community. Join organizations like the Socialist Rifle Association, John Brown Gun Club and your local anti-fascist group."
2060,gufidi,Solution : change the name of the ideology
2061,gufidi,KKK is a terrorist group and the government doesnt crack down on those fucks.
2062,gufidi,"By naming a non-group with no registered membership and no leaders in this manner, they can arrest pretty much anyone under terror laws. Think about that. Attending a protest, commenting on this sub or 'like'ing a post could be used as justification for indefinite detainment."
2063,gufidi,"14 characteristics of facism:
https://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html

We meet about 12/14. 
If Trump wins again, we'd know it's a sham and his rants on Twitter about the election says a lot.

We should be more organized and tactical. Well prepared and supplied with shields, barricades, etc."
2064,gufidi,"Antifa doesn't have structures nor members per se, therefore it isn't an organisation. It's something you identify with, a mindset. It is physically impossible to declare that a terrorist organisation. Orangedolf won't do shit.

Still, for God's sake, don't back down my comrades across the ocean. Keep fighting."

2066,gufidi,"Hate to be a party pooper, but regarding Germany as a beacon of hope is kinda meh. The Afd, a far right party, got 12,6% of the votes in the last federal election (which was in 2017)"
2067,gufidi,"Finally someone in the know speaking up. His whole Presidency has been about manipulating the masses to install himself as a dictator, this is exactly what Hitler was trying to achieve and Putin has recently done the same thing.
The firings and manipulation of good people in government and installing his cronnies, the racist undertones that he sends out, the creation of “fake news” to undermine the media and establish a cult like base, the wall/the NFL knee/the signalling to the neo nazis at his rallies/the signalling to the neo nazis in Charlottesville/the signalling to the protestors in Minnesota/the China flu to establish racism and divide and increase racial tensions in the hopes of civil unrest, the pumping up of the economy to pour money into the rich and powerful hands so they don’t side against him, the lack of COVID response and demand to open everything up to create a massive emergency situation in a couple of months, the creation of the mail in ballots fraud issue which now gives him free reign to say the election results are illegitimate if he doesn’t win, the inaction on the race riots to enact a law that anyone against his agenda is a domestic terrorist.
We were taught about Nazis and fascism in school to ensure Hitler never happened again but here we are 80 years later and people aren’t seeing this shit. It’s here again, wake up! This is absolutely terrifying."

As someone who’s seen as more “right” leaning, I whole heartedly agree with you and think that labeling ANTIFA a terrorist organization is an insanely dangerous slippery slope. I wish yang tulsi or Biden got the DNC nomination"
2073,gufidi,"Flashback to 2000. 

""Bush and Gore are the same, I'm voting Nader / not voting / etc""

Gore probably would have continued a lot of status quo and was certainly the neo-liberal candidate. Would he have invaded Iraq just because his daddy did? Would he have been hosting the Bin-Laden family on the day of 9-11? Would he have done more about global warming?

One can imagine the cascading impact of simply not having done these disastrous things. 

Sure, they both don't get it. Still I am haunted by the echos of 2004's ""NoW wE HAvE A MaNDATE!!!"".  Don't give Trump's presidency a mandate."
2074,gufidi,"911 was a Reichtagsfire, this is the wave

911 was the destruction of evidence of 50 years of fascist dictatorships and cocaine trade by the OSS including under the auspices of ALLEN DULLES & GEORGE BUSH SR. who was CIA head when JFK was murdered by said cabal to not lose the flow of money that was cocaine. a network created by KLAUS BARBIE, PABLO ESCOBAR and ROBERTO SUAREZ GOMEZ under US/OSS auspices to fund the cold war. every fascist, every nazi was welcome and received funding, explosives, guns and training under PLAN CONDOR, GLADIO, STAYBEHIND, ERGENEKON, PROPAGANDADUE, e.t.c. many of the banks were at the wtcs as were the overseeing agencies and most their paper files & archives about to digitalized thx to a FOIA amendment under Clinton

There is no choice left other than dying of starvation and exposure to the elements."
2079,gufidi,"11/10 post. I’m a literature major that will eventually get a PhD with an emphasis on political rhetoric and utopian/dystopian fiction. I shared this on Facebook. Whenever people in class do projects on antifa being a hate group or whatever, I would speak up. It’s the little things that add up to stopping the big things."
2080,gufidi,"You’re wrong: not at all did all nazi leaders have to answer for their crimes. Many just kept their jobs and positions (judges, doctors, lawyers, teachers, you name it). And not at all did we heal from it. We call it “Entnazifizierung” - “Denazification” and it failed miserably. Fascism and right-wing politics are on the rise again and more people of colour are being killed. Please don’t reduce the complexity of historical and societal matters of Germany like that."

2083,gufidi,"Good luck comrades, from your comrades up north!"
2084,gufidi,"I really can’t imagine being on an anti-fascist board and having people claim that violence is not the answer. A diversity of tactics are always needed for revolutions to succeed, and that includes violence. Take the civil rights movement for example. Without violent protests, leaders of this country would never have accepted the demands of the peaceful protesters as an acceptable middle ground. When leaders and heads of state do not take peaceful protests seriously, it is violence that helps push them over the edge to reconsider what people are asking for. If we were back in colonial times, would you be willing to tell Native Americans that violence is not an acceptable means for pushing back against the murder and colonization of their people? Do you not understand how important it is to fight back with equal force *in some cases*? When you say “violence begets violence”, I reply that the state has enacted grievous violence against us, and so naturally that must beget violence from us in return. Does that mean you personally have to be violent? No. But do not deny that a diversity of tactics are required for revolution to be possible."
2085,gufidi,"About what you said about Germany, it's gotten far worse  concerning right wing activists. There's the NSU, Combat 18 Hells Angels Identitäre Bewegung Dritter weg AFD and so on. There are so many things  going wrong in this country. and the defense of constitution or the police and so on do not care, in the best case. it seems more as if anti-fascist are being watched and right wing activists are being protected. at least that's the sign they send on the streets.
there still are protests and anti fascists doing what has to be done. And tension strengthens for each event filled with repression anger and violence.

2096,gufidi,"Tiny note: both Italy and Germany still have *huge* problems with their fascist inheritance.
Yes, Germany has been much more vocal and clear in condemning its past under Hilter but it has been shown over and over that in terms of actual leadership and positions of power (both locally and statewide) most Nazi stayed in power after the war. Everyone simply ""forgot"" they had been Nazi.

While it is true that in Italy a similar thing has happens re people who were in power under Mussolini, it is also true that Mussolini was *deposed* during the war and that half the country faught with it's blood to have Fascists and Nazis out of the country.

Overall both countries were profoundly defined by their dictatorial times, and both constitutionally and politically are constructed on anti fascist principles. However, both countries have huge issues with their fascist past and it is unfair to say that one of the two dealt with it much better."

Small drones or quadcopters, and DIY IMSI catchers are effective for surveillance and tracking police movements"

Call me crazy but the second that lunatic started  attacking mail-in voting and claiming widespread voter fraud during a pandemic, I knew we were in deep. In my opinion he is terrified of it because he won the election with it. And now ANTIFA is terrorism? Because it scares him? I'm horrified and mad as hell.

About Mussolini’s grand-daughter she’s a piece of shit, too, but luckily she’s not too influent. 
Fuck violence, fuck war, fuck oppression and fuck hypocrisy. We all could live our lives focused on happiness, but power and money rule over us. Epicurus already knew that happiness is the ultimate goal of our life, but even after more than 2000 years, we can’t do anything about it."
2107,gufidi,"Fascinating how a president of the United States of America can call literal fascists ""very fine people"" and label the people standing up against them ""terrorists"".

Edit: a reminder for you all, stay safe out there if you're protesting, there's a lot of crazy shit going on and there's plenty more to come, we will not go down quietly"
2108,gufidi,"The problem is that antifa sounds like a terrorist organization. Better say antifascists directly. Its much easier to say im declaring antifa as a terrorist organization than say im declaring antifascism as a terrorist organization. The image of the movement is very important, and its important to take care of it."
2109,gufidi,"> Declaring the loose concept of being against Fascism to be terrorism is like what Hitler, did

As an apolitical outsider who got here from the front page, I wanted to share a few thoughts:

There's a pubic perception of Antifa, capital A, as an organization.  It's no different from how many still think Anonymous is an actual hacker group with leadership and a collective goal, and not an umbrella label and ideology that can be adopted by anybody.  It doesn't make it true, but the current branding fits with that narrative.

Likewise, this perception of ""Antifa"" being a singular organized group is what's being targeted, and the way the image is handled isn't really helping the public perception.  To the average joe, hearing ""Antifa"" draws up an immediate image of a bunch of crust punks in all black with a little red here and there, with bandannas over their mouths, waving red flags, and sometimes strapped with crude homemade armor or weapons.  Look at the google image search results for ""antifa"" and it's clear how this can appear to be a singular group to an outside observer, especially when compared to the image results for ""protest.""

From a governmental or law enforcement perspective, Antifa's branding is checking every box for an organized entity.  Look at how they identify and classify gangs: it comes down to colors, clothing, and symbols.  Antifa is easily recognizable in these regards, and it makes for such classification easy.

So just ditch the pseudo-uniforms and flags and boom, no terrorist organization.  Make things seem less organized.  Double down on the peaceful protests and organize to your heart's content, but make it seem more natural.  With less apparent unity in the way you market yourselves, you've suddenly changed the branding."
2110,gufidi,"Bunker Trump is attempting to make an idea illegal. its a movement with no central organization, and as OP stated, he's just by nature an anti fascists. Fucking declaring those who are against FASCISM as terrorists!!!  Let that sink in. He will use it, exploit it and expose it to his full advantage, trampling our right to protest and engage in free speech( i.e., any form of protest or disdain for trump or his system) along the way. Rise up people."
2111,gufidi,I would not be surprised if the protests were deliberately steered toward unrest as an excuse to clamp down big time. I saw so many blackwater looking dudes in the crowd that were 100% not protesting and just watching and waiting. The powers that be want the law and order excuse to ignore the protest blame it on whoever suits them and then apply boot to neck even further and get the national guard in as many blue states as they can. Much easier for systems of government to deal with light civil unrest than actually address the concerns of a peaceful protest... cant score political points squashing a non violent protest ... a stopping a riot on the other hand? That's political capitol you can cash in on the next election.
2112,gufidi,"I'm in line with everything besides the part where you talk about Germany. Denazification never was near to complete. 

Both left and right haven't overcome the future but forgot it."
2113,gufidi,Hey is it okay if I post this on Twitter? I’ll give credit to your reddit of course. I think this is something more people should see
2114,gufidi,We have the best opportunity in my lifetime to fundamentally turn the Democratic Party in our direction. If you can’t see this or don’t want to see it then I don’t know what to tell you. We have more socialists in the party ranks since the 30s and we risk squandering the moment. It’ll be a million times easier to turn the Democratic Party then it will be to get the DSA or another group to power.
2115,gufidi,"I would have made a joke fitting my username like ""the world is not his, but mine to rule and mine alone"" or something like that, but imo the situation is a bit too serious for that, good luck everyone"
2116,gufidi,Out of curiosity why do you think the election has already been stolen?
2117,gufidi,"I’ll add my small post of solidarity. A few days ago my wife went to a peaceful demonstration. Tonight, it sounds like a bunch of people looking for trouble are going out. We have kids, so we’re staying home. Both of us want to support the cause and struggle, but we also know that raising strong, mixed-race babies, who respect humans, and hate fascism is a form of support. So we’ll sit this one out. (But we sent some food and first aid supplies to some friends heading out) 

So yeah. We support you guys even if we aren’t always there."

So, we vote for Biden to get him out of office? That's the only thing I can really assume you mean, because there's no other way to get him out. No third party has a shot. 

I have my own major concerns about Biden getting in though, besides the obvious. Namely that if he gets elected, his administration will implement and reinforce the same awful neoliberal policies that led to the rise of Trump in the first place - leading to another right-populist figure taking power in 2024 after anger with the system boils over again.

Only this time it'll be someone more competent and adept at governing/getting legislation passed. Some legitimately fascist ghoul like Tom Cotton or another rising star in the Republican Party.

Bernie was the compromise candidate, Biden or any other neoliberal stooge they might replace him with will just lead to the same outcome as 2016 four years from now. I'd rather have another four years of an incompetent buffoon like Trump who often accidentally sabotages himself, than someone cold and calculated in 2024."
2122,gufidi,We still do business with Israel which was a big terrorist organization.
2123,gufidi,"As much as I despise Trump and the fascist movement that latches onto him, voting for Biden will not help.

Antifa, and workers' organisation in general, has always been suppressed. Whether it's blatant police bias during fascist riots or actual assassinations by state agents, the capitalist state will always work with fascism before it works against it. Even if Biden does reverse the declaration - which he could easily just *not do* \- it won't change anything, except that the US government might have a slightly more legal basis (if you can call it that) for suppression of anti-fascism. It's hardly like the US government has been limited by human rights like the rule-of-law in the past.

For that matter, Biden will not resolve the problem in the long term, because he *is* the problem. Fascism didn't just happen, it's a direct defensive reaction to the exposure of capitalism's faults, which have been raised by the last few decades of liberal rule.

Every year we aren't arguing for socialism as an alternative to capitalism - rather than an extension of it that we'd really like but can compromise on - is another year for fascism. Trump is already bad, and he's just a protofascist - imagine what would happen if fascism had another 4 years to grow.

Lastly, keep in mind that this is the *second* time that liberals have used Trump to coerce leftists into supporting them. What makes us think they won't keep doing it until we learn not to trust them? And what makes us think they won't end up sympathetic to the fash if it's profitable for them anyway (which it is - the fash are literally there to save their profits), as they've done in *every historical instance* and have already shown signs of doing (see: Bloomberg, Hillary ""we need more racism"" Clinton)?

There is no clear choice in this two-party election. There is a proto-fascist, and there is a liberal. But the antifascist choice is, as far as I can see, a scribble, or Howie, and the constant resistance we should always be doing."

Trump is not trying to make all the antifascist groups as terrorist groups.

2171,gufidi,"1.First of all, declaring antifa as a terrorist group isn't the same as declaring *being against facsim* terrorism. If antifa will be declared as a terrorist group, it will mean that people who will act in the name of antifa will be considered terrorists.

Yes, of course antifa isn't technically an organization since it has no offical leaders, but it is still a defined community of activism that has morals and values, which can be easily be argued to be a terrorist group based on the many actions people who associated themselves to antifa did.

Terrorism is the use of unlawful intentional violence against people for political reasons
or social objectives.
Even if one believes that antifa's violence is justified because the people being hurt are truly evil, it is still unlawful, intentional violence against people for political reasons; fighting against facsism.

If antifa will be passed as a terrorist group, people can still advocate against facsism as long as they don't associate themselevs with a terrorist group like antifa. Maybe start a group and call it ""Against Facsism"", and stop using the iconic symbolism of antifa. Oh, and no one will care of you're not violent.

2.Unlike the communist party in Germany, antifa isn't a political party in the us but more of an ambigous group of people who stand for fighting against facsism.

Also, this argument is extremely based, because from what I know people who associate themselves with antifa are usally anti-gun, and banning guns is one of the common decenst to facsism in the history of facsistic regiemes."
2172,gufidi,"I'd like to note, Antifa being marked as a terrorist group would mean anyone thought to be associated in Antifa's acts would have to be tried in military court (DC) rather than being tried locally for terrorism (or whatever charge may be brought).

If you've ever wondered ""what is my purpose in society as an artist, in the grand scheme of things?"", now's your chance to find out.  


We possess a passive ability that some might have a hard time realizing at first: our ability to communicate a message with no words. Be it a photo, a painting, a song, film, whatever medium is irrelevant. We can take our mediums and use it to express any message or concept we intend. A picture is worth a thousand words, after all.   


There is a reason that historically, artists are usually rounded up early on in a totalitarian/authoritarian government. They can control what messages are broadcast or published, but they cant control the meaning of art as defined by its creator. The inability to control an artist is exactly the reason they are so dangerous to an authoritarian government.   


SO I SAY TO ALL OF YOU ARTISTS, MUSICIANS, FILMMAKERS, ILLUSTRATORS, AND EVERYONE INBETWEEN:  


NOW IS THE TIME WHERE WE ARE NEEDED MOST.  


As artists, we naturally bring comfort to those around us. We give others a means of escape from the pains of life. We show them the beauty of life in even the worst of circumstances, and right now, the future looks bleak.

I've seen a lot of memes and a lot of really spicey tweets about Trump saying he plans to declare Antifa as a terrorist organization. I want to make it clear what this means. 

I am an academic who teaches and studies the rise and fall of Fascism. I am literally anti-fascist by trade. 

I'm more terrified now than at any point in my adult life. Here's why. 

On February 27th 1933 the main Chamber of the Reichstag was destroyed in a fire. Hitler almost immediately took this as an opportunity.

>This is a God-given signal! If this fire, as I believe, turns out to be the handiwork of Communists, then there is nothing that shall stop us now from crushing out this murderous pest with an iron fist.

It became illegal to be associated with the Communist party. It started with party members, then supporters, then in March they made it illegal to speak in opposition to the party at all. By the end of summer over 100,000 people were imprisoned. None of these people had anything to do with the fire and, in fact, more than half of them weren't even Communists. Just people who didn't fall in line.

This is how it starts. Declaring the loose concept of *being against Fascism* to be terrorism is like what Hitler, did but skips several of the steps. We all know how it ends. We aren't even starting in February. We are starting in ***March.***

This man can't be allowed to stay in office. If he does. If this movement loses momentum. The people of the United States aren't the only ones who lose. Everyone loses.  The *world* loses. 

I don't believe in definitives. As a student of history I find that speaking definitively is often the sign of someone who doesn't know what they are talking about. But there's no question here. This is the most dangerous action this man has taken and if he succeeds, Fascism wins. Every life lost fighting it has been for nothing. 

Don't let Fascism win. Don't let *him* win. 

Get out there. Get angry. Don't back down. 
For all our sakes. Please, don't back down.

Edit: Just to be clear, while I do think our best hope to slow the descent into Fascism would be to vote Biden in. No matter how much that man disgusts me. I also believe this election has already been stolen. 

Nixon resigned under protests, Mubarak was ousted in Egypt after the Arab Spring. 

There's more than one way to skin a cat. Vote, but be ready when the election is an inevitable sham. You have a right to protest. Use it."
2255,gufidi,Rule 10. Removed.
2256,gufidi,"Ethno-nationalism is fascism, but not all fascism is ethno-nationalism. There are other types."
2257,gufidi,"Feel free, no need to credit me though. Just, for the risk of being doxxed lol."
2258,gufidi,"Republicans have blocked every nomination to the elections commission, and have enacted every avenue they can for voter suppression. Trump has also been loudly and openly asking for foreign interference."
2259,gufidi,"I agree, but I just won't advocate for violence. Also if I did, the post would have gotten taken down."
2260,gufidi,"Oh I've been paying attention. This has been a slow poisoning of the American system since the 1950s. 

This is just one step, and for right now. The most attainable one."
2261,gufidi,Yes if you live in a swing state. Because it's less dangerous and there are really only two options here. This shit about I'd rather have trump for 4 more years than a modicum of competence because of some future outcome is why far left is hard to take seriously. Your comment is ridiculous. We have immense problems now and you are talking about a potential outcome 5 years away and that cuts against the likelihood of a sitting president not getting a second term. The only saving grace is that you actually talk about voting. Leftist nonvoters are a joke. I've been hearing about how the revolution will start for 15 years and it hasn't. Not even close. Things have just gotten worse.
2262,gufidi,"At this point even if Biden wins, Trump isn’t going to leave office willingly. More than likely the result will be called illegitimate as their was “huge mail in ballot fraud”. That’s even if you get to an election, there is either going to be a civil war or COVID is going to be a full blown pandemic at that point - both Trunps making."
2263,gufidi,"You said it yourself, voting Biden at least gives us more time. The left is not as organised as it needs to be, and if we give ourselves some time to get our shit together instead of sitting at home, breathing through our mouths and licking the USSR’s boots, we might actually get something worthwhile done"
2264,gufidi,"I mean. He was moved to a bunker yesterday amid the protests.

You can take it as I mean we should vote, and we should... But that's not what I was getting at."
2265,gufidi,"Those are sound reasons not to wholly trust the DCCC, and why Biden's choice for Vice President is almost more important to an election victory than a successful campaign.

It's not unlikely after all considering Joe Biden's age that whomever he chooses might need to assume the Presidency before the 2024 election.

That person needs to be qualified, capable, and up for the task."
2266,gufidi,"Fascism is a political ideology defined by social and political authoritarianism and ultra-nationalism. This is supported by ferocious anti-liberalism, anti-socialism and a violently exclusionist expansionist agenda. It also espouses a corporatist economic system.

The nationalist element is core to fascism as it sees the nation as the key societal element and the strenghth of that nation is paramount to the exclusion of virtually all else. To further this fascism always paints ""its group"" as the hard done by victim and ties up an individuals self esteem into the greater glory and achievments of the group. This links back into the corporatist economic ideas of fascism.

Fascism is not just ""being nasty to people you don't agree with"" or ""violence"" as the state has the authority of violence yet we do not call it fascist."
2267,gufidi,"Well, you're right about Centrists being shit, but about nothing else."
2268,gufidi,"Wake me up when a home gets burnt. And no, the housing development under construction doesn't count.

I can't speak for everyone, but I'm no ok with destroying small businesses. I do not believe in harming the working class.

Also, it's a bit disingenuous to pin all this destruction on anti-fascists. There are plenty of other groups and individuals there.

PS I would have allowed your comment to stand but you're cursing at people in it."
2269,gufidi,The election will be a sham because Republicans employ various tactics to keep minorities from voting or gerrymandering to take away voting power.
2270,gufidi,"The Republicans have blocked all nominations to the elections commission, have attempted everything in their power to enact voter suppression and Trump has been vocally asking for foreign interference. 

That's the stuff we see on the surface. 

If Trump wins despite everything you just said, I think you have your answer. I hope I'm wrong, but I'm often not when it comes to these things."

2290,gufidi,"> Also, this argument is extremely based, because from what I know people who associate themselves with antifa are usally anti-gun, and banning guns is one of the common decenst to facsism in the history of facsistic regiemes.

People who will call themselves antifa are usually leftists, who are not anti-gun. Liberals are anti-gun and they are not the left."

2293,gufidi,It's like it didn't read the post at all.
2294,gufidi,"^^^^

He obviously can't arrest people for being a ""member of antifa"" because that's not a thing

What he wants is the ability to slap the ""antifa""-label on every protestor that inconveniences him, and arrest them based on *that*"
2295,gufidi,"I’m in a strange position, I’ve always drifted right, usually in the middle of authright and libright, but I’ve always been at odds with Trump’s ideals. Do I generally take conservative views? Yes. However, I think trump is an embarrassment to the ideals that I’ve always held close. It’s disgusting. 

Now to actually address the topic, declaring antifa terrorists is declaring an idea terroristic, not an organization. This essentially means that expressing an idea is now a crime. In what way does this not blatantly disregard our constitutional right to free speech? If the supposed “antifa member” is not actively committing violence, then their rights can not and should not be infringed upon. 

Note: I am not an “antifa member”, one, because no organization exists to be a “member” of, and two, because I don’t wiah to align myself with something that gives the impression of inciting violence. I would consider myself anti-fascist though, which unfortunately, will be the same thing in the eyes of many."
2296,gufidi,name checks out
2297,gufidi,I’m a conservative and I don’t like this move
2298,gufidi,"I can be against Fascism and ""Antifa"" as a movement at the same time."
2299,gufidi,"This is a all people unite time. Not just the left. We the people, as citizens of the united states of america need to come together to stand against tyranny, just like we have done many times before. We will not be silenced. We will not go quietly into the night."
2300,gufidi,"This is tough. I would never push someone out of their comfort zone if they feel unsafe. 

Maybe make an anonymous twitter to spread information? Anti-fascist action and information is vital. Honestly I'm not sure what to tell you otherwise.

Just, never hide your anti-fascism and keep advocating for a better future. Even if it's just within your peer group."
2301,gufidi,"I feel you on this. Large crowds set off my anxiety like crazy. I don't like clubs, parties or concerts anymore now because of this. Felt so bad not attending a local rally last week. However, you could look up your area on the [BLM](https://blacklivesmatter.com/) website and see if they have ideas for assistance. There's also donating to [the NAACP](https://www.naacp.org/)."
2302,gufidi,You could sign petitions.
2303,gufidi,"There are things you can do which help fight fascism, being physically present with a crowd isn't at all necessary. A good bet is to find local groups which are anti-fascist and help them in what they're doing. The nature of the group can range greatly, as there are a lot of actions which are anti-fascist.

For more immediate help you could donate to bailout funds, or if you've got neighbors who are attending the rally maybe you could put some food together for the protesters?"

It threatens us all"
2309,gufidi,"If you fight fascism I would say you're as antifascist as any of us. 

Antifascism has no clear ideology, although it attracts more the people most opposed to fascism (often the ones that would be targeted by them first).

You are an antifascist, even if we would not get along very well normally due to some differences. Just being against authoritarianism is enough. 

If you ever need to attend protests I would recommend going with people more similar to your ideology though, because antifascist songs are somewhat limited and eventually they'll sing whatever their group is mostly formed of. 
Some libertarian market socialists or social democrats."
2310,gufidi,"Frankly I only phrased this the way I did because the people who usually frequent this sub. 

More accurately, anyone left of Fascist needs to be fighting. Anti-Authoritarian is Antifa."
2311,gufidi,Are you against facism (and willing to fight for it)? Then you're antifa. That's the exact issue with labelling antifa a terrorist organization
2312,gufidi,"If that's the case, you're just as anti fascist as the rest of us."
2313,gufidi,"You're one of us then.  I'm a business-running capitalist through and through.  I'm not far-left because of that.  I'm not on the right either because I watched them open the door to the globalist oligarchs and plutocrats since 1980 (along with the Dems who call themselves left here) and sold our industrial base to Shenzen for shareholder profit.  That said, I stand with the anarchists and everyone else who is now saying ""not on my watch."""
2314,gufidi,"That’s the point being made here, right now we need to set aside these differences. If you oppose fascism then we must fight side by side against it"

2319,gufidi,Biden is not anti-fascism.
2320,gufidi,"He has visited sites of protest, and released statements about policing reform, but it's in his electoral interest to play more into the Directly race related aspect of the protests because activating the black vote is frankly more likely and more beneficial than the youth vote."
2321,gufidi,"antifa  is a contraction that means ""anti-fascist"". If you're looking for people in uniforms with a single ideology you're going to be disappointed because antifa isn't an organization or a group, its a collection of individuals with one goal and no leadership. It is an ideology, not a company."
2322,gufidi,"Consent decrees alone are a good reason to choose Biden over Trump. Trump is threatening people protesting a horrific, heartless murder by police. Voting for harm reduction is the responsible choice."
2323,gufidi,">You honestly expect us to believe that you’re willing to ally with us evil capitalists

That's already happened. And it's ongoing. Capitalists are frequently anti-fascist - it's usually good for business 😂 

Ex: most people don't want to go to X business if it's known for hosting fascist events (this hypothetical happened in my neighborhood - the capitalists did the right thing and shut down the fascist events)

And capitalism can't be abolished in the same manner. You can't just talk to a business owner and they decide that there isn't capitalism allowed in their place of business anymore 🤷🏼‍♂️"

Anti-fascism has much more history than fighting Nazis.

In fact, anti-fascist movements emerged first in Italy, during the rise of Mussolini"

2327,gufidi,"Putting a date of birth to Al Qaueda as it existed in 2001 would be on the mid 90s. It existed before the war was declared, but it was always a very blurry group, not very organized.

Alquaeda was a blurry group of those following Bin Laden since 1988 or so, like most groups during the Afghanistan war agaisnt the soviet union.

The group grew in 1989, then became smaller as the war against soviets ended, then in 1991 Saudi Arabia told him they didn't want his jihadists, and called USA to attack Iraq.

From 1992 to 1996 the group lived on Sudan. On 1994 Saudi Arabia cut his ""family pay"" (7M$/year) due to his criticism of them being ""too soft"".

From 1994 onwards, another group in Afghanistan quickly grew and took over Afghanistan during their Civil War (1992-1996). The Taliban, you might know them. They worked together with alquaeda, housing them, funding them... 

On 1998, a group of big jihadist leaders from around the world called for murdering of US americans. 

On 2001, USA was attacked (note that plenty of countries were suffering from jihadist bombings and attacks since the end of the 80s). 

USA entered Afganistán, and Bin Laden escaped to Pakistan (the country that aided USA to support the Taliban to take power)"

So yeah I guess the standard was already pretty low, so we shouldn't really be surprised huh lmao"
2335,gufidi,"That's true I suppose, but I am seeing a lot of people coming out of the woodwork with some more helpful definitions of the movement on twitter at least. For example I was really surprised by exactly how many liberals didn't know 'antifa' stood for anti-fascist until this afternoon."
2336,gufidi,Such a shame that the media's portrayal becomes what we believe.
2337,gufidi,"The centrist dweebs with blue check marks don’t give a shit I agree.

2338,gufidi,"That’s a pretty stupid generalisation to make. A lot of liberals are antifascists and while they may not support violent actions, they still fundamentally support antifascism"
2339,gufidi,"I’m probably your typical 40 yo dem/liberal and I’ve never seen ANTIFA as anything more than a natural reaction to the shit that’s going on.  And I believe designating them as terrorists is absurd. How many churches have they shot up? How many mail bombs have they sent out? I may disagree with the communist or anarchist members, but the right consistently use all their base to mobilize against the left so why would I encourage infighting between *us*.  

And for the record, being a social democrat,  I have no problem paying more taxes if it meant a stronger social safety net including healthcare."
2340,gufidi,You thunk Biden would support antifa?

2342,gufidi,"> It gives the police the power to call anyone doing any kind of leftist action “antifa” and arrest them.

2371,gufidi,"There are no ""official communication accounts"" because ANTIFA, much to the President's chagrin, is not an organized group that has leaders, meetings, slogans, literature, or social media accounts."
2372,gufidi,"Well thats how government works. Terrorists hate how sociaty is constructed so they want to tear it down. 
And it's not my system, I don't like it either. But it is true that with help of ANTIFA nothing will get done and it will get even worse cause they give the government the incentive to press down with violence against their violence.

Now you can say that without agression nothing will be done and you might be right but I also don't want ANTIFA to have any sort of control over anything cause I dislke their ideology very much. 

Don't you see that law enforcment wants any excuse to annihilate every single protester?"
2373,gufidi,So your saying he is a fascist he doesn’t dislike Jews he just believes in nationalism and totalitarianism
2374,gufidi,[deleted]
2375,gufidi,"The 'terrorist' label will make it possible to disappear people under the patriot act, right?"
2376,gufidi,This isn’t about protestors. This is about removing political opposition.
2377,gufidi,That's the thing.
2378,gufidi,But it is the same thing... antifa is literally just short for anti-fascist you know right? And anti-fascism is a defensive action. Only idiots think antifa gives the impression of inciting violence when they’re simply defending others from fascist/white nationalist/and other bigoted people who have been committing the violence for over a century without being stood up to.
2379,gufidi,"Conservatism is fine. It plays a role in society. The Republican Party no longer really conservative. Instead, it represents corrupt authoritarianism and white nationalism. If you are a conservative please abandon the GOP. They are no longer the party of Lincoln.

Edit: fixed a typo"
2380,gufidi,"Guess what - within 6 months of the Reichstag fire in 1933, not only were most members of the communist party incarcerated, but also people who had attended public meetings and then they turned to people who had merely expressed sympathetic ideas."

2384,gufidi,"Same, and I have a lot of trauma that large crowds would trigger, which would render me useless, if not an outright hindrance. And I'm low income, I don't have a lot of resources. But I have my voice. I can reach out to the people around me and try to educate and empathize and get more people to see and understand. I can share other people's voices, ones that matter more right now or that say things better than I could. I can spread information and offer support."
2385,gufidi,"Aye, I could do that, comrade."
2386,gufidi,A fucking men. Times right now are deadly serious. Trump wants to curb our civil liberties and encourages violence against demonstrators. He is a fascist plain and simple. Right now if you consider yourself against Trump and against police violence then you are an ally of mine.

2388,gufidi,Sick I was hoping you’d say that.

2394,gufidi,Perhaps. However he surely won't try and designate them a terrorist organization and will at least put back some of the obama police and prison reform that Trump dismantled.

2401,gufidi,what world do you live in? liberals protect the status quo.
2402,gufidi,"Nah, it'll be a direct political dagger to the heart to say 'Antifa is alright'. He'll say the most general thing possible, such as clarifying how Antifa can't be labelled a domestic terror org from the Pres alone, say some good-feel thing about 'all opposition to Fascism is good and a part of our identity' or something like that, then go on to blast trump directly for overreach or hypocrisy.

Hell most like this will be a dead topic nationally by this midweek anyway."

2406,gufidi,"> The news are filled with articles about how terrorists are Antifa supporters, and how Trump is fucking awesome

And this is why it is so scary if Trump wins another election and these protests change not much. The world will be dragged into an age of fascism due to America's influence"
2407,gufidi,"Even if Bernie won he’d be helpless to dismantle the fascist regime. It would have been helpful to have some concessions given to the impoverished or for trans people like me to have decent access to healthcare.

""A tragic accident where, he left his gas on"" or they can hack your car if it has wifi and crash you into something like they did with Michael Hastings on Highland ave in LA a few years ago. Then there are the private companies who hire ex spies and intelligence people to join and infiltrate activist groups with the goal of rising to positions of influence to sabotage and steer the group toward a path of self destruction like Monsanto paid Xe to do. They have built a whole industry over the past decade or so to prepare for this."
2424,gufidi,Yep. What do you think the war on drugs was all about? Drugs? Fuck no. These fascists love their speed and coke. No it was about rounding up as many POC as possible and take away their right to vote.

2427,gufidi,"As long as the status quo benefits the corrupt and predatory, even ""true"" conservatism would be immoral, but at least it might come with silver linings like being conservationist.

2434,gufidi,"in addition to building societies we consider to be fair, I'd also hope for a method of governance that evolves alongside society. too many facets of American society have remained the same as they were when the county was founded, and have caused harm through their stagnation"
2435,gufidi,It’s not really a “movement” it’s any action taken to oppose fascism. Whether that’s saying “Nazis suck” online or defending a synagogue from being attacked by torch wielding fascists in the streets. We’re just people that don’t like fascists and want to stand up to them because it’s the right thing to do.
2436,gufidi,We just don’t want American people to be killed.
2437,gufidi,"Yes, indeed. Good question. While we're all not completely one thing or another, I do find a lot to align with in mutualism. Don't usually bother going there on reddit since it's usually an echo chamber of capitalism bad - socialism good or vice-versa, but it's a good distinction."
2438,gufidi,Bad bot
2439,gufidi,LOL wut?
2440,gufidi,"It does make a big difference. Obama used consent decrees to change problematic police stations like Ferguson and Chicago. Trump doesn’t think such a thing exists, basically. If you don’t think it makes a difference, then think of how many people all across the country think the police are acting just fine. Voting for harm reduction is a way to proactively help communities where they don’t get enough progressive or anti-fascist support."
2441,gufidi,"I will say I do see the pragmatic reasons for him being in office. He might be an abysmal president, who doesn’t do anything to make the US or world a better place; but at least he (hopefully) wouldn’t be actively instigating racial violence, stripping rights away from minorities, women and anyone within the LGBT community, or actively steering the world towards catastrophe."
2442,gufidi,"There would be hardly any difference, some things would improve, others would worsen. But at the end of the day the Obama/Biden years is what gave us Trump, and Vote Blue No Matter Who types are blind to that because trump is more rude than Biden. 

Hell, Biden’s own campaign has open scorn for socialists. Crying about not being socialist is at the core of the modern Democratic Party, I’d be surprised if any major player condemned this."
2443,gufidi,I agree wholeheartedly!
2444,gufidi,That allowed for non-is citizens to be detained without trial.   The ndaa 2012 allowed for us citizens suspected of terrorism to be held.
2445,gufidi,"Not us citizens.  Obama made it for anyone, citizen or not, suspected of terrorism.  Look up ndaa-2012.  He signed it december 31, 2011, at 11:26pm."
2446,gufidi,"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/01/antifa-charlottesville-violence-fbi-242235

>Federal authorities have been warning state and local officials since early 2016 that leftist extremists known as “antifa” had become increasingly confrontational and dangerous, so much so that the Department of Homeland Security formally classified their activities as “domestic terrorist violence,” according to interviews and confidential law enforcement documents obtained by POLITICO.


Antifa was labeled as domestic terrorism under the Obama regime.

There is no guarantee that Biden regime would be any different"
2447,gufidi,"because the issue is cultural. It's not the constitution. It's not the laws. It's not even politicians, they just ride on this if they're Republican.

It's the fact the South never fully lost and America can't stop thinking of the ideals of Manifest Destiny, when that has been long dead. The American Dream only worked because free or cheap land was regularly given, but in the end America ended up proving itself to be a parasitic virus that needs constantly more land or it falls apart because they don't believe the government can help others. Muh 'murican dream. Edit: And to elaborate on the South never losing, you got sentiment from rural and southern areas to want another civil war, with songs about the south rising again and so on, thanks to their loss not eradicating them, whereas in Germany, Nazis were eradicated."
2448,gufidi,I was agreeing with you don’t worry man
2449,gufidi,"Exactly, it’s undercover"
2450,gufidi,"Thank you but I'm aware of the definition.  Note the quotes, I was demonstrating a conversation playing dumb about Anti-fa to distance myself from it.  I'm suggesting that it is harder to vilify someone that identifies as being against fascism than someone that is ""anti-fa."""
2451,gufidi,lol oh sentient bot... tell me what was racist?
2452,gufidi,"Well, I agree then. Most people don't live in swing states anyways."
2453,gufidi,I didn't know what you meant by that though.
2454,gufidi,"There’s certainly a precedent for a chief executive pushing the boundaries of power, with Lincoln being the most glaring example (habeas corpus, jailing thousands of newspaper editors and owners, military draft, etcetera).  It’s up to us to ensure that the three branches of government remain independent of one another and jealous of their respective powers.

Good discussion."
2455,gufidi,"Not even that. It's a self-identitier for people who aren't pro-fascism. 

Anonymous actually does things under that name and acts as though it's an Organization. Antifa is literally just everyone who thinks Fascism is a bad idea."
2456,gufidi,I'm worried about the younger generation. They don't seem to understand or take seriously the threat that is being made. I've found countless young people flaunting their ideals all over social media and have been posting recklessly during the protests. I won't go into further detail.  I knew what to look for so I could see them and if I could see them the state can see them.
2457,gufidi,The ordinary spending approval for your defence automatically gives the president dictator-like powers? I wish you were joking. I guess it does not matter under what ridiculous law people will be put in camps. Because soon they will be. I truly feel for you.
2458,gufidi,"There is an article on the front page of Fox news right now, desperately trying to link Antifa to violence.  Their source: the sick fuck [Andy Ngo](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/andy-ngo-right-wing-troll-antifa-877914/)."
2459,gufidi,"So the media made it up and you didnt victimize Andy Ngo, a gay Asian reporter? Stfu clown you have yourselves to blame for being violent so many times"
2460,gufidi,"Generally, and this is not just political but cultural as well, liberals want to bring about change and conservatives want to maintain the status quo. Without conservatives to pump the breaks, change might come too quickly or could be rash or ill advised. And without liberals trying to make things better, the status quo would be stagnate and there would be no progress in society. So you need both to balance each other out and allow society make good and necessary changes in a responsible way. 

As far as politics go, big cities tend to have Democratic controlled governments because Republicans have generally abandoned them.  In very broad terms, Democrats want to help the poor and middle class, while Republicans only look out for the rich. This is nothing new. 

Liberals think that we all should work together via the state to help each other. They value altruism and cooperation. Conservatives think that it should be every man for himself. They value individualism and greed. (Yes, greed. Look at the stock brokers and corporate CEOs that fund the GOP. They are clearly driven by greed.)

Churches and community are there to pick up the slack when government doesn’t do enough to help the poor, usually due to bad legislation or obstruction from conservative law makers. 

I assure you that liberals do genuinely care and absolutely do help the homeless. It sounds like your conception of liberals is a fallacious straw man argument a la Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity. 

It may be hard to wrap your head around this, but people on the left really do just want to help each other and make the world a better place."
2461,gufidi,[deleted]
2462,gufidi,"Luckily, I'm able to vote! Sadly though, the state I live in is HEAVILY biased towards republican. I plan on registering as Republican so I can participate in primary elections"
2463,gufidi,"Yeah people assume there’s some sort of organizing behind it all but literally anyone can be an antifascist, you don’t need to follow certain steps or ideologies or get a membership. It just is."
2464,gufidi,"The fact that this sentiment is considered ""revolutionary"" or somehow ""political"" is staggering and terrifying."
2465,gufidi,">at least he (hopefully) wouldn’t be actively instigating racial violence, stripping rights away from minorities, women and anyone within the LGBT community, or actively steering the world towards catastrophe.

what an *incredibly* low bar to surpass holy shit"
2466,gufidi,"Political, racial, gender, and sexual minorities will never be safe here until the American state ceases to exist. The cultural norms are burned into people from the day they’re born and it’s terrifying."

Just remember to keep context. Just like the bulk of peaceful protesters are being labeled rioters because of the destructive behavior of a few, the huge majority of cops truly are good people who sacrifice a hell of a lot to serve the public. But the very small percentage of cops that are evil fucks, are absolutely ruining so much for so many, and we owe it to everyone to bring the heat on them and have each and every one that abuses the power we trust them with, put in prison where they belong.

2468,gufidi,He's probably talking about Tankies
2469,gufidi,"I’m talking about people who endlessly defend the USSR and say anything bad they did is CIA propaganda. Like the other guy said, tankies"
2470,gufidi,"I don’t think you have to worry just yet. America won’t descend into that madness any time soon. Trump’s supporters are rabid, but there’s a lot of cases of them just being older and having “liberal” kids or grandkids.

But once Trump starts locking up young teenagers and twenty-something’s for what they said online, his base will turn very quickly. We don’t have to worry yet, but if he “wins” in November and can play it slow for a couple more years? Yeah, we might be in trouble."
2471,gufidi,"I left in 2003 because I personally knew over a dozen Americans who were disappeared between 2001 and 2003 (and haven't yet been seen by anyone I've been able to find — family, friends, colleagues). I also don't fit into the GWB-Trumpian ideal of what a white man is supposed to think and feel and do, or even believe in. By 2009, I'd come to accept that I was unlikely to ever be able to return (and, for example, help take care of my 80-something-year-old dad). The opposition I see to Trump and his systematic destruction and *looting* of the country is the closest thing to hope that I've had in over a decade.

Please, `$DEITY`, let the good folks win this time. I'd like to be able to admit in polite society that yes, I'm from the US, without either feeling slimy or having people pity and/or laugh at me. (With excellent reason at present.)

2472,gufidi,"Since 9-11, yeah."
2473,gufidi,Fox has been doing this for a long time and has really increased these types of stories since Trump became president. The morning after the first looting they were blaming Antifa. They have been waiting for something like this so Trump could make that declaration. They've been calling for it for some time because it deflects from the growth of the far-right in the country.

So yeah I would say the state and local government was involved."

Wilson did more than most presidents for racism and the Red Scare. He was one of the most influencial Lost Causers, he segregated federal agencies and his reaction to the remergence of the KKK and lynching was wanking to ""Birth of a Nation"" in the White House. Then he started one of the most comprehensive and invasive domestic espionage campaign to this date, setting course for the Red Scare and further down the line the Patriot Act.

Harding being mostly corrupt as fuck and otherwise buisy writing letters about his dick to his sweetheart 
 was actually an improvement. In the ""at least He doesn't carry water for the KKK."" sense of improvement."

2665,h89uhn,"I had this exact conversation with my father. I called them concentration camps (because that's what they were), and he got mad and said they were internment camps. He said because the Japanese Americans were not being murdered they were not concentration camps. SMH."
2666,h89uhn,"I’m not making an excuse for the event, but the difference in language between the two has to do with purpose.  Internment camps were, basically, just big prisons, whereas concentration caps had the intention of killing people.  I’m not saying either are good, I’m just saying that the reason there’s a distinction does not simply come down to “the US doesn’t want to acknowledge its own evil so they have to water it down to the point where it becomes palatable”"
2667,h89uhn,"As disposable as the Japanese internment camps were, equating them to the German concentration camps is the kind of whataboutism that the neo Nazis like, because you are equating imprisonment with camps designed to work you to death or just skip the ""work"" part."

Also included in that letter:

- Japanese culture made Japanese-Americans likely to betray the US

- People were emotional and might have harmed them, so the camps were for their own protection

- The US didn’t have the resources to investigate every espionage claim, so it’s better to just stick ‘em in a camp

- German-Americans were sometimes sent to camps too

- “The interned Japanese were housed, fed, protected and cared for. Many who now complain would not even be alive if the internment had not been done.”

There was also a second letter that basically just said “The Japanese did worse stuff to Filipinos, so Japanese-Americans should be grateful that they were treated so well.”"

2683,h89uhn,"After Pearl harbor, the US started rounding up japanese people living on and near the west coast and putting them into camps under the guise that if any of them were sympathizers, they wouldn't be able to help the japanese government execute an attack on the west coast."
2684,h89uhn,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans

Extremely abridged version: during WWII Roosevelt ordered the forced relocation of Japanese people, citizens and recent immigrants, into camps. This included about 120,000 people and famous americans such as George Takei were interned. Many were forced to forfeit their property and had their livelihoods ruined, much like the disenfranchisement of the Jews in Germany. They remained interned until march 1946."
2685,h89uhn,"not every concentration camp is a death camp

they were, by definition, concentration camps. However, we have since used some rhetorical trickery to separate concentration and internment camps. They are one and the same. A subtype of these camps are death camps."
2686,h89uhn,"I see your point, but I’ve always come across “revisionist history” as a term in the context of shit like this, or Holocaust deniers, etc.

2690,h89uhn,Should have given in and then started calling the Nazis' camps 'internment camps'.
2691,h89uhn,Exactly they are for concentrating (you know like orange juice) people into. Taht is the descriptive term anything else is just whitewashing.

2693,h89uhn,[removed]
2694,h89uhn,"Because they were, that term then did not have the connotation it has now, and *internment camp* is just a synonym used as a post hoc euphemism.   
  
The Nazis had scores of concentration camps that were literally just for detaining people en masse and so did all other belligerents in that war. Because the Nazis used some of those concentration camps as extermination camps, the former term took on the latter connotation."
2695,h89uhn,"It's interesting as a European reading this because the concentration camp/death camp thing is pretty well known here. I guess it's because we had concentration camps in a lot of places (like here in the Netherlands) whose main purpose wasn't the mass killing. Like people got killed there, but mostly as a (*very* much intended) side effect. Even Auschwitz will often, especially if it's on the news or anything semi official,  rightly be referred to as Auschwitz Birkenau if referring to the death camp bit."

The literal definition disagrees with you.  A concentration camp is a place where you concentrate people, what happens after that decides if it is then a death camp or a labor camp.

Fascism demands nationalism, but also a strong social hierarchy (not inherently, but practically always racist), militarism, totalitarianism, and is extremely traditionalist. 

Left-wing authoritarianism cannot be fascist because the left is by definition progressive (as opposed to traditionalist) and is antihierarchical. It comes with its own flaws, but it is entirely separate from fascism."

1) People are accepting Greta’s conclusions about global warming.
2) Greta is 16.
Conclusion: 16 year olds are capable of making conclusions that people accept.

1) Jeffrey Epstein paid 16 year old girls for sex (He implies that Epstein didn’t rape them, but rather engaged them in consensual prostitution. I don’t think the facts are on his side, but it’s not essential to the argument so I’m pushing that issue aside).
2) People are not accepting of 16 year olds prostituting themselves.
Conclusion: 16 year olds are not capable of making decisions that people accept.

I mean, even when you break it down to its most innocuous, it’s pretty dumb. Prostitution is looked down on regardless of age. People aren’t accepting Greta’s position so much as acknowledging her acceptance of others’ (namely scientists’) position.

Of course, that sheerness is only made a precious element by their own ego which is surely driven by their surroundings. 

Hopefully, it is to help them take precautions when making decisions. But all decisions? Even their own?

I, as a citizen of peace and mind, fear of a confused and disavowed country, only if those same people who are not only anticipating a revolution but hiding from it as well, all in their own little ways, some good some bad; there is the same principal in common; God; but that is very hard for the commons to understand. It comes only when they're done listening to you. 

Some good, some bad, all interpretations rely on transfer of information within a realm of understanding which doesn't include the human race in general. Weird huh? 

In general, the entirety of the human race is indeed a race.

But it's a marathon. To them it's not -- but you see, that's probably because their interpretation of that statement is directed towards people who only *need* to run a marathon. Y'know, cause of certain people they can't help but see on the side of the road struggling to walk? Hey, maybe they got injured in a car accident huh.

""Hmm, okay then."", they go. Because the only thing a trained mind can do is interpret it as if it were an assumption. So they assume they couldn't get a lawyer for that broken 'whatever', and so then they're fat not only because of the food they ate before the injury, but also because of their inability to fix the injury due to depression. 

Hopeful in prayers, all the wishes, and a grand karma would surely get the right person to think a thought in solitude awareness of pattern, so that they'd sync up their soul to the unknown which ultimately, however it goes, boom-boom-bang-bang hand motions and a joking attitude whenever it comes up because, ooh, if anybody, like, for sure knew that they did voodoo?

Who's the luckiest man alive at that point? Probably the president. Only he knows all these different sorts of cultures and societies within our country. All those cameras and microphones. Wait, so what's the unknown then? Ooh, me thinks there is still an unknown entity at that point 'cause people gots to go to bed at night and there's only so many cameras and microphones that can be turned off, until sometimes they're not, and coincidentally anyway, the worst people get out of the fray and into their own realm of purpose. Schizophrenia probably sets in, this if course confuses the A.I., which definitely picks it all up, I'd imagine the information is then reeled in for review and discarded or archived. Sometimes it's not, or it's looked back upon. Interesting stuff there, huh? 

Wouldn't you imagine, with all the technology to have eyes and ears on everything and everyone, that you'd just love to let everyone know about it. So, all at once, or?

Good question. Are you assuming a fact within history, then, that the pyramids had one man in the center looking upwards at a giant reflector showing its surroundings within a 50 mile radius, or that those things were built by slaves?

2950,hahk0w,"> OAKLAND —  When sheriff’s deputies searched a white van on June 6 in a wooded hamlet in Santa Cruz County, they found ammunition, firearms, bomb-making equipment — and a ballistic vest with a curious patch.
The patch contained an igloo and Hawaiian-style print, markings associated with a growing, extremist, anti-government movement aimed at fomenting unrest and civil war.

>On Tuesday, federal law enforcement officials announced that they were charging Air Force Sgt. Steven Carrillo, 32, the alleged owner of that vest, and suspected accomplice Robert A. Justus Jr., 30, of Millbrae in the May 29 shooting death of a federal security officer in Oakland.

>Officials said Carrillo, who also faces state charges in the June 6 killing of a Santa Cruz sheriff’s deputy, was a follower of the “boogaloo” movement, which a federal complaint said is not a fixed group but includes people who identify themselves as militia and target perceived government tyranny.

>Justus’ social media posts also show support for boogaloo memes. One post reviewed by the Times names people who have been killed by law enforcement, including Oscar Grant, shot by transit police at Oakland’s Fruitvale station in 2009, and Vicki Weaver, wife of white supremacist Randy Weaver, killed by an FBI sniper during the 1992 Ruby Ridge siege in Idaho.

>The federal government charged Carrillo with killing federal security officer David Patrick Underwood, 53, a resident of the small East Bay city of Pinole, and the attempted murder of Underwood’s partner. The charges qualify for the death penalty, but officials said no decision has yet been made on whether to seek it. Justus is charged with aiding Carrillo in the killing and attempted killing.

>The security officers were shot while guarding a federal building in downtown Oakland during a protest over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The pair used the protest as a cover for their plans to attack law enforcement, said FBI Special Agent In Charge Jack Bennett.

>”There is no evidence that these men had any intention to join the demonstration in Oakland,” Bennett said at a Tuesday news conference. “They came to Oakland to kill cops.”

>Federal officials said Carrillo fired the shots and Justus drove him around in a white van. Surveilance video showed that Carrillo slid open the van’s side door to fire his weapon, officials said, and Justus acted at the getaway driver.

>The two men were linked through cellphone records, officials said. Carrillo used a privately made, unmarked machine gun — a so-called ghost gun — with a silencer to kill Underwood, Bennett said. The federal complaint against Carrillo said law enforcement found similarities in fired cartridge cases at the shootings in both Oakland and Santa Cruz.

>The Oakland killing sparked an eight-day manhunt that led to Carrillo’s arrest after someone reported a white van containing firearms and bomb-making equipment in the small, mountainous Santa Cruz County community of Ben Lomond.

>Evidence in the van led authorities to Carrillo’s Ben Lomond home. There, in the early afternoon, Carrillo allegedly opened fire on the deputies, killing Sgt. Damon Gutzwiller and injuring another deputy. An explosion rocked the property, the Sheriff’s Office said.

>Carrillo was shot during the gunfire, ran away and then hijacked a car on a nearby highway, according to the federal complaint against him. When he was arrested, he was bleeding from his hip.

>Carrillo apparently used his own blood to write messages on the hood of the hijacked car, the complaint said. It identified the writing as “BOOG,” “I Became Unreasonable,” and “Stop the Duopoly.”

>He was part of an elite Air Force security unit at Travis Air Force Base in the city of Fairfield. He served as a team leader trained to protect aircraft at air strips from insurgents and terrorists.

>Brian Levin, executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino, said Carrillo’s posts on social media, including Facebook, became increasingly disturbing in the days before the Oakland shooting.

>Levin said the center’s research shows there have been 27 homicides connected to far-right extremists in the U.S. since 2019. That number doesn’t include the most recent Bay Area killings. The FBI arrested three devotees of the boogaloo movement in Nevada recently, and they were charged with inciting violence with the use of Molotov cocktails at protests.

>Levin said boogaloo followers include ultra-libertarians and white supremacists, but they all share a belief in a coming second civil war.

>”They are 2nd Amendment insurrectionists,” Levin said. “The boogaloo boys believe in armed insurrection and include attacks on the police.”

>Other experts on extremists said the boogaloo movement was still evolving, and its philosophy varied depending on geography and the underlying beliefs of individual members.

>While followers all want a second civil war to reset American society, their desired new society varies from embracing racism to one focused on armed libertarianism, the experts said.

>Many followers discovered the movement on internet chat sites. It then migrated to more mainstream social media, including Facebook and TikTok, where young adherents post videos of themselves dancing in their trademark Hawaiian shirts.

>Devin Burghart, executive director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, which tracks far-right extremist activity, said alt-right groups, including the boogaloo movement, increased their online presence dramatically when governments ordered shutdowns to protect people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

>Adherents attended reopen protests and later shifted to the Floyd demonstrations, he said.

Following President Trump’s call for “MAGA night” on Twitter after protesters demonstrated in front of the White House, Burghart said, he saw an uptick in alt-right participation in Floyd rallies.

>”We only saw a handful of instances” before that, Burghart said. “We saw more boogaloo boys showing up at rallies with their Hawaiian shirts.”

>Members of the New Mexico Civil Guard militia group, one of whom shot a protester recently over the removal of a statue, also have ties to the boogaloo movement, he said.

>”A number of boogaloo boys started in different elements of the far right and have been drawn to the more confrontational stance of the boogaloo over time,” Burghart said.

>Justus was under surveillance when he and his parents entered the federal building in San Francisco on June 11, nearly a week after Carrillo’s arrest, and asked to speak to an FBI agent. His mother said they wanted to tell the FBI about the white van used in the Oakland killing.


>Justus told an agent he met Carrillo on Facebook, and they agreed that Carrillo would pick him up at a transit station in Oakland for the May 29 Floyd protest; At the station, Carrillo turned over the wheel to Justus.

>According to the criminal complaint against him. Justus said he did not want to participate in the killing but he was trapped in the van with Carrillo.

>After shooting the officers, Justus said, Carrillo was thrilled. “Did you see how they ... fell!” Justus said Carrillo exclaimed.

>An FBI agent who wrote the criminal complaint called Justus’ statement “a false, exculpatory narrative carefully crafted to fit what Justus believed to be the state of evidence.”"

Remember, they want the boog. Chaos feeds that


The problem is the left- right binary is not at all sophisticated enough to handle how nuanced and varied political ideologies are and therefore is largely (though not entirely) useless.

Edit: yes, anarchists can care about police brutality and/or BLM at large. But they dont all. In my city a guy burned a cop car and he was very clearly not there to support the protest.

Some anarchists care about these things, others are just using the opportunity like the boogs."

It's fucked up how Republicans do their voters. They profit from corporate-friendly decisions that cheat their constituents out of high quality education, high quality health and social services, meaningful work, and a living wage, then straight up bold-face lie to them, encoraging them to believe they're out of these things because of some scapegoat group (insert immigrants, blacks, women etc. here). They prey on humans' biases and other unreasonable instincts, stoking that fear and hatred, and then all that gets released on the rest of us! 

To be fair, I believe that Democrats pull this shit too. It's just that Republicans seem especially brazen, unapologetic, and shameless about it. And they don't seem to have many redeeming members in their ranks. Romney's conscience seems to be nagging him lately, so maybe there's something there. I'm waiting for him to show some moral courage and sever ties with the party, but I won't hold my breath. Where's their AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren? Where are their people with actual ideas about how to HELP Americans, not hurt them? Where are their ideas about how citizens can have MORE freedoms, not less?

I do feel for the few Dems on the left trying to get good done. First they need to overcome the smiling obstacles of Dem leadership like Pelosi and Schumer who constantly undermine and undercut them as being unrealistic and idealistic, selling the lie that they need scale things back to get the votes needed for anything, preening like they’d be on the side of the left if only they could be. Then, even if they do somehow manage to overcome the corporate catch and kill operators they still need to get past the overt corporate servants in the GOP. I can’t even imagine how abso-fucking-lately exhausting it must be to be an actual progressive in Congress, especially when you’re always trying to play a balancing act of where you can give ground on even if you don’t want to but need to in order to gain ground in other spots.

3013,hahk0w,Seems we need more recent data
3014,hahk0w,"The data there is outdated and refers only to a relative comparison of black to white (rather than white to POC more broadly, where the gap is notable narrower).

Regardless the point still stands.  Yes, white Americans are less likely to be killed on average.  

A standard comparison for measuring bias is what’s called a “fair share” index - that compares a groups share of a subset of the population (e.g., police killings) to their share of the broader population (e.g., US total); they under-index at ~75, which means they are killed ~25% less likely than you would expect all else equaled.  That’s a much more appropriate reference point for the context of this discussion.

However, they still represent the majority of police killings.

And they still are killed at a much higher rate relative to incarceration (the best proxy variable available for police encounters).

Black Americans, for example, are ~5.1x as likely to be incarcerated.  

Even if I take at face value the ~2.8x figure you cited for fatal encounters, it’s apparent that white americans are more likely to be killed on a per-encounter basis

So nothing I said above was false, though you could easily find fault with my use of “marginal.”

The reality is that: IF a white American person is in a police confrontation, they are arguably MORE likely to end up dead.  They’re just notably less likely to have that confrontation in the first place.

That’s not dismissing the larger issue here, but the characterization and root cause of the issue is important.  And the post I replied to completely misrepresented the nature of it."

> Not only is the trade economy structured to make lifegiving and caregiving very costly choices, mothers are depicted as parasites on society and a despised class. The term *single mom* today is as derogatory as *unwed mother* was in the past, the morality offended being not in the lack of marriage but in the possible dependency on social support. In the west, women supposedly have lifestyle choices but only if they make the choice to have extremely few or no children and a career or a wealthy partner. A single mother on welfare is treated as the most contemptible creature within the law. Parasites are hated as they weaken the host. The trade economy does not recognize that all men and women parasited off of their mothers in a very physical reality in order to exist. Underlying every patriarchal society and the trade economy is the idea that lifegivers should be grateful to the society for letting them and their offspring live. This is a complete reversal of biological fact. 

  
and  


> *The root of society, the first dependence, is created when a woman gives birth to a child. The nature of society depends on how it is built out from that core, whether all share in responsibility for the first and all other dependencies or whether the strongest are pulled away to isolate caregivers and commodify dependency.*

3109,etajxq,Having mothers that care about us and support us in what we do? What more can someone ask for?

3111,etajxq,Is the right so collectively maladjusted that the idea of having parents that love and support their children is utterly alien to them?
3112,etajxq,Don’t they realize how cool this actually looks?
3113,etajxq,Masculinity so fragile you can't love your own mother
3114,etajxq,This but unironically
3115,etajxq," ah yes, because conservatives clearly don’t have parents"
3116,etajxq,I swear the right are so dumb that they don’t realize what banksy stands for.
3117,etajxq,"Intergenerational solidarity at its finest ... c. London, 1979, maybe."
3118,etajxq,Only r/conservative would make fun of fighting for your rights and supportive mothers

3120,etajxq,Everyone can do their part to fight for a better world. Thanks Mom!
3121,etajxq,Toxic masculinity is that you?
3122,etajxq,I sent this to my mom back when I first started to go on demonstrations. She will always make sure I'm warm <3
3123,etajxq,I wish my mother would be that supportive lol
3124,etajxq,Wow that thread is sad

3138,etajxq,The core of true Anarchism is mutual aid - people helping people. Nothing in this picture goes against that. Maybe the son even shoplifted some nice muffins for his mom after the protest.
3139,etajxq,"Things my own mother has bought me to support my protest efforts: a nice high-visibility jacket, protein bars, a very nice and durable metal water bottle, a raincoat, new hat and gloves, and poster-making supplies (which she still buys now and then when she sees it on sale).

3156,etajxq,We only like “traditional families”
3157,etajxq,Isn't that a good thing?

3167,etajxq,This is a granny not a mom.  A mom should be wearing Capri pants with fancy ass pockets and a jogging hoodie.
3168,etajxq,The comments in that thread are confusing. If they're serious then I guess r/conservative actually has some decent people. If they're supposed to be satire then they're really sending mixed messages on what should be considered bad. Nothing new in that case I suppose.
3169,etajxq,Conservatives think they're *so* funny
3170,etajxq,"This is the album artwork for an MGK record from 2013. If y’all haven’t heard of him, he raps a lot about anti-establishment, pseudo-anarchy, pro working class lyrics. I’ve met a few people that kinda personify the kid in this meme and they are all good people with pure intentions. The outfits have evolved as that’s more of a late 90’s uniform but the goals and ideology are the same."
3171,etajxq,Fuck yeah! Fuck Capitalism
3172,etajxq,"yes, it literally takes a whole village. Also mutual aid means doing ""uncool"" domestic labor like caretaking and food preparation for our neighbors and comrades"

3177,etajxq,This is so cringey
3178,etajxq,Antifa is still a thing? I thought y'all all got tired of being the laughing stock of YouTube... well besides sovereign citizens and flat earthers

https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/et9c2p/off_to_fight_capitalism/fff8c7p?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 
These people have some serious mommy issues to solve."
3201,etajxq,"I think they're implying that we're childish. Still being taken care of by mom or some shit. It goes back to their incredibly fragile concept of ""manhood,"" where if you aren't what they consider a ""real man"" then you're inferior and therefore invalid."
3202,etajxq,So I commented on the original thread and was permanently banned from r/Conservatives LOL!
3203,etajxq,The last time I went out to protest the Proud Boys here in Portland my mom helped me pack up a backpack full of medical supplies and bandanas. She’s almost 70. I love my mom.
3204,etajxq,Exactly.  My mom buys me supplies like protein bars and warm clothing.  She has asked if I had a good breakfast on days she knew I'd be protesting.  How great is that?  Knowing I have someone who supports my right to protest even if she and I don't always agree on the topic of such protests (she has come around quite a bit in the last few years which is awesome).
3205,etajxq,It's been a while since I've been at a genuine loss for words from sheer confusion...but alas.
3206,etajxq,"Pretty sure the artwork is from Banksy, who leans left, so the original image probably was not even meant to be derogatory towards anarchists"
3207,etajxq,"Yeah, we’ve always liked this image since the first time it was posted. Right wingers haven’t caught up with us yet"
3208,etajxq,You would think that of all the groups they’d be the ones to celebrate a nice positive family interaction between a mother and her child.  So much for the tolerant right🙄🙄🙄
3209,etajxq,I'm still not sure what they have against hating fascists tbh
3210,etajxq,They don’t like women.
3211,etajxq,They hate traditional family values
3212,etajxq,"Anarchist mum is the best mum, she looks after all antifa supersoldiers as if they're her own."
3213,etajxq,"Also, the image says ""capitalism"". By bringing up Anti-fascist action out of the blue, you'd think they're unconsciously connecting fascism with capitalism.

Funny how that works out 🤔"
3214,etajxq,"As someone from r/all I think the reason they call you scumbags is an ingrained association of violent protests with antifa. 

Ive never really questioned it before, since I’ve never had that idea challenged. looking at this subreddit you guys aren’t anywhere near as violent or toxic as I thought you were. My politics and yours are probably really similar I just always thought antifa was a more violent extreme, because that’s the only time people mention antifa: when someone is being violent. 

Jesus Christ I fell for propaganda."
3215,etajxq,Yeah you're supposed to hate women because you're mom doesn't love you and you need to get a real job like Derek. He's already got his own house. Why can't you be more like Derek?
3216,etajxq,"cuck? Did you pick that up while beating off on PornHub? [Well, we see what genre you look for.](https://www.gq.com/story/why-angry-white-men-love-calling-people-cucks)

3218,etajxq,The reddit conservative version is stabbing your dad then posting angrily on 4chan
3219,etajxq,alt right version is using tired Pepe memes with clown wigs.  They had to steal someone elses frog character yet somehow they they are the ones creative with memes....right....all the chans were never good.
3220,etajxq,That's because populism has been appropriated by every political leaning except for far leftism because that's where they all stole it from.

The settlers had chosen Thomas Studley to run the warehouse.  He proved able to talk his way out of blame, but not prevent the outflow.  And, he could do nothing about the settlers who stopped working once they learned that they didn’t have to.  Then, the starving began.

3229,etajxq,"Yeah, it's been a thing since the 1930's.  We're not going anywhere."
3230,etajxq,This may be hard to believe but we don't base our political views on how much it makes people on YouTube laugh at us.
3231,etajxq,Yeah like my mother might not agree with me politically but she is still proud of me for actually trying to fight for a better world. She does always tell me to watch out for myself when I go out to protest though. But that's sweet. And I think that's how it always should be.
3232,etajxq,"I went to an XR intro thing and my mum wished me a good time, and supports me. But then again she does think the world needs more socialist ideas and practices so maybe it's not too surprising she supports me like that."
3233,etajxq,That's cause it is; a bunch of us use this image unironically
3234,etajxq,"It's because they're so concerned about giving off this facade of toughness that they look down on people that aren't trying to bullshit.

3235,etajxq,Living with that much emotional repression sounds so exhausting. I love my comrades and I love my mommy and I don’t care who knows it!
3236,etajxq,"I think their hate of women comes often from a bad relationship with their mothers. At least some of them. They also make a weird amount of memes about their fathers, not sure if I noticed that correctly."
3237,etajxq,The ones who think this infantalizes the left probably still live with their moms but as a burden rather than in a supportive and respectful way.
3238,etajxq,"No, they think talking back to your mom like in the picture is weakness."

3254,etajxq,Same. I thought Antifa was some literal terrorist leftist organization that went around stabbing and killing people who didn’t agree with them like media made them seem out to be. Oh how foolish and easily manipulated I turned out to be. Didn’t even occur to me that Antifa just meant anti-fascist. So now according to conservatives I’m terrorist scum because I’m definitely all for Nazi’s getting decked and wiped out.
3255,etajxq,But then you came and looked and made up your own mind. We need more of that. Badly.
3256,etajxq,Don't beat yourself up too much.  I used to think that antifa and neo-Nazis were the two sides of the same coin.  Oh how foolish I was.
3257,etajxq,"Well yeah nobody mentions when Antifa goes to a protest and stands in solidarity for the rights of the people, they can't spin that against Antifa. Now when a protest does turn out to be violent (remember it's often a counter-protest against Nazis) they blow it up as if it's this huge thing and they're all just thugs.

I'm happy there are people out there willing to stand and fight for us, even when it's physical."
3258,etajxq,"> ingrained association of violent protests with antifa.

Yeah, I mean I get that and won't argue it...

But who the hell doesn't associate violence and mayhem with punk rock?"
3259,etajxq,Right wingers are the dumbest creatures in the shape of men
3260,etajxq,No I mean they all recognize that poverty is cyclical and that health insurance is unattainable for most
3261,etajxq,"It was.

3262,etajxq,">Then, each was free to take from the warehouse whatever he needed to  live.  In went fruit, game, lumber, pelts, axes, saws, hammers, cloth,  and out went…everything.

This is literally how indigenous Americans distributed resources for centuries.  It works just fine.  The European settlers must've fucked up somewhere."
3263,etajxq,"Yeah this is so fucking funny, as if people from a settlement would just stop working and die if they aren't forced to. This is of course a gross lie about history, in reality settlers were the ones relying on the Powhatans. The fact that he thought someone would believe his story about people stopping to working and starving themselves is somewhat worrying."

3272,etajxq,"Don't you know, conservatives are all self-made, they gave birth to themselves!"
3273,etajxq,Somehow they just can't understand toxic masculinity while also being so emotionally stunted that they think it's a bad thing to have a healthy relationship with your mom.
3274,etajxq,I randomly got reddit coins to give awards and I was waiting for the right comment.  I respect anyone who says they love their mommy.  (Plus I still call my mom that even at 27 years old lol)
3275,etajxq,"Its not hate of women, its hate of femininity. 

You know, sexual frustration and fear of sexal humiliation. Same reason aa they massively use the term “cuck” as highly offensive , because they see it as the ultimate degradation.

So, basically people who use snowflake as an insult are quoting a domestic terrorist who blows up skyscrapers because he's insecure about how good he is in bed.

The need for the 2nd Amendment, the long long long history of law enforcement being used as a tool of oppression and enforcement of the institution of slavery, the use of racism to divide exploited whites from exploited blacks.

  
All of that fucking whitewashed in public education. The US will never overcome the legacy of slavery so long as its citizens mostly grow up thinking that slavery was this thing that got resolved in 1865 and then blacks got their rights in 1965 and I never owned slaves so the problem has been solved."

It’s beyond ridiculous but not surprising

Racism and oppression will never cease to exist as long as Capitalism lives. Capitalists need racism to thrive as the more oppressed people there are, the more poor they are, the more private prisons get filled and that means cheap labor and more profits for the leeches.

""....he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to  get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering  medical distress""

he also was already handcuffed, and suffering from a medical distress, meaning that he was obviously neutralized. So while he was laying on the ground, neutralized and handcuffed, the cop continued crushing his windpipe eventually killing him. Do you genuinely think this is legitimate?

3540,gr0y5n,"Resisting arrest isn't an offense punishable by murder.

Well, capitalism needs some type of bigotry and oppression to survive. It doesn't necessarily need to be racism. Any readily identifiable trait can be used for the basis of discrimination, preferably a trait people are born with and can't easily change. Doesn't even have to be a physical trait. Even if everyone actually was physically equal, you could still have arbitrary class distinctions reinforced by differences in upbringing and education that make it difficult for a lower class person to pass as an upper class person.

First I'm guessing that this guy died from some cardiac event.  They'll likely find that it had nothing to do with the neck pressure.  That certainly would not have stopped me from breathing.

With all of that, I too was angry that the cop maintained his posture on that man for no visible reason.  My impulse was too shout at him ""get the F off of him, he is no longer a danger to anyone"".  The Asian cop standing to the side wasn't trying to fix the issue, either, so I was wondering if there was some issue that I could not see.
At first blush, I did not approve of the handling of this.  The officer probably didn't believe the guy on the ground (about the breathing issue), and did not suspect a serious, underlying medical issue.... but good grief.  It was positively annoying that the cop lingered on that man for so long after the ""threat"" ended.

It is true that he might've died from the medical distress that he was having  but when an at least 80kg person forcefully kneels on your throat for a long period of time, its highly plausible that you'll get your windpipe crushed or just choke and die, but we can't know for sure, at least for now. What we can know is that having an at least 80kg person forcefully kneel on your throat while you're having a medical distress will certainly make it so much worse and make the odds of you dying from the medical distress so much higher, and that's when we're ignoring the fact that they didn't even try to help him.

&#x200B;

>The officer probably didn't believe the guy on the ground (about the  breathing issue), and did not suspect a serious, underlying medical  issue

He did, the officers called an ambulance.

""...Officers were able  to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering  medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance""

But for some reason, i really just have no idea why(hint: it's because he's racist and the suspect is black) the officer decided to forcefully kneel on the guy's neck, even after acknowledging that he's having a medical issue and is no longer a threat.

&#x200B;

>It was positively annoying that the cop lingered on that man for so long after the ""threat"" ended

I'm glad that you can see that this was an unjustifiable, inhumane and disgusting use of force.

&#x200B;

>these situations are so rare is, actually, quite amazing

This is horrendously untrue. I *could*  list the hundreds of incidents such as these by name so you can google them and watch cops brutally murder people(mostly black) for nothing(often facing no legal consequences), but I'll save you the time and mental sorrow of doing this and just share a statistic:

[https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/)

This obviously points to a systemic issue within the police forces. (that also goes hand in hand with the prison industrial complex and just plane systemic racism)

&#x200B;

>There are incompetent cops

Truth is, the majority of cops are incompetent. This is why we need them out of our streets, the police should work just like the fire department in terms of providing service. The police force should also be demilitarized, asap. Oh and, cops [shouldn't be rejected for having  high IQ](https://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836).

The police force is a racist and corrupt institution through and through. example: [Blacks are getting arrested for marijuana possession 8x more than whites despite consuming almost identical amounts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/)

And I'm sure you can find countless more examples if you just google ""police corruption"", ""police racism"" or similar terms.

3628,gr0y5n,[deleted]
3629,gr0y5n,Every black leftist you know has had very little to say??and I almost thought you were engaging in good faith for a moment. Night night
3630,gr0y5n,"The same reason photographers covered Vietnam and Iraq and Afghanistan and Syria and Yemen... the world needs to know of the atrocities committed by the police state. Why are you taking your anger out in this r/ ? Pick your battle with the cops that allowed this photograph to be possible in the first place... as the saying goes, don’t shoot the messenger."
3631,gx5t2f,Wtf happened here
3632,gx5t2f,I love it when they use police brutality against people that are peacefully protesting police brutality. It’s truly on another level of intellect.
3633,gx5t2f,lol facts
3634,gx5t2f,[removed]
3635,gx5t2f,[deleted]
3636,gx5t2f,How is it irony if the subject of the irony isn’t actually saying it?
3637,gx5t2f,Fascists think they can come here and argue in favour of fascism.
3638,gx5t2f,"ACAM

Either they are conspiring or committing"
3639,gx5t2f,This but unironically
3640,gx5t2f,[some epic facts](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/19/nine-10-home-burglaries-now-go-unsolved-effective-police-force/amp/)
3641,gx5t2f,"I called the cops when my house was broken into... because I had to in order to complete the insurance claim. That is literally the only useful thing they did. They filled out a report for my insurance.

Otherwise, they didn’t defend my house, they didn’t defend my property, they didn’t defend me. They didn’t catch anyone, either. I even showed them how the footprints in my yard led from the broken sliding door, to the wall, and how you could see footprints leading across the field. They didn’t care.

So, you’ll have to excuse me for thinking cops are fucking useless. That’s why I’m armed and I know how to use my guns."
3642,gx5t2f,You can hate cops while doing other things
3643,gx5t2f,"If you like cops so much why don't you go tell them that at any peaceful BLM protest? Hol up, considering your username you might already be there in full riot gear."
3644,gx5t2f,"I surely know who shows up and completely escalates the situation when my mom is in an acute dissociative state and needs urgent mental help. I also know who beats me into their car, when I ask them to take it easy and let the medical staff do their work."
3645,gx5t2f,People get shot at by police for protesting against police brutality
3646,gx5t2f,">ACAM
>Either they are conspiring or committing

Even the black ones?"
3647,gx5t2f,"Wow, that's all you could comment on, I was giving an example"
3648,gx5t2f,"There could literally be school children being slaughtered wholesale inside of a school by a maniac and they will stand on the sidelines, hesitant to enter because they fear for their own lives. Hell, they’ll even hide in closets if they’re in the school. 

But when there are peaceful protesters? Box them in parking garages, shoot foam rounds at their heads, and beat the elderly. 

The only mistake the protesters made was showing up unarmed. The police only seem to show restraint and hesitation when their lives may be in danger from doing something."
3649,gx5t2f,"That's treu, you can also hate only some cops whilst doing other things"
3650,gx5t2f,👍
3651,gx5t2f,I think looting stores and murdering people (David Dorm) has something to do with that
3652,gx5t2f,"Yes, even the black ones"
3653,gx5t2f,The color of the badge doesn't matter.
3654,gx5t2f,ALL
3655,gx5t2f,Hold up you can't try to back up out of that. You gave an example and then you were shown how that example is flawed so now you either you need a counter argument or concede.
3656,gx5t2f,"But it's all like this. 
They don't help with domestic violence.
They don't help with sexual assault.
They don't help with community outreach. 
They don't help with school safety. 
All these examples and more are ways the police involvement makes everything *worse.* 

Can you show data where police presence makes things safer?"
3657,gx5t2f,But all cops enforce unjust laws and so we have to include them all.
3658,gx5t2f,ACAB
3659,gx5t2f,Therefore the police is clear to shoot journalists and gas peaceful protestors
3660,gx5t2f,Hmmmm 🤔
3661,gx5t2f,"Once again, how exactly are they peaceful? They literally killed a black man when ""protesting"" police violence. The absurdity here is beyond comprehensible"
3662,gx5t2f,You tried to catch someone up and you failed and you're still going to act high and mighty
3663,gx5t2f,You ever stop to think there might be more going on than random riots? And that journalists getting shot and non violent suspects getting choked to death might be a problem?
3664,gx5t2f,"I mean, what he said obviously isn't true so he caught caught himself."
3665,gx5t2f,Never said it's not a problem. My point was that these protestors are by no means peaceful and the police gets unreasonable amount of hate
3666,gx5t2f,"What do you mean it obviously isn't true? Black cops are holding the line and using lethal force along with the rest of them. Or are you unaware of the predatory and exploitive treatment of Black officers? 

Google is free dude."
3667,gx5t2f,Property damage>murders being covered up
3668,gx5t2f,">...using lethal force along with the rest of them

All of them? 

>Google is free dude

Nothing is free, and I'm not your dude. 😉"
3669,gx5t2f,"The thing I can't understand is how will you stop racism by vandalizing entire neighborhoods, by looting stores and by killing people"
3670,gx5t2f,"No, you're not a dude to any of us. 

You're an asshole."
3671,gx5t2f,"
>All of them? 

Yes dude, look it up. Cops that aren't participating are the ones quiting. 

>Nothing is free, and I'm not your dude. 😉 

Bruh if you're wondering why no one likes you it's because you need to stop saying things like this, my guy."
3672,gx5t2f,"Good point. I guess the police is justified and should choke more people to death in the street and blind more journalists and they should all take it lying down. After all, not a single peaceful protest has taken place.

Maybe Trump can even send the riot police to another church to forcibly remove the protest there along with the priests so he can take another picture where he awkwardly holds a bible. But not before threatening to send in the military to shoot protestors, of course.

And obviously, vandalism is much more harmful than so-called law enforcement casually murdering people in the street without consequence."
3673,eopdwa,The foundation to a functioning democracy is an educated public. No surprise GoP and the Tories aren't interested in improving free education for the public.
3674,eopdwa,Education is the greatest weapon against fascism.
3675,eopdwa,Isn't it amazing what so much intelligence and so little wisdom can produce?
3676,eopdwa,It’s weird how many republicans post good ideas without realizing it. Self aware wolves to the max.

3679,eopdwa,"""The secret to freedom is educating the people, whereas the secret to tyranny is keeping them ignorant.""- Maximilien Robespierre."

3700,eopdwa,"Well, this only proves that Nazism and Trumpism can be correlated with lack of education. Education is apolitical. What does for example Calculus have with politics?"

3764,eopdwa,"Don’t disagree, but this post blatantly, obvoiously, expressly says that this would be a good thing."
3765,eopdwa,"Well capitalism runs out country and they decide the curriculum so it's to be expected, but more educated people tend to move left anyway especially if they study history and recognize that the history is written by the victors."
3766,eopdwa,"Higher, and good, education is the main recruitment pool for leftists too.

&#x200B;

I take it you're an anarchist (libleft myself). How did you end up there? By reading theory and seeking out knowledge?

&#x200B;

Poorly educated people don't do that"
3767,eopdwa,Do you use this to justify being a moron?
3768,eopdwa,The horror
3769,eopdwa,"Shits crazy. A pizzeria in my town just got into a bunch of shit for antisemetic remarks towards a delivery driver. Apparently the driver asked for a day off since it was a Jewish holiday. The owner went on to text him things like all of his kind should be dead and “Hitler was right”. Was all over the news. Drove by the place and there was a long note to the customers saying they were “devastated by the recent occurrence” and that they apologize to their “Jewish customers”.

I’ll forever associate the place with nazis now. Never went there in the first place but still. Nuts to see this still going on. One might think trump made America racist again"
3770,eopdwa,[removed]
3771,eopdwa,"No it isnt.. have you heard of tanks and jets and helos? A gun isnt going to do shit, dummy."
3772,eopdwa,I agree! But we must be better than them.
3773,eopdwa,"I mean, I definitely said I thought the uniforms were cool once.

And I still think every Nazi should be dead."
3774,eopdwa,[deleted]
3775,eopdwa,I fucking love Woodie Guthrie for real though.
3776,eopdwa,"""There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me, sign was painted, said ""private property"". But on the back-side it didn't say nothin'. This land was made for you and me""

""Throw your hands in the air 'cause property is robbery!"""
3777,eopdwa,Intellectual overconfidence describes them so well.
3778,eopdwa,He had some basic good ideas which are a trick to get people to listen to his shit opinions and apologetics to defend positions that simply ad up to wanting to be an asshole and say you're just being true to your beliefs.
3779,eopdwa,"Shapiro graduated highschool young and earned honors at UCLA and Harvard Law. I mean, he's arrogant and pompous and a total asshole with absolute shit opinions about everything, but to call him unintelligent is just wrong."
3780,eopdwa,I am sure you are much more intelligent than him.
3781,eopdwa,You *hypothetically* have pictures of AOC’s feet...
3782,eopdwa,Yummy yummy
3783,eopdwa,"bruh go have some canteloupe, pineapple, and tomato and get back to me on how it tastes"
3784,eopdwa,A fair point. The thing to remember when trying to talk to people like climate change denialists is rational reasoning probably didn't get them into that belief so it's unlikely to get them out since everyone - especially on the internet - sees their [arguments as soldiers](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Arguments_as_soldiers) to be defended at all costs.
3785,eopdwa,Or because you want to educate yourself and broaden your perspective on life.
3786,eopdwa,It's a German saying my dude. Or are you saying you know the Nazis better than the people who had to live under their regime?
3787,eopdwa,"If you're associating with Nazis, you look pretty guilty to me."
3788,eopdwa,"Oh boy, lol."
3789,eopdwa,"Nazis weren't and aren't socialist. Socialists were some of the first people they got rid of. They only called themselves ""national socialists"" to get certain voting blocks behind them."
3790,eopdwa,">Nazis are socialist.

Do you know what mass privatisation means? Because that term was specifically coined to describe the economic policy of the Nazis."
3791,eopdwa,No.
3792,eopdwa,[removed]
3793,eopdwa,this but unironically
3794,eopdwa,true enough
3795,eopdwa,Damn i wish my name was Victor so i could write some history
3796,eopdwa,"In my experience college was mostly libs peddling center- right bs and either having an irrational hatred for the left or refusing to discusss it in their classes at all. This doesn’t mean college doesn’t have its benefits, but we shouldn’t pretend that universities are above reproach simply because the far right criticizes them for some pretty dumb reasons. The same goes for the media. And yes, I use all this to justify being a moron."
3797,eopdwa,"You're the one who wants to equate ""give everyone the opportunity to go to college"" with ""indoctrinate everyone equally to think 'correctly'"" 

There is no centralized ideology I am aware of outside ""fascism is bad"" which is hardly a new idea."
3798,eopdwa,"Look it, if you take the second amendment literally it’s not just about guns, it says well regulated militia. In other words, by the letter we should have tanks and jets and helos too

Edit: forgot how to spell"
3799,eopdwa,"Does sombody have that copypasta handy?

Basically, those weapons require significant fragile infrastructure to operate, are only useful for certain things, and are helpless against an insurgency. A jet can't do anything if it doesn't have a specific target far from anything else the operator doesn't want to hit."
3800,eopdwa,Being better than them does not preclude self defence
3801,eopdwa,"fuck that noise. the only good nazi is... oh, no, wait, there are no good nazis. even dead nazis are shit. they're just slightly less shit cause they're dead"
3802,eopdwa,Not being fascist makes you better than them. Next.
3803,eopdwa,"You can try to reeducate, sure, but if someone wants to commit genocide against minorities I have 0 qualms about killing them"
3804,eopdwa,"Nah, hang the fascists from meathooks. 

&#x200B;

There is ideological disagreements and harsh conflict over ideology, and then there is wishing all your political opponents dead because your ideology is a suicide cult who have a raging hardon for violence and murder

&#x200B;

Me ne frego about dead nazis"
3805,eopdwa,"I agree, fascists should be stopped before they obtain firearms, using lethal force if necessary.  

If they already have firearms, well...cowabunga it is then."
3806,eopdwa,"Yes, regular range time is critical."
3807,eopdwa,"No real problem in thinking these things, but art is definitely a tool for both good and evil."
3808,eopdwa,"Yeah, SS uniforms are damn cool, because they were well designed propaganda tools."
3809,eopdwa,It's all orchestra music and fasicst song
3810,eopdwa,"Intelligence and education are two completely different things.

There is a German word for this: ""Fachidiot"" which literally translates to ""subject idiot"".  
It describes someone who excels in one specific field, but is otherwise a complete idiot."
3811,eopdwa,And let's say... What... Maybe... 60% are taken from the top.
3812,eopdwa,I never expected a Wiggles reference...anywhere.
3813,eopdwa,It’s a bad saying regardless of who proliferated it. Guilt by association is some thoughtcrime shit.
3814,eopdwa,[removed]
3815,eopdwa,I can get behind this
3816,eopdwa,"Dude, you underestimate the shit the USA military can do, especially with their batshit insane funding. And if they want, they can just carpetbomb the places with a lot of revolters, even if peaceful people are in the vicinity, they have proved they don't give much if a shit about killing civilians before"
3817,eopdwa,"Lol oh ok, a bunch of redneck grade 9 grads are going to take out the military lmao."
3818,eopdwa,Dead nazis are best used for market-square decorations in Italy
3819,eopdwa,Dead nazis all go too hell.
3820,eopdwa,Genocide on the genocidal?
3821,eopdwa,I love the Germans they have a word for everything
3822,eopdwa,I don't necessarily think so. I think up thread they had it right: that the divide lies between intelligence and wisdom.
3823,eopdwa,Just for the sake of argument... you give me those AOC feet pics...
3824,eopdwa,"If you're associating with people who have views like ""we should genocide this group because they're subhuman"" by choice then it seems perfectly fair to judge you for associating with that group. It's not guilt by association, it's aiding and abetting. All that evil requires is that good men stand by and do nothing, as the saying goes."
3825,eopdwa,[deleted]
3826,eopdwa,u/userleansbot
3827,eopdwa,Your profile shows that you’re a trump supporter
3828,eopdwa,"They say for every innocent that gets killed you make forty hostiles, and I did mention all of the fragile and critical infrastructure, right? If they carpet bomb all of their cities that doesn't actually help them."
3829,eopdwa,"Yes the American military has *never* had trouble defeating technologically inferior opponents before have they

Never ever"
3830,eopdwa,"An insurgency is a population rising up in revolt

&#x200B;

How will the US army beat down an armed insurrection *on home soil?*

Friends, family, people of your own skin colour, speaking your language, rising up in revolt versus the tyrannical govt. the second amendment speaks of? Shooting your neighbour is way harder than an arab or vietnamese dude you have been brainwashed to hate"
3831,eopdwa,The day the first Nazi died is the day Satan had to break ground on circle \#10
3832,eopdwa,"It's not really genocide but yeah. There's a difference between killing or opposing people because they exist and killing and opposing people for wanting to kill people for existing. If we let fascists exist for the sake of ""tolerance"" or whatever, they will use that to oppress and kill minorities"
3833,eopdwa,"and if not, we'll just make something up"
3834,eopdwa,Interviewer: so how does this relate to rap not being music?
3835,eopdwa,I suppose that’s fair. Certainly if they ever discuss those views.
3836,eopdwa,I didn't say the subreddit was fascist. Just the previous comment for advocating violence against those with separate opinions.

3838,eopdwa,I'm still not voting for Trump. Regardless of how I politically lean.
3839,eopdwa,Find a quote of me saying I am.
3840,eopdwa,Americans when the apple pies start speaking american
3841,eopdwa,Which is why they have been actively trying to dehumanize left wing political ideas. It’s easier to shoot your brother if you believe he’s been turned into a monster by having different ideals and priorities than you.
3842,eopdwa,Yeah fascists are best used for town square decorations
3843,eopdwa,*JUST GIVE ME THE AOC FEET PICS!*
3844,eopdwa,"True, I am definitely conservative and I hate fake news. But, I'm still not a Republican or a Trump supporter."
3845,eopdwa,You’re literally only active in r/conservative just because you didn’t announce something obvious doesn’t mean it isn’t true. You buttknuckle
3846,eopdwa,Being conservative does not mean I am Republican or a Trump supporter. I've never voted Republican. The articles I posted on r/conservative were all unbiased sources to stimulate conversation about the topics.
3847,hd8x3o,Please generously censor faces and clothes of protesters.
3848,hd8x3o,"In USA, system fucks you"
3849,hd8x3o,"Well shoot, I missed this one!

Where are you getting info for upcoming protests in SD?"
3850,hd8x3o,Seize the means of seduction?

3862,hd8x3o,"Just had an imagining of a counter-protester (Ur fascist) holding a sign that reads the reverse... Projecting their red pill frustrations. Eh, all too plausible."
3863,hd8x3o,"Yep, I’m doing it right now! Lol"

3870,hd8x3o,I like the sound of where this is going 😏
3871,hd8x3o,Sdprotest and sandiegoprotestors on Instagram have been our go to for following the protests. They have been very good at contacting the organizers and veryifing each event.
3872,hd8x3o,I’ve seen some on Twitter @sdprotest

3886,hd8x3o,Yes too many idiots honestly believe all protestors are apart of some coordinated Antifa network of “terrorists” and other batshit crazy stuff because of our asshole president so we need to be really safe.
3887,hd8x3o,She had her picture taken on public and posted it online. Don’t stack all the blame on OP.

3895,hd8x3o,"It's important to be careful with people's identities as right wing terrorist groups will at minimum harass people online, and can fuether escalate it to doxxing and sending death threats to their home address and finally committing violent acts against them. So even if the person is being cavalier about their identity, I think it's important when posting pictures to protect everyone's identity."

Undercover cops have infiltrated right wing groups and put people in jail for trying to kill so called Antifa members. I wish it was a joke, but this is the world we are living in. Also virtually everyone who is identified by right wing groups at minimum has death threats deliveried to their address and these people have to constantly move to avoid harassment.

3924,hd8x3o,Ah.
3925,j3k4y4,Literally had someone in my DMs today telling me that I was a sheep and spewing hate for saying he was a murderer. According to them he was “scared for his life” 🙄🙄🙄🙄
3926,j3k4y4,"Damn, is she 17 already? The last four years seem like both an eternity and a flash. Trauma from constitutional crises will do that to you."
3927,j3k4y4,Someone literally called me an idiot for saying that Kyle is a terrorist and that trump is encouraging his voters to commit voter fraud. Of course they’re all alt right nazis. I got them to resort to using the n word and saying shit like “you trans idiot” even though I’m not. Fuck the alt right
3928,j3k4y4,The reality is that this kid is going to be turned into a nazi in prison. He’s going to be much worse getting out than he was going in

3931,j3k4y4,I got family in Kenosha and actually you’d be surprised how many Democrats think he’s a hero too. It’s fucking crazy. Wisconsin is one confused state right now.
3932,j3k4y4,But one of the guys Rittenhouse killed had 18 year old priors... it's cool to extra judicial kill people for crimes they already served a sentence for right?
3933,j3k4y4,Still waiting for Greta to read the bread book
3934,j3k4y4,"It feels surreal, seeing these two side by side, and thinking how close they are to my current age. I can't quite grasp what it is."
3935,j3k4y4,"It's OK to call out these sheep. But don't you dare call out the sheep who think it was OK for the DNC to rig the 2016 primary. If you call out THOSE sheep, they all bleat, ""Trump supporter!"" in unison until you vomit."
3936,j3k4y4,Well she’s not a democrat... she’s not even American
3937,j3k4y4,"What gave this kid the right to kill people when he’s can’t even take responsibility? Murderers who cannot and will not take responsibility for their actions should be forced to donate organs or be tested on, that’s the only use they have for society..."
3938,j3k4y4,I told some trumpers today rallying across from my bus stop 'Fuck Trump!'  Felt good not going to change thier mind anyways so may as well express what i think of thier president.
3939,j3k4y4,Sorry my phone was broken for the last few days and I only just got a replacement. What the hell happened?
3940,j3k4y4,Doesn’t Greta suffer from FAS?
3941,j3k4y4,"""hes a patriot and a victim! He shot a pedo and criminal!!!""

Did the people that fought him have labels and signs on them stating what their crimes are?

These people are mentally unstable. 

""How DARE Biden go after Kyle! An american hero!!"""

3962,j3k4y4,"Nazi ≠ people you don’t like

There are very well organized fascist organizations based in the DOC. Not “Trump is a fascist!” I’m talking about the Aryan Brotherhood recruiting young people with long sentences. By the time he’s paroled, if ever, he’ll have been a member for nearly his entire adult life. That means he’ll be **worse** off than he is now. A few years of being exposed to far right propaganda online is nothing compared to the multiple decades of hell this kid is about to be subjected to.

The AB is by far the largest Fascist organization in the United States. They have tens of thousands of members both on the inside & in the streets, as well as a presence in the armed forces. This kid is their ideal new recruit."

Again i live here and you dont and you said you have family here? i have family friends coworkers people from my hobbies and me just goofing off around town i would say the one living in an echo chamber is the one not living here not talking to the people and relaying things they heard 2nd hand from family like a shitty game of telephone.

4028,j3k4y4,r/enlightenedcentrist is a subreddit that thinks the spectrum of life doesn’t have a middle and there will never be cohesion because they came up with the words enlightenedcentrist. Just because someone wrote about it doesn’t mean there isn’t someone willing to back it up. Usually the middle is the best way to go and anyone who tells you otherwise will tell you the same about anything else.
4029,j3k4y4,There are many interpretations of this comment.  What do you mean?
4030,j3k4y4,"Just some kid casually walking around with an assault rifle in the middle of a protest, you know, just some kid using said assault rifle to murder unarmed protesters. Just some kid doing normal kid stuff."
4031,j3k4y4,"Everything stems from one fact: he didn't need to be there. No logic states he had to be there.

Property, things, items, **objects**; those can be replaced.

The lives taken by Kyle? They're gone. They're just gone. Because one kid couldn't stay the fuck at home."
4032,j3k4y4,The vindictive and vengeful side of me wants people to make him feel afraid and spend every waking minute looking over his shoulder and regretting but ik that just plays into the idea of the violent left. Fuck is it hard not to have thoughts like that sometimes though
4033,j3k4y4,There are no republicans left. The last one died of brain cancer.
4034,j3k4y4,"Yeah. That's the point I'm making. He didn't have to be at a riot to defend property. He could have stayed home. Might he have lost his job if the place got burned down? Yeah. Does that suck? Yeah.  


Does that mean that completely clears **any** fault from him for **shooting people**? No. Does that clear him of the ***crime*** of having had a weapon that was not his, and was illegal for him to carry considering Wisconsin's laws? No.  


Don't equate this to rape victims, you prick."
4035,j3k4y4,Everytime I say that to someone they just say “but can you prove that” “you can’t prove he wanted to kill anyone” and then I’m like uhhh you can’t prove he didn’t wanna kill anyone and then we’re stuck in this circular argument for like at least 2 more beers before one of us leaves lol
4036,j3k4y4,Would I carry a concealed gun to protect myself? absolutely. Would I ever be walking around with a visable AR strapped to me? Fuck no. Would I ever have any intent to kill anyone no fucking way in hell. I agree with you completely carrying around and showing off that gun like that was asking for trouble.

4090,j3k4y4,"It depends on your perspective, leftist countries do become authoritarian, I'm going to get banned for this but it is due to fear of counter revolutionaries and other anti communist elements which would undo everything the revolution achieved. A check on power of other parties within a leftist country should be kept for as long as 20 years to prevent counter revolutions such as those during the formation of the USSR. 


On the other hand, I believe fascism is more akin to the right as right wing ideologies form the basis for fascism (Keep all the ethnicities segregated, be proud of your patriarchal culture etc.), Left wing tries to remove all these to create a society where people would not try to create the same conditions under Hitler or Mussolini."

It's the system that makes cops (some) bastards, and that I believe is the original message of the slogan. I believe we need good cops, but it is only possible within a system where cops aren't armed like the military or taught to shoot until the suspect stops running. 


Similarly, all parties aren't bad, the American two party system is, it forces us to choose between two conservative parties, one of which is ""We hate the working class 🏳️‍🌈 # BLM"", while the other is ""We hate the working class 🇺🇸"", both are a result of the system which has been in place since the US got independence."

4225,gupel6,"“Many non-slaveholding whites in the South rented slaves from wealthier slaveholders... so it was very common for a white Southerner to be a ‘slave master’ but not technically a ‘slave owner’”

Conclusion: 2% is a gross underestimation of the wide spread slavery in the south.

According to https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/aug/24/viral-image/viral-post-gets-it-wrong-extent-slavery-1860/ and many other sources, ~30% of white southern families owned slaves in 1860. That nearly accounts for all wealthy white southern descendants that are around today.

4297,gupel6,"Except it's not. We will fight fascism at any cost. This includes homophobic, segregationist, bombing brown children, fracking Joe Biden."
4298,gupel6,"At all costs means even if you have to compromise a value. That is one of the many costs. Be careful tho, saying things like this here doesn't seem to go over well."
4299,gupel6,"No, he needs to be less of a fascist.  It’s that fucking simple, goose."
4300,gupel6,Cool enjoy how that holding Biden to account goes once he knows you'll vote for him as long as there's a worse republican running against him...
4301,gupel6,"Exactly.  I can’t stand the idiots that say “I don’t know, Biden hasn’t really earned my vote.... he doesn’t support seizing the means of production.”  The fuck?  

Anti fascists should obviously vote for the candidate that isn’t a fascist."
4302,gupel6,"As far as I know there are only allegations against Biden of making sexual assault, nothing has been proven yet. This is like calling Che Guevara a mass murderer because he reviewed war crimes of certain I dividuals but couldn't sentence anyone. Or like calling Che  homophobic, even though there is no evidence for it. 

Joe Biden was against busing because he deemed it to enable more racial tension, same as Bernie said in an interview 30,40 years ago. Biden was more in support of addressing issues such as housing inequality which was one of the main reasons for segregation, but he even did support busing couple of times. 

Biden also supports the protests, he called out trump and criticised him for inciting violence and for threatening the protesters with violence. Biden was also in the streets talking to protesters. Biden condemned police brutality as well. Guess who didn't do that... Trump.

Biden also shifted his policies more to Bernies policies from which a lot of people would surely benefit. And Biden is supported by minorities which clearly shows that they need those reforms he is advocating for."
4303,gupel6,"In the Spanish civil war liberals sided with the Republican cause. Liberal countries   even went to war with Nazi Germany in 1939. when the Soviets signed an alliance with Germany. The Weimar Republic is a great example, because various factions were at each others throats. Communists branded the Social Democrats as fascists, social Democrats branded the communists as fascists. Communists leader even had a slogan ""after Hitler our turn"" because he believe dnazis to be a better alternative to social democracy, he thought that nazism would collapse soon as it assumed control. Things turned out differently. After nazis assumed power the communists and social Democrats realised their mistakes and prepared for a joint protest but it was too late at that time. 

History is not black and white, and its more complex than ""liberals enabling fascists"". Liberals are opposed to both ideologies that doesn't mean they endorse fascism. Just as Leon Trotsky said before the 1933 election, social Democrats should be our temporary allies against a greater evil."
4304,gupel6,"But Bernie  Sanders pushed Biden to the left, his policies are even more left that before."

Literally no such thing. Educate yourself.  

> have committed acts of domestic terrorism.  

Even if true (source?) that says roughly nothing about other anti-fascists.  

> Antifa is not morally superior  

If you don't think being against fascism is morally superior to fascism you are part of the reason antifa exists.  

> regardless of it's intentions  

There's only one intention, oppose fascism in any way you feel comfortable. Some become politically active, some spread awareness through (social) media, and yes some punch nazis and commit terrorism against them. You can choose to disapprove of that, but remember that antifa is merely the effect and fascism is the cause. Without fascism there would be no anti-fascism and there would be no punching nazis in the name of antifa.  

> Extremists on any side are bad.  

Very true.  

> Antifa has made their group an extremist one.  

Not so true. Antifa is not one group, they are not governed, they don't regulate themselves and they differ greatly in ideology. I am antifa, yet I have never commit a terrorist act and I've only ever been in fights I didn't provoke myself. There are always extremists, and they are always bad. But there aren't nearly as much extremist anti-fascists as extremist fascists, and even if there were it still wouldn't say anything about the rest, one extremist individual does not speak for the collective. Just take a look at the world, we have a shitshow in the middle east with various terrorist organizations which are _all_ fascist movements. We have authoritarian governments in the east which are fascist. We even have popular leaders with fascist tendencies in the west. Fascism is still big, and so antifa is still necessary."

4499,eruya4,"The thing is the nazis will literally try parading in the streets with their various flags out for everyone to see on the premise of ""removing"" minorities, so they're not exactly hard to find, they're identifying themselves quite clearly. The ones who actually try hiding themselves are also getting exposed by Antifa's doxxing campaign, which is way more effective against them than being beat up at some hate rally. Antifa doesn't go around finding random people, calling them nazis, and beating them up."

4513,eruya4,"Yes. The student (Scout Schulz) engaged in suicide by cop by calling in a report of a dangerous individual wielding a knife. After the officers were deployed, he continued to approach an officer who had his weapon drawn, and the officer was forced to use his firearm. The officer's action was not only policy in those situations, but in my opinion a reasonable (albeit incredibly difficult) act of self defense. Even though Scout was clearly having a mental breakdown, for all the officer knew he may have attacked the officer to further provoke his suicide (and remember in Scout's own 911 call, he claimed to have a knife, even though he actually did not).

Prior to that night, not only had GTPD never killed anyone, they had never even fired a shot before. They also did not carry tasers. Something like this was completely unprecedented.

Bottom line is Scout wanted to die and forced another human being to make it happen. Next thing you know, Antifa wanted to play hero and caused a shit storm on our campus, furthering the emotional hurt in our student body that year.

It was an extremely sad situation and I actually worked with Scout at a philanthropy event a few weeks prior to his death."

He exhibits classic denialist and conspiracy theory tropes: all the real evidence is purged or missing and all the evidence to the contrary is forged or irrelevant. Lack of evidence is explained away as being part of the conspiracy. He relies on a sympathetic ear and an unwillingness to actually follow up on sources to be taken seriously by anybody.

Isn't that what people on the right are doing nowadays? Cherrypicking evidence and being extremely sloppy when it comes to citations? No follow up through sources is something I see constantly. Hell a lefty just last week tried giving me a piece they couldn't read but said it supported their side."

So, basically people who use snowflake as an insult are quoting a domestic terrorist who blows up skyscrapers because he's insecure about how good he is in bed.

As for actual academia, historians are pretty honest and rigorous, especially the acclaimed ones. The commenter I replied to implies that actual academia cannot be trusted, and instead, in his post history cites Furr to do USSR and Stalin apologia.

Not even a website. All I’ve found is a couple of articles talking about terrorism in various parts of the world and how a company called “ExeIntel Group a private investigation company handed over details”

A deeper look at her account suggests that many of her “followers” are fake accounts, possibly bots. 

Finally, [@econbrkfst](https://twitter.com/econbrkfst) on Twitter did some **excellent** investigatory work into the account of the “CEO of ExeIntel Group” it’s a long thread [but I recommend you reading it](https://twitter.com/econbrkfst/status/1223985814817783808?s=21) as it’s brilliant.

4754,hcl4eq,">As for actual academia, historians are pretty honest and rigorous, especially the acclaimed ones.

I took a class on Urban History. I was with the chair of the department. We read a piece from *The Origins of the Urban Crisis* by Thomas Sugrue about how white communities resisted integration in the suburbs through the use of Home Owner Associations white's resisted ""liberalization"" and blacks moving into their neighborhoods. Specifically Sugrue looked at Detroit but one could with primary sources build an argument for any city. 

During our class discussion my professor told us about a paper he was working on. He was looking at the same issue but in Philadelphia and the formation of ""Neighborhood Watches."" Who did he find as a member of a neighborhood watch? Sugrue. 

It must be an integral part of any historian to research and understand who they are using as a source. If I go to put something in a conference paper I go ask my colleagues, ""Hey, do you know anything about this?"" I still chose to use a known Denver Marxist historian as a source because well fuck in this instance he did his damn job in giving me a map of how Denver's streets used to be.

 In writing history you need to be able to place yourself in context of other sources. Furr is a wackjob but he can give you something for a line of sources to argue against. That sounds like to me a fun summer project to work on. To be like,

Of course that doesn't really matter either, cause even when we all just vote for the less shitty person and win the vote, the electoral College votes for whoever they want and they get to win anyway.

I would tend to think it's more the former than the latter, but I agree that both of these things are certainly contributors

> Not against Trump's dumbfuckery, nor against the Dems' means tested bandages on the system's infested wounds.

What I'd say is, when Trump says ""this thing bad"", true believers are going to eat it like the dogs they are, but skeptics, even people that don't know what anti-fascism is, are going to pause for a second and say, huhn, well, this guy hates ""antifa"" but, I can't stand this guy

If that gets even one more person to look into what ""antifa"" actually means, and thinks ""oh, somebody against fascism, I don't support fascism, maybe I'm antifa?"" 

To be clear to, I'm pretty sure bumblefuck in chief's rants against anti-fascism aren't just going to get one person to think a little more carefully about the political process

Now we can just hope to keep gaining momentum, rather than allowing it to fizzle out like it sadly has in the past.."
4838,gzb833,"That just sounds like misunderstanding of socialism - they (everyday people) don't need to sacrifice any of that stuff.

Those who do need to 'sacrifice' material stuff are the capitalists, and you're right, unless we use force, they won't, so we use fucking force."
4839,gzb833,Add call your congress person to that list.  Calls are the most effective - download the 5calls app - it literally dials the numbers for you daily.
4840,gzb833,"You could also do other things for folx like making food to take to folx in the Black communities around you, protesters, etc. You can make sure any of your friends or others you know that are protesting have important information needed (from live-streams, police scanners, or others sharing information). Call your mayor and other elected officials to demand change. As an immunocompromised individual myself, I have tried to find the ways I can offer support other than physically being out there. We have options! Keep sharing important information and keep signing petitions, also add in what other ways feel right. Just because we aren’t out there physically doesn’t mean we aren’t offering important support. Also, look for protests that are requesting folx show up with their vehicles! That’s a great way to be out there and maintain distance from others, plus a vehicle is a great way to get between the cops and Black folx."

4847,gzb833,No i can't even find one. The Homophobia is really this hard. It funny that my country Indonesia is a model for a tolerant nation. Not a lot of people know that is a complete government propaganda. You have to be brainwashed to think that Homophobia is tolerance. But 90% of Indonesian believe in that We Happy Few lies.

4976,dyx61b,I get the feeling they know that chuds like them without paying attention to their lyrics so they drew the line real quick to make their stance clear

5007,dyx61b,"Some guy on Reddit tried to use the “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me” line to justify transphobia and not using the right pronouns. I pointed out that RATM are left wing and would support trans rights, immediately got downvoted."

5018,dyx61b,Bulls on parade is great
5019,dyx61b,"This is an issue with all punk right wing fans. They never listen to the lyrics, but when the band post atleast one song that directly attacks something like racism or a bigot president, they suddenly go ‘wow can’t believe they went so political they were better when they weren’t’"

5023,dyx61b,Figuratively speaking of course
5024,dyx61b,"Tom mentioned it in some interview and I agree. They aren‘t interested in preaching to the choir. If their messages reach a ton of people who wouldn‘t be exposed to it otherwise, it‘s a win. In a capitalist society the delivery of anti-capitalist messaging through media to a large audience will inevitably go through the channels of capital."
5025,dyx61b,"Yes, all the tour locations are on the way there."
5026,dyx61b,Ya nothing says raging against the machine like $400 concert tickets.
5027,dyx61b,"Exactly, they “sell” you back a view that was never yours in the first place under the guise of “artist” but they all want that money regardless of their hardline political views. #evenRATMarecapitalistfasciats #fuckyoujustdowhatwetellyou"
5028,dyx61b,"Seems to be split down the middle. 

I recall a video going viral last year of a black dude KOing a Nazi who was spewing vitriol somewhere in Portland, and there was A L O T of hand-wringing over whether violence of this sort is justified. I think most Redditors believe that the best, most morally defensible way to counter those who would use their freedom of speech to express neo-fascist, white supremacists ideologies is with  open dialogue (i.e. more free speech). As such,  there was a strong contingent of Redditors who were ""both-siding"" and drawing a moral equivalence between Fascists and Anti-Facists. Their claim was (in a nutshell) that no one is in a position to determine what constitutes justifiable free speech, and anyone who would resort to violence to obstruct the free speech of Nazi's are just as concerning (if not more so) as the Nazi's themselves. 

What they completely fail to realize is that Nazisism is inherently a psychopathic genocidal ideology. Nazis  only defend free speech in bad faith - for them, it's just a tool to consolidate power, but once in power they'd have no reason to defend it, because it would only strengthen their enemies. That being the case, the ""combatting speech with speech""  trope makes no sense, because would-be Nazi's aren't interested in having a conversation - conversation is just spectacle, a tool for mainstreaming their ideology and recruiting interested onlookers - what they are truly interested in is killing you, and your friends, and your family."
5029,dyx61b,"Specifically for the admins: I got temp banned from reddit for saying that fighting Nazis is self defense, Chapo got quarantined for saying slaveowners deserved to be killed together with many users for ""threats of violence"", and so on."
5030,dyx61b,"There is this general perception that Reddit is full of Alt-Right and 'Enlightened Centerists,' even though this exact image is on the front page right now."
5031,dyx61b,[removed]
5032,dyx61b,"Yeah, but then how would OP get his updoots if he posted a normal title? Gotta farm that karma. Reddit is pretty damn liberal. The right wing/fascist type people generally keep to their own subs or get down voted to oblivion. But there's 1 thing that remains a constant and it's that Reddit loves to circlejerk and a title like this is a good way to start one."
5033,dyx61b,Dont think so
5034,dyx61b,"I dont think ive ever listen to them, but im gonna give it a shot now."
5035,dyx61b,Not really. They are objectively good and helped form a generation.
5036,dyx61b,"LOL

GNR?

GTFO."
5037,dyx61b,Ooof you got flamed for that one huh?
5038,dyx61b,"No, but I dislike them breaking up Prophets of Rage to have a reunion.

I like Prophets of Rage better than Rage Against the Machine — r/unpopularopinion."
5039,dyx61b,"Yeah, I always liked their message, but their sound always bothered me. I could never stand to listen to them for more than a song or two."
5040,dyx61b,"I used to dislike it. When they came out, I lumped them in with rap-rock and like Sublime and 311 and horseshit like that, because everyone I knew who liked RATM was also into that trash. I thought their anti capitalist stance was shtick. I thought oh wow, their guitarist uses effects pedals to make DJ scratching sounds, big fucking deal. 

Time has proven me wrong about their sincerity. They are legit. I think their mixing of rock and hip-hop elements was a lot more innovative than I gave them credit for from my limited exposure. And I was dead wrong about what Morello does on guitar. He is amazing."
5041,dyx61b,Why are you all downvoting this person for their taste in music? What the fuck?
5042,dyx61b,"Lol, downvoted for expressing your opinion on a matter of taste. Smh. Don't change reddit."

5066,dyx61b,"I’ve never understood the whole “letting them say their piece” thing, because.... haven’t we already had that discussion? Didn’t we have a whole war about it, in fact? We KNOW what their message is, there’s no point in entertaining an argument that was won decades ago."
5067,dyx61b,And yet when they get the brakes beaten off them they cooly play victim to the intolerant left. It's like we're dealing with George Lincoln Rockwell on steroids.

5071,dyx61b,"IMO There's kinda two ways to approach, Renegades would be the easier entry point, or you can crank Evil Empire.

The others are excellent, too, but those are where I'd go."
5072,dyx61b,"As in Guns N Roses? They’re one of the best bands ever, really only second to Zeppelin. The AFD lineup of Guns had one of the most talented vocalists ever, an instantly recognizable lead guitarist, a genius songwriter rythym guitarist, and the Duff + Steven rythym section had the best swing in hard rock. Not to mention their debut album is the best debut album ever put out. 

Why should I gtfo? Because I happen to love the original incarnation of a unique, amazing band? Telling me to “gtfo” over that is pretty toxic and immature of you, way to make antifa seem like a supportive group that people should want to join. 

Edit: Just checked your profile, you watch WWE. That really kinda confirms your total lack of intelligence."
5073,dyx61b,Because it’s irrelevant to the conversation
5074,dyx61b,No it was because it had no relevance to the conversation
5075,dyx61b,"Tell me about it. All I said was that I don’t care for them, I didn’t even say anything about how zach de la rocha’s singing sounds like a tween throwing a tantrum cause mom found his weed, or how tom morello’s guitar tone sucks"

5081,dyx61b,"It's an anti-Black Lives Matter thing. Black and white American flag with the center stripe being blue. It gives them the deniability of saying ""I just support the police, Blue Lives Matter!"" while in fact saying ""fuck black people I hope the cops kill them all"""

5091,dyx61b,"Oh yeah, checked that out a while ago, what a sad bunch of people those fascists are. Don’t forget bad religions age of unreason album comments and rise against’s wolves album comments. It’s like they’re just finding out now that punk isn’t for racist trash"
5092,dyx61b,"Not at all, the hypocrisy is in their music and the messaging. 

My point was simply, don’t put faith in any person or group who want to sell you something that tells you how to act and why. Think for yourself. 

If you can’t see how silly it is that 50 yr old men are still singing their 25 yr old anti-establishment songs to kids today for $200 a ticket even though they are not even remotely close to the band they were when when those songs were written and tickets were $15 you are their perfect fan. They are the establishment, “Give us your money and think what we tell you to think.” Is there anything more establishment than that?"
5093,dyx61b,"Ok, but what about his interviews with Bernie and Yang? Isn't he then also a gateway to leftist content too?"

5096,dyx61b,You could make the same intelligence quip about someone who frequents /r/unpopularopinion though.
5097,dyx61b,Is this copypasta? This feels like a bit. Thinking Led Zeppelin and GNR are the best is such boomer mindset shit. They Actually Suck.
5098,dyx61b,"GNR is literally the most toxic and immature band there ever was, that I can think of. They showed up and made a good record, then have been awful to fans, promoters, and each other since.

As a bass player, I like Duff. Slash was a legendary guitarist.

But they did nothing to earn any of this defense from you or their other fans I've seen put them in the highest echelons of rock music. To call a one album wonder second to LZ is fucking insane.

And I do watch pro wrestling, which between the pyro, silly outfits and often inane actions by their stars sounds right up a GNR fan's alley."

Regular listeners are being exposed to far, far more right-wing than left-wing ideas."
5126,dyx61b,"It's also the effect watching joe rogan has on your YouTube recommendations. Since a lot of people that watch Jordan Peterson or Dave Rubin or other alt lite channels also watch joe rogan, you'll get them ad recommended to you.

As for everything you said: Yeah, they probably are/were immature and assholes. Most people in rock bands are. That has nothing to do with the quality of their music, which is what I was talking about. Calling Appetite a “good” album is like calling the Mona Lisa a “good” painting. I agree, Duff is cool. Guitarist here, Slash is a big part of why I started playing. Honestly, the Use Your Illusion albums were pretty great too, so I wouldn’t really call them a one album wonder. Even if they were, when your album is that good, you kinda deserve to be praised as one of the best bands ever. Lastly, I’d equate pro wrestling to being a Kiss fan more than any other band (and if we’re touching on Kiss, I love Ace Frehley’s playing, but I could care less about the rest of the band)."

5131,dyx61b,Why are they interjecting a negative opinion anyway?
5132,dyx61b,"Saying “look at me, I’m special, I don’t like this band” is irrelevant when we’re discussing the post above"

5152,dyx61b,I think someone giving their opinion on the music of the band that is the topic of discussion is perfectly reasonable. I just think no one here likes their opinion
5153,dyx61b,And it hasn’t been mainly used like that ever.
5154,dyx61b,"Let's be honest here: the downvote button is rarely used that way, here or in other subs. Instead it's typically used for when someone expresses something which goes against the majority opinion, which is exactly what has happened here."
5155,dyx61b,Not really votes are a way of giving your opinion on something instead of saying “this”. For example if I said something racist in a post about racism it would be relevant but it would be downvoted because people disagree with me
5156,dyx61b,"Lol, another person got upvoted in this same thread for saying the exact same thing.

The hivemind here is pretty wild. Sean Kealiher would have had a lot to say about this."
5157,dyx61b,"Or just always have, ""Nazi Propaganda got covered here"" or some other Antifa or FC St. Pauli sticker with you, so you don't have to peel and can just quickly slap something ontop of the Nazi sticker.

5163,dyx61b,"I mean I literally just searched for a few of the big names in online far-right and far-right-adjacent spaces that popped into my head. If you have any actual data on the political leanings of guests on his show, I'd love to see it.

I also didn't claim that Rogan was a ""huge right-winger"" or making a conscious effort to indoctrinate his listeners - he was fairly open to Bernie Sanders, for example. It is, however, interesting that his political guests do seem to lean right more than they lean left, and that he has several right-wing guests on multiple times. 

It's hard to categorize the Joe Rogan Experience as a gateway to leftist content, not by any reasonable standard."
5164,dyx61b,"You apparantly don't understand how YouTube works. What topics he cover isn't important, the actual content isn't important for the way recommendations work.

Because you know what, propaganda actually works."

But just because you don’t like it doesnt mean it’s not a fantastic album, because it really is by every measure."

Pick a random podcast and give it a listen... all he does is ask people questions and let them speak their piece. Are you really that afraid of Stephen Crowder? He made a fool of himself when Joe had him on!

He's also had a bunch of environmentalists on like Joe Salatin. He's had Paul Stamets twice. He's had Graham Hancock on a few times. How about that Elon Musk interview? The sheer number of hours that he has done on other topics far overshadows the amount of right wing content available."
5176,dyx61b,If you don't know then why did you say that listeners are exposed to more right wing than left wing ideas?
5177,dyx61b,"Joe Rogan listeners watch all the other topics that I named. Get a clue before you speak on topics you have no idea about. And get out of here with all that ""think of the children!"" pearl clutching nonsense. Kids are far more likely to fall prey to their own parents political propaganda than some random youtube videos."
5178,dyx61b,"> Appetite for destruction is an amazing album ... That’s just a plain old fact. 

I'm not trying to be an asshole, and I might be one accidentally here, but I think you're confused about what a ""fact"" is. As a fan of metal for the last 30 years--and someone that grew up in the GNR era--I am impressed by their musicianship, but because it's hard rock and not one of my preferred genres I just can't agree with your assertion of their greatness irrespective of personal tastes.

I respect your enthusiasm for their work. Keep on preaching the good word of GNR."

The country is already becoming fascist and not voting helps that, American Capitalism is totally fucked but it is so much less fucked than fascism. If he is re-elected many of us will be in camps within a month. We need to make him lose by a landslide and then be ready to fight if that doesn’t work. But voting is the best way to save the most lives. Sometimes the lesser of two evils is substantially less evil, this is one of those times. There won’t be a revolution, there will be no change at all, if he is re-elected, just lots of death and internment. They have already said they will come after us and it’s reasonable to think they have already put our names on lists (they have the technology of the NSA at their fingertips, we literally do not stand a chance against that. That’s just being realistic). He needs to lose in the popular vote so that we are on the side of righteousness to all the voters. If he wins the popular vote than any action will be seen as trying to subvert the will of the people and will be met with just resistance by the populace. If we don’t have popular support then we are no better than anyone else trying to maintain power without popular support, we would in effect be against the people and undeserving of our non-consensual power.)

Vote against fascism and be ready to fight afterwords."

The nationalist element is core to fascism as it sees the nation as the key societal element and the strenghth of that nation is paramount to the exclusion of virtually all else. To further this fascism always paints ""its group"" as the hard done by victim and ties up an individuals self esteem into the greater glory and achievments of the group. This links back into the corporatist economic ideas of fascism.

Fascism is not just ""being nasty to people you don't agree with"" or ""violence"" as the state has the authority of violence yet we do not call it fascist."

Some of their better ones like Einstein had to flee and regroup elsewhere for obvious reasons. 

A lot of respectable intellectuals are neo-Nazis. Don’t be fooled by average ding dong traffic cops that go around harassing minorities and clonking BLM protesters over the head with batons. These are indeed impulsive, aggressive violent morons who couldn’t make the cut for leadership or detective roles. 

What one should remember is that fascism, per Mussolini and other notables like Orwell, is an ambiguous idea. It is inherently neatly sewn in with malicious, predatory and sadistic inclinations woven into the dna of a whole lot of us by evolution. That is why tens of millions of people don’t see anything wrong at all with kneeling on someone’s neck until they inevitably and quite unsurprisingly asphyxiate and die."

5252,j9uuyl,"That’s not the will of the people though, that’s just the will of some people in control forcing their will on everyone else. Most Americans don’t want more trump or his fascism. Don’t forget that it’s the silent majority and the vocal minority. The loud people are not the bulk of the people, though it can be hard to remember that if you are in one of the parts of the country that has his back. But those aren’t most the country. The first step though, regardless, is voting against him. Even if it’s just for optics he needs to lose in a landslide, and everyone needs to see that, that’s why it’s important that we all vote even though it is absolutely voting for the (substantially) lesser of two evils. The only way to truly fight him and his manipulation of the media is through a landslide vote. That is the only way we start with the upper hand, otherwise we look like the losers right from the beginning.

Bite your lip if you gotta when you vote but trump needs to lose by a landslide and this is too much of a dangerous time for idealism. If he wins the popular vote then the US is officially a fascist state and our fight becomes next to impossible as most people will interpret it as the will of the people supporting fascism, regardless of if there is any truth to it. And he will use it as justification for any steps he chooses to take, no matter how unconstitutional they are or how many people they hurt.

Also, on another note, it’s a vote to get people out of cages and that’s something we should all be in support of. We should be voting for the victims and the people that will become victims if he is re-elected."
5253,j9uuyl,I didn't even read your comment lmao
5254,j9uuyl,Happy cake day
5255,j9uuyl,[removed]
5256,j9uuyl,"You're absolutely right and it's chilling, but yes i was more referring to the average trump supporter, rather than the smart yet unambiguously evil people leading them"
5257,j9uuyl,This.
5258,j9uuyl,"While it's always good to remember they also have some intellectuals among their ranks, highlighting them among the masses of violent idiots look like survival bias."
5259,j9uuyl,They think they'll be safe as part of the in-crowd.
5260,j9uuyl,"It’s a good thing no one said that then. I didn’t say anything about it helping people, also my point was that it’s *not* satire. Without going into a long explanation, it’s not satire because satire forms jokes differently, satire is only funny when you know it’s satire, Babylon Bee is only funny when you think it’s real (and even then enraging is the feeling they are going for, not funny so much),  it loses it’s entertainment value if the reader realizes it’s not real. Satire does not work that way, satire is not funny unless you know it’s not real, knowing that it isn’t real is a necessary part of the joke, that’s a requirement for something to be satire. If it’s funny when you think it’s real then it’s not satire, it failed as satire. But then it’s fantastic propaganda and the perfect way to tell lies about your opponent without repercussions."
5261,j9uuyl,Wow. I just got stupider reading the comments there
5262,j9uuyl,"Very fair. I just had to wonder if democracy was necessarily the end-all be-all. People, after all, can be wrong in unison."
5263,j9uuyl,"I mean, you're not wrong.  It was late and I was typing on my phone.  Lol."
5264,j9uuyl,Lmao you're really dumb aren't you ?
5265,j9uuyl,Ah to be so simple minded
5266,j9uuyl,Post hog
5267,j9uuyl,**False equivalence is a logical fallacy in which an equivalence is drawn between two subjects based on flawed or false reasoning. This fallacy is categorized as a fallacy of inconsistency.**
5268,j9uuyl,It's the worst combination...
5269,j9uuyl,This is how so many fascist regimes did it.
5270,j9uuyl,"Look, my momma's my sister and I got a grandpa-daddy who learned me some things. That New York City billionaire with all the corruption scandals who hates dogs loves people like me and will protect me from the swamp of coastal elites. Them same capitalists that poisoned the water and land in my town and then never cleaned it up so my 15 kids has got cancer, them same ones that treat me like cattle at work and don't pay me enough to live with dignity, they're also on my side because they know I'm white. I got special blood like the Hapsburgs and the capitalists will treat me good if I'm a completely loyal rugged individual."
5271,j9uuyl,"I think, that if we examine all the ways that our government is deeply undemocratic, that we cannot assume that the status quo is actually what the majority of people want."
5272,j9uuyl,(it’s a troll)
5273,j9uuyl,Very fair. I may have gotten tossed aside into an altogether different point. Apologies on that.
5274,j9uuyl,They're commenting in conservative I doubt it is
5275,hikt41,That magnificent bastard is giving us free advertising 😎
5276,hikt41,"Hey guys, y’all want to oppose fascists together later if you’re not doing anything?"
5277,hikt41,Why did reddit ban /r/nazi and not /r/antinazi \- a massive subreddit devoted to banning nazis?
5278,hikt41,Hey wait a minute! Have you guys been organizing illegal antifa terrorism without me?!
5279,hikt41,"Without even reading the actual thread, I can already tell his followers responses will be something along the lines of how Democrats and the MSM want to silence them and their “truths” and how they’re openly being “attacked” for people telling them to stop spreading their hate speech."
5280,hikt41,It shouldn't surprise anyone that those who cannot comprehend anti-fascism as a philosophy do things like this. It's merely an appeal to the echo chamber; wanting to hear agreement so it's not so hard to keep carrying that cognitive dissonance.
5281,hikt41,"Who wants to bet he's never been on Reddit, yet alone r/T_D or r/antifascistsofreddit"
5282,hikt41,"The media is INCREDIBLY good at hiding antifa violence. You never see it anywhere for how prevalent it is!!

/s"
5283,hikt41,"Organizing to protect the innocent is 'terrorism' to Trump's fascist cult of cruelty.

This house we call the USA is not in order. 

Don't hate, because the end-game is redemption. 

Tell right-wingers that there is no logic that commands we do not treat all innocents as our own. Tell them that we believe in love, and that's why we'll win.

The poor suckers think they can make love illegal."
5284,hikt41,"Specifically to make you mad, Charlie."
5285,hikt41,the fuck? We're anti-fascists. We are against evil. What's the problem with these people??
5286,hikt41,"You couldn't make up that these Nazis are so stupid that their attempt to hide what they're up to literally consists of ""anti-fascists are terrorists."""
5287,hikt41,"Well, Charlie, we so enjoy it, that we load up buses to go into small towns and fight the Hells Angels. You just don't see it because we're invisible."
5288,hikt41,When will they stop pretending that Antifa are fascists
5289,hikt41,It's ok reddit banned r/antifa😎 we got em boys antifa is no more😎
5290,hikt41,Because preventing murder is the same as murder.
5291,hikt41,He actually knows about reddit? Please tell me he also knows about r/toiletpaperusa
5292,hikt41,Honestly? Theres way more organizing in Twitter or Facebook than there is on reddit.
5293,hikt41,This emoji is always a bad sign. It’s like they think but really they don’t.
5294,hikt41,Does he believe the thinking emoji makes him look smart or something?
5295,hikt41,Umm actually r/theDonald is a top tier Childish Gambino fan sub.
5296,hikt41,They will never stop. Antifa has always been a wonderful target for their whataboutism.
5297,hikt41,"""Guys, we called it terrorism, it's terrorism now try to keep up."""
5298,hikt41,Wait till he hears of Indymedia lol
5299,hikt41,They killed Chapo exactly so he wouldn’t say rhat
5300,hikt41,"And yet reddit DID ban /r/ChapoTrapHouse for...cheering on the [attack on Harper's Ferry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown%27s_raid_on_Harpers_Ferry)

Because apparently making fun of racists and slave owners is bad now"
5301,hikt41,Sooo he’s never actually been on here then. What a dense motherfucker
5302,hikt41,Is there ever any organizing going on here? I can't think of the last time i saw any
5303,hikt41,">Why did Reddit ban r/theDonald but not r/AntifascistsofReddit a massive subreddit devoted to organizing illegal ANTIFA terrorism?

Because ANTIFA is not a terrorist organization, your alt-right organizations ARE, [according to the fuckin' FBI!](https://www.fbi.gov/cve508/teen-website/what-are-known-violent-extremist-groups)"
5304,hikt41,Literally the worst thing I’ve seen here is a plan to flood I think 4chan with gay porn.
5305,hikt41,A lied told often enough becomes truth
5306,hikt41,Charlie? Is that you?
5307,hikt41,When it stops working.
5308,hikt41,"They won't. These people are either fascists or duped by fascists, and as long as that remains the case antifa as a movement will be demonized - because a world where resistance against fascist regimes is illegal is exactly what they want."
5309,hikt41,"The act like ANTIFA is a company. It’s not. It’s an ideology, there is no gay inc., same as there is not ANTIFA inc."
5310,hikt41,"Wait, Antifa is legal?

Ok, folks, i'm out. This became boring!

/s"
5311,hikt41,"Hey Charlie, fuck off. You're gonna have to die mad about it"
5312,hikt41,Lmfao why would they direct attention here and have people see the alt right media has been lying to them about antifa the entire time?
5313,hikt41,They're calling protesting terrorism? lol
5314,hikt41,i came here after the raid of r/thechurchofpeanut. fascism sucks.
5315,hikt41,"When the audience stops blindly accepting whatever they’re fed.

Putin playbook again, for the eleventh million time.

Flip over whatever you’re accused of, toss it the other way and create a false equivalence + deflection."
5316,hikt41,This is the hilarious part of Reddit banning places like CTH in an effort to appeal to both-sidesism: Conservatives will always find something to complain about.
5317,hikt41,"Charlie Kirk is a fascist sympathizer. Chuck, if you are reading this, fuck you"
5318,hikt41,Charlie Cuck is sad his Nazi message board is gone. What a loser.
5319,hikt41,"Fascists like Kirk always blame the other side when they get caught. r/TheDonald was banned for inciting terrorism, so naturally his lying Nazi ass says the \*other\* side did it. Hitler, Mussolini, and Steve Bannon would be proud."
5320,hikt41,It's because the CEO of Antifa pays money to Reddit to keep us open. All praise to the CEO of Antifa!
5321,hikt41,"Does anyone know what the actual legal standing of the ""antifa is a terrorist organization"" is? Did that actually go anywhere, or was it just the babbling musings of the president?"
5322,hikt41,"To be fair, 'antifa' being illegal in a quasi-fascist state makes perfect sense"
5323,hikt41,AnTiFa TeRrOrIsM
5324,hikt41,Why do these folks always capitalize the whole thing like its some sort of acronym?
5325,hikt41,What should I spend my Soros check on?
5326,hikt41,You can tell Charlie is just an outrage jester because he forgot the underline in T_D's name.
5327,hikt41,r/thedonald is a sub devoted to Donald Glover which is still up. I have no idea what sub he's talking about.
5328,hikt41,The “people who are against fascism are automatically all terrorists” position makes it pretty clear the person saying it is a fascist. I’m not sure they’re smart enough to understand this.
5329,hikt41,"I found this sub because of that tweet. Good work, Kirk! You’re advertising for the good guys."
5330,hikt41,Hey guys what terrorist activity have you got planned? I'm personally planning to go strike fear in my ends by putting up some stickers. Dont forget your soros bucks and to centralise command!
5331,hikt41,Charlie Kirk is malding
5332,hikt41,"Also like, I don’t see anyone using this an organizing hub... more like meme share zone. I fucking love ol’ Charlie tinyface Kirk"
5333,hikt41,When we force the open fascists back underground for another three decades.
5334,hikt41,jesus why don't they ban charlie kirk goddamnit
5335,hikt41,"Oh yeah I forgot the president declared us a terrorist organization, lol."
5336,hikt41,"I mean I got called terrorist before because of my religion, nothing new."
5337,hikt41,"This is your brain on fox. 

Any questions?"
5338,hikt41,Made a twitter account just to respond to him.
5339,hikt41,Who is Charlie Kirk? 🤔
5340,hikt41,Didn't they ban r/Antifa?
5341,hikt41,Antiantifa are the real terrorists!
5342,hikt41,the real illegal organizing goes on /r/antifascistsofreddit2
5343,hikt41,Hi Charlie!  Glad to know you're watching!
5344,hikt41,"This goof just knows none of his followers will even bother to look at this subreddit and see what it's all about.  If they did, they'd just see a bunch of decent folks standing up against fascism, oppression and racism."
5345,hikt41,"Anyway, does anyone know when's the next terrorism planned? I skipped the last meeting."
5346,hikt41,"The failure of these idiots to realize that ANTIFA stands for anti-fascism, along with the fact that ANTIFA isn't even an organized group, but the concept of standing against fascism, continues to always bring me pleasure. 

I'll just be over here suckling upon the sweet salty tears of the alt right."
5347,hikt41,They’re just going to keep calling an imaginary group terrorists until it becomes a “group”
5348,hikt41,"When?

When they find a new boogeyman to fear that matches up with their fears of the month.  Right now Antifa is even better than Muslim because ""it can be anybody, even your white straight neighbor."""
5349,hikt41,"Antifascists terrorize fascists. if you think antifa is a terrorist organization, youre a fascist."
5350,hikt41,They'll stop when every single one of us is in a concentration camp.
5351,hikt41,"Haha I wish this sub was about organising ANTIFA ~~""terrorism""~~ action! But that's against reddit guidelines, and we, unlike TheDonald, manages to stay within guidelines, and just celebrates action that has already been taken."
5352,hikt41,"Why did he phrase this tweet in the perfect format for r/toiletpaperusa? 

#Since he’s seen reddit you’d think it would get through to him."
5353,hikt41,"Wait, ANTIFA stands for Anti-Fascist?!?"
5354,hikt41,When they stop being morally bankrupt dishonest shit bags?
5355,hikt41,"[r/conservative](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&vidve=5727&autoplay=1) should be next

don’t click that link bois, I warned ya."
5356,hikt41,“Nazis bad” is one American tradition I’m proud to carry on.
5357,hikt41,"One is racist trash the other is a place for angry people ready for a fight against fascism to congregate. One of these is on a much higher morality scale, which is something people like him don't understand."
5358,hikt41,I imagine theyll stop acting like it's illegal when the right pushes enough politicians into the right places to make it actually illegal.
5359,hikt41,"As an unstructured non-organization Antifa itself can’t really be illegal, but most of their direct action tactics definitely are."
5360,hikt41,"I like to put my ILLEGAL ANTIFA TERRORISM in neat rows, ordered alphabetically, and in cute little containers so that they spark joy."
5361,hikt41,"they literally banned r/ChapoTrapHouse as well. If you want to play the other leftist subs card, then you better hold explicitly bigoted subs like r/LGBDropTheT to the same standard."
5362,hikt41,"If antifa was terrorism then the United States government is the most wanted terrorist organization on earth as they overthrown 50+ governments, who were democratically voted in, by staging coups across the world and assassination of world leaders who disagreed with their capitalism notably comrade fidel Castro who had many assassination attempts on his life by the US and they dare call us terrorist when we want equality among everyone and not just the bourgeoisie"
5363,hikt41,"Wait people are organizing illegal terrorism on here???

Oh shit I must've missed that will someone fill me in?
(Jkjk I wouldn't leave the house for anything.)"
5364,hikt41,[removed]
5365,hikt41,"When ANTIFA actually becomes illegal, I suppose"
5366,hikt41,[deleted]
5367,hikt41,Djeeee I wonder why
5368,hikt41,"I don't doubt Reddit. If it comes to it (or even if it don't, Reddit is trash anyway) use Raddle.me"
5369,hikt41,Low key wish they didn’t ban them because now they’re infecting other subs
5370,hikt41,"Wow, this completely changes everything, Kirk. Guess I'll just ban myself since I'm apparently a terrorist."
5371,hikt41,God I hate the 🤔 emoji. It's used exclusively by wankers asking bad faith questions
5372,hikt41,Or as if antfia is a like legit group with a organized leadership and roles. At this day and age it is a ideal.
5373,hikt41,This potato head mfer is so annoying
5374,hikt41,I mean CTH gone too so we’re even
5375,hikt41,Calling yourself ‘anti-fascist’ in a democracy is like yelling your ’anti-vegan’ in a McDonald’s. Nobody cares.
5376,hikt41,When will they stop pretending that AntiFa is an organization?
5377,hikt41,When are we gonna start organizing activities???!?!
5378,hikt41,"Oh I’m sure glad they didn’t ban this subreddit, this is the perfect time to organize some more illegal antifa terrorism!"
5379,hikt41,it's just as illegal as having a smushy fucked looking face like charlie kirk.
5380,hikt41,Come on guys really when do we start organizing the terrorism sheesh
5381,hikt41,Is this shit serious?
5382,hikt41,You guys been doing illegal terrorism? Smh.
5383,hikt41,Damn I guess the allies were doin illegal antifa action during ww2
5384,hikt41,He's such a shit brick
5385,hikt41,"When will they stop pretending that Trump is a Republican?

When will they stop pretending that Trump is a Christian?

When will they stop pretending that Trump is sane?

When will they stop pretending that Trump is a ""real"" man?

When will they stop pretending that Trump is rich?"
5386,hikt41,Massive? I’ll take it as a compliment.
5387,hikt41,I dont think I've ever seen anyone here organize anything lol.
5388,hikt41,And yet r/chapotraphouse is gone.  I'm now homeless.
5389,hikt41,"Because they were targeting leftist subs and this one is just a bunch of libs. Libs who are trying I guess though, so there's that."
5390,hikt41,"The_Donald was already quarantined due to probably violence, threats, and racism. r/trump is still doing fine. reddit isn’t trying to censor trump. The_Donald just happened to be doing rule breaking shit that any other subreddit would be banned for."
5391,hikt41,Organizing? All we do is orange man bad.
5392,hikt41,"Funny how the rude people are getting banned but not the polite people?

Neener neener, there’s a bias against rude people so therefore this justifies my rudeness."
5393,hikt41,Would love for him to bring out the body count
5394,hikt41,Recruitment drive? Recruitment drive.
5395,hikt41,When you prove you are not illegal and violent.  Which you have failed to do.
5396,hikt41,"Guys, I'm trying to join Antifa, but I can't find the recruitment office."
5397,hikt41,It’s only a matter of time before they come for the Left. Just wait and see. This subreddit will be banned eventually. Censorship always eventually hurts the ones that support it. Centrism is what they want. Pretty soon everything will be censored except establishment ideals. We’re on a slippery slope my friends.
5398,hikt41,Charlie Kirk isn't pretending. He's ACTUALLY retarded.
5399,hikt41,maybe because its literally breaking a US law of conspiring against the government?
5400,hikt41,[removed]
5401,hikt41,"Probably before it was banned in Germany that has experience with fascism and extreme violence, and the US started discussing labeling it a terrorist organization. Or maybe before the cell that tried to incite stabbings at the University of Utah was exposed and arrested but idk."
5402,hikt41,Hell yes. Lets organize tons of illegal acitivty!
5403,hikt41,Just got my soros check in the mail. Let’s cause some mayhem!
5404,hikt41,Sorry I’ll be busy doing a terrorism.

5407,hikt41,I'll race you there!
5408,hikt41,I vote we start calling it oppofa.

5413,hikt41,"BE GAY, DO CRIME"
5414,hikt41,This comment right here officer.
5415,hikt41,WHY IS THERE SO MUCH HATE on BOTH SIDES??
5416,hikt41,"it must be banned this sub too [r/DeathtoAmeriKKKa/](https://reddit.com/r/DeathtoAmeriKKKa/)

I thought it was similar to this one, but it seems they are actual kkk trying to clean up their reputation.

Im trying to troll them."
5417,hikt41,I hate it when I get left out of the organization of illegal activities. That's why I signed up and pay my dues in the first place!
5418,hikt41,No I think you mean ANTIFA terrorism
5419,hikt41,Sorry you couldn't make it in time since you stayed at femboy hooters paying for our meetup
5420,hikt41,I know right ?! I'm still waiting to get my membership card in the mail !
5421,hikt41,"Nope, just First Amendment-protected anti-Nazi stuff. I happen to love free speech and expression and had family that fought in WWII who helped to defend liberty and justice and fight the tyranny of an authoritarian state. There’s really not much that’s more American than that, now that I think of it. 

Really makes you wonder why Mr. Kirk seems to hate American values so much🤔"
5422,hikt41,"But if we can't yell ""White Power"" out of our golf carts in Florida without social consequences, are we really free? 

\- Nazi."
5423,hikt41,"What's funny is the people who say ""antifa are the real fascists"". They clearly don't understand either ideologies and it simply makes no sense, nor is it true, while they're practically denying the existence of actual fascists just to make a narrative about anti-fascists. It's like a man in the 1960's saying ""ni##er-lovers are the real ni##ers""."
5424,hikt41,"instead of framing it as why a person does it, id rather think of what are the effects and what are the fluctuations of power caused by reinforcing the echo chamber/hegemony.

It doesnt surprise me to see it, it hurts me"
5425,hikt41,"Maybe he hasn't gone in those, but I doubt he managed to avoid the powerful influence that r/ToiletPaperUSA memes have on his face."

5429,hikt41,"We are against them, that's their problem with us."
5430,hikt41,"Oh cool now being a fascist is evil, wow /s

/uj I unironically heard people say this"
5431,hikt41,"It's kind of telling where their mental state is at.  I mean, they never got passed the ""I know you are but what am I?"" schoolyard jeer."
5432,hikt41,"I don't really care for superhero movies, but I'd watch one where a superhero group bought a VW bus, made it invisible, then went to political rallies to counter-protest radical racists *by any means necessary*.

I'm just imagining the X-Men roll up to some stupid right wing protest and Cyclops just starts laser blasting some Nazi assholes. He takes the glasses off and just does a sweep of the crowd, Confederate flags tear up and catch fire. There's a shot of a Nazi flag, then claws tear through it from behind as Wolverine busts through towards the camera. Fuck it, I think this is like superhero universe mixing or something, but Superman flies in and is like ""I fought you assholess in the 40's, and I'll do it again!"" Captain America shouts ""Bash the fash! There is no ethical consumption under capitalism!!!"" as he shield bashes fashs. Fuckin Hulk is roid raging against some Confederate statues, just one handing them and smashing them to the ground. He's all ""Hulk... hate... slaver fuckwits!""

Idk I think there's something in there."
5433,hikt41,Because that's what Fox News tells them to say.
5434,hikt41,"When they stop supporting fascism. In other words, never."
5435,hikt41,"oh yeah fascist dictatorship time

5436,hikt41,He does actually
5437,hikt41,"you probably didn't mean for it, but this is a hell of a roast lol"
5438,hikt41,Reddit would never ban the true Donald

5440,hikt41,our local indymedia got banned and shut down

5442,hikt41,"The dialog at CTH was threatening how the right interact with the left, and was changing the status quo for how leftist respond to troll fascists. Just makes me upset that CTH effectiveness is why it was quarantined and banned."

When people use the term snowflake just remember they're quoting Fight Club, a satire written by a gay man about how male fragility causes men to destroy themselves, resent society, and become radicalized, and that Tyler Durden isnt the hero but a personification of the main characters mental illness, and that his snowflake speech is a dig at how fascists use dehumanizing language to breed loyalty from insecure people. So, basically people who use snowflake as an insult are quoting a domestic terrorist who blows up skyscrapers because he's insecure about how good he is in bed.

IE: “if you do X, I am threatening you with [usually violence].” Don’t take sardonic, heated, bullying, taunting instructions as a real request. It’s the opposite. Here’s what you say: “am I being detained or am I free to go?” And if the answer is that you are being detained, you answer all questions with either silence or “I do not recall, may I speak with an attorney.” Walk away, and if you can’t walk away? Shut the fuck up, and obviously keep your hands to yourself. You are outnumbered by 3 big dudes with guns who are angry at you. Time to swallow your pride. I’m not talking about what the ethical and righteous thing to do in a just society is; I’m talking about how to not get killed by the pigs. Don’t be a fucking idiot. “But he shouldn’t have to deal with that!” Well this is the America we live in currently and the fact is that he does, and so do you. this is not a just society. Act accordingly. Preaching to the choir and getting fired up on the Internet isn’t going to help people getting assaulted and killed by cops right now in the street. You’re also not going to change systematic police brutality in the moment by standing up to a meathead with a complex and a firearm. Adapt to the situation. Survive. Don’t let a combination of your indignation and a cops arrogance be the reason for your death."
5697,dpyld1,Slapping an officer is still illegal with permission given that being said this is certainly entrapment and no harm was caused ( to the officer)
5698,dpyld1,"this sub is a cancer. if you really think its ok to break a law and slap a cop just because youre dared to youre a fucking idiot and deserve to rot in jail. instead of complaining about cOp BaD aNtIfA gOoD maybe you should sit down and consider why you shouldnt break the fucking law. the guy was in this scenario with a cop for a reason, and maybe if you cared to think about the backstory of why the cops were called then we could have a differwnt story

5710,dpyld1,"There really needs to be severe punishments for turning them off. The USA public, seemingly, have a very low level of support/trust towards their police force and it's only getting worse in the current climate. 

Having body cameras that are *always* on (apart from toilet breaks and such) and having steep fines when they're turned off (lost wages, demerits against promotions etc.), investigations into why they were off or even having cases and convictions thrown out seems to make a degree of sense to me."
5711,dpyld1,Pretty easy to understand. They have fingers. And noone is going to write them up for it.
5712,dpyld1,Because everyone in a position to hold them accountable relies on them for personal protection?
5713,dpyld1,"I think that body cams shouldn't be able to be turned off ever. Cops should have multiple body cams so if one dies they have a back up and if they dont use one, they should be very heavily penalized and possibly suspended/fired."
5714,dpyld1,Well I mean do you want a camera on your chest to be turned on when you are taking a piss or a shit? Like ya its bs they turn them off then do shit like this but they do have a reasonable right to privacy when using the restroom while on duty.
5715,dpyld1,Wouldn't a cop turning off their body cam cause one to fear for their life?
5716,dpyld1,I’ll never understand why cops
5717,dpyld1,You're joking right?
5718,dpyld1,"FYI. There are a lot of reasons when they would. In place where people have the expectation of privacy (bathrooms, locker rooms, etc.), sometimes when they talk to sex assault or domestic violence victims (often they won't say anything to a cop if a camera is on), they are off when not dealing with the public (eating, restroom, report writing, just driving around, etc.), during security post type gigs, some tactical situations where procedures have to be secret (swat stuff, hostage stuff, etc.). 

They are off most of an cops shift, remember they have limited storage and batteries, cops work between 8-16 hour shifts. In addition the videos have to be categorized, labeled, stored, etc.  A pretty high resolution video running for 8 hours would use a lot of storage space."

5720,dpyld1,"I will never have an interaction with a police officer again without my phone camera rolling. One time a cop pulled me over, found a reason to arrest me, and handcuffed me in the FRONT SEAT of his vehicle. Yes I’m a female who was in her mid-20’s then. Had my boyfriend who had been in another car not walked over to find out wtf was going on I have no doubt I would have been raped by a state trooper."
5721,dpyld1,You can see the guy and the tough spot he knows he's in. He's surrounded by 3 hyper aggressive dudes who won't let him leave. One of them is yelling a command at him but he knows it's a trap. He looks at one of the other officers for guidance but they provide zero help. So he tries to follow the command in the safest way possible but it was still a trap all along

5723,dpyld1,Do people actually think ALL cops are bad? Even thoughs that stand up to corruption and testify against other cops?
5724,dpyld1,Yep. Onetime cops broke in my house for a wellness check for one of my roommates in college. He smelled weed and wouldn’t allow me to call my lawyer. He actually took the phone from my hands. He promised me if I gave him the weed he wouldnt arrest me. It was like shake in the bottom of the bag (I actually was about to buy more weed). He then spent ten minutes basically threatening me that if I didn’t give him the weed that he knew I had he would search the house and arrest me for anything he found and claim it was paraphernalia and that I was resisting arrest and lying to an officer. He then immediately arrested me and told me he never said any of that lol. I always regret not recording that.

I don't have all the answers to those concerns, but really we're talking about *literally* people's lives here. I don't believe all police officers are bad but it'd be a lie to claim there aren't bad apples in the police forces. 

So, while there are corrupt police willing to abuse their, frankly incredibly powerful, position to torment, assault and even murder civilians with impunity I don't think issues such as storage are too large to overcome from a technical standpoint.

Or, if I'm totally wrong, there needs to be a way of keeping these people totally accountable in other ways that I don't know off the top of my head because there are *far* too many cases of them abusing their positions, and getting away with it to boot.

I understand police corruption is a huge and complex issue but that's not enough of a reason to shy away and to continue the way things are going.

5868,dpyld1,"You can automate most of that, and handling video in cloud storage is a very old, very solved problem.

At this point, not having them is very much indicative of criminal activity i.e. ""Something to hide"""
5869,dpyld1,"Just because it records an 8 hour shift doesn't mean they have to store it. They could easily have a person whose job it is to cut out anything between calls, and only store the video of when something is going on. They don't need to check for gaps unless gaps are turning up, like a cop is putting in an incident report but doesn't have the video to go along with it. Then in that case they could look into that officers video with a higher standard."
5870,dpyld1,"You don’t need to watch the video to see if there are gaps. There are options. First, the camera can be manufactured so that it can’t be turned off by the officer. It could also be programmed to create an event in the log every time it’s removed or turned off which. The event log can be monitored with simple rules to raise a flag, which can be investigated. You wouldn’t want cops reviewing the logs or recordings, it would have to be an independent third party. Storage would be expensive, but not undoable. Ultimately, cops are people with an obscene amount of power and need to be held accountable for how it’s used. If a cop turns off their camera, anything that happens during that time should count against the cop. Suspect gets shot with the camera off, that’s a 1st degree murder charge. Complaint against a cop for beating a young person and the cameras off? Assault and battery against the cop. Cop conducts a traffic stop, but the cameras off, case dismissed. They’ve proven that they can’t be trusted. Either make them accountable, or get rid of them all together."

5873,dpyld1,"Yeah, the device has space. You were right, that was a weak argument.  But the retention of all that video is a real thing.  At about 3 GB an hour, 40 hours a week, 44 weeks a year = \~5 TB a year per officer.  Say 5 years, with a 100 officers = 2,500 TB for a small size department.  Storing that on the cloud or in a local server can be expensive. 

There is no ""keep video private"", there is freedom of information requests and so forth, also anything on that whole shift 8-hour video would be admissible in court.  That video would be given to all the prosecutors and defense layers for all the cases they did that day.

So if you were in a locker room for a gym and the cop is making a report because someone broke into a locker and they were dusting for fingerprints or some shit, you would be cool with them filming you?

Normally a pretty small percentage of a cops shift is going to be interacting with people. (5%-20% maybe?)

But I was just trying to share how it works for most departments.  I doubt any department has a ""always on"" policy."
5874,dpyld1,"There is no reason to put somebody who is arrested/detained in the front seat. The entire purpose of the back seat is for holding people.

5887,dpyld1,"Herd mentality is a real psychological phenomena. It’s why soldiers will ignore or even help others that are breaking the law even though they won’t do it themselves. Plus we don’t know if that cop was just being an asshole or if the citizen instigated the cop. 

That cop was definitely wrong either way, but I would be more understanding of his actions if he was provoked. And yeah yeah “cops are supposed to be above acting this way”, yet they are flawed people like everyone else. Let’s see you go to the inner city somewhere and provoke someone. I’d be willing to bet that you get punched. And if this cop wasn’t provoked, then I hope he rots in jail."
5888,dpyld1,"Yeah I feel those other cops were wrong. There is an explanation through, it’s called herd mentality and it occurs anytime humans group together. 

Take a look at Vietnam for example. Some US soldiers killed children while their battle buddy’s either assisted or turned a blind eye. While the child killers and the people that turned a blind eye are wrong, does this make all army soldiers bad or wrong?"

5895,dpyld1,"One of the reasons I get mad at all police officers is because in many cases the ""good police"" allow the bad police to do bad things. 

It is deeper than that however because it's not just the police it's that the entire justice system is corrupt. It makes slaves out of people for minor offenses and it is all for profit. 

When people say **all cops are bastards** is because you can't be a part of something so corrupt and then pretend like you apart from it at the same time. You can be a good person but you are still a part of a system that causes so much harm, and that makes you a bastard."

5901,dpyld1,Well then they're not a very good cop to begin with if they lack that integrity. Unfortunately the system can be corrupt as fuck and many officers who speak out against their coworkers lose their job. But that's an entirely different problem than just plainly say all cops are bad as many people are in this thread.
5902,dpyld1,What is to say that cops don't report this shit on a daily basis but the higher ups just keep it under wraps. What if they go to the press they would be out of the job? What then?

5905,dpyld1,They can turn it off on toilet breaks. But they should really force it to be a habit to turn it immediately back on after the toilet break.
5906,dpyld1,"FYI. There are a lot of reasons when they would. In place where people have the expectation of privacy (bathrooms, locker rooms, etc.), sometimes when they talk to sex assault or domestic violence victims (often they won't say anything to a cop if a camera is on), they are off when not dealing with the public (eating, restroom, report writing, just driving around, etc.), during security post type gigs, some tactical situations where procedures have to be secret (swat stuff, hostage stuff, etc.). 

They are off most of an cops shift, remember they have limited storage and batteries, cops work between 8-16 hour shifts. In addition the videos have to be categorized, labeled, stored, etc.  A pretty high resolution video running for 8 hours would use a lot of storage space."

5909,dpyld1,"Using the restroom, making a personal phone call on official break time. Just standard things like that make sense to me. I definitely wouldn’t want hours of footage of me wiping my ass on a server somewhere."
5910,dpyld1,"The only situation would be in public washrooms and other areas where privacy us a concern. But yeah cops should only be able to turn them off in these situations, and it would be obvious in the video if they were actually turning it off for these reasons or not."
5911,dpyld1,"Going to the toilet and possibly dealing with a victim of domestic abuse/sexual assault is all I can think of.

5914,dpyld1,"Police Unions have given cops so much power, if they shoot and kill someone, they don't have to give a statement for 24 hrs. They can also demand to see the evidence against them *before* they give a statement. It's a COMPLETELY different set of rules for them and are stacked in their favor.


Fuck police unions and this rediculousness. Hold cops and anyone else accountable who have the power to take a life. Why is that so difficult?! And yes, I know it's a dangerous job, blah blah blah."
5915,dpyld1,"Throw in an override for the public's safety as well, if a cops using that blind spot to abuse their power then all it takes to turn the camera back on is something as easy as shouting police brutality. 

Toss in some heavy fines and whatnot for anyone who abuses that override which can be easily verified via the recorded footage and you've got yourself a better system."
5916,dpyld1,"First of all 3gb is a high estimate. You could probably save an hour in less than a gig. And as for saving it, I doubt they would keep it after a period Of time.

As for the no keep video private thing, I honestly don't give two shitz about that. Being able to turn off the video camera whenever you please is an even bigger problem. If you have to go to the bathroom and the camera is still on then cover the f****** lens or take the camera off. But if you're out in the field you should never be able to turn off that camera. And if for some reason that camera does come off or go off when you're out in the field, liability should be assumed not disregarded. When you become an officer you're supposed to serve the community. It's a serious job and you *should* know exactly what you're signing up for when you take it."

Go ahead and touch someone with a gun because they taunted you into doing it and you have no sense of tone. Go ahead and follow every instruction you hear from them completely literally, without credence toward situation, anger, or propensity for violence of the person speaking to you. After all, getting potentially or *actually* murdered by the police is all worth it as long as they get indicted afterward and you get to prove a point about how much they suck... with your life. What a great way to go. Should work out fine for you.

You misunderstand me if you think I’m advocating for the cop being in the right. He’s an asshole, and he’s a bully, and he’s wrong. He should go to jail. Doesn’t change the fact that the idiot in the video could have avoided an ass beating if he had some common sense. And so could you!

At the end of the day, I just don’t want to see you (and other keyboard warriors like you on this sub) get hurt. There’s literally comments on this thread advocating showing up at the cops house to try to assault him, or trying to assault him in the moment. You guys really think highly of your combat skills if you think that strategy is going to play out for you. And you seem like you could use this advice if you think that this was a smart way to behave by the guy in a situation like this. It wasn’t. And unfortunately you can’t see my concern; you just see me siding with the cop because I’m pointing out a way the situation could have been avoided. Which is just hilarious to me. Let me tell ya. ACAB. 

(Not worth your life to prove it though)

PS: and just because I’ve already written an essay here, I’m going to point out that the reason most of you commenting here  don’t recognize or respect “see what happens” as a threat, is because it’s a phrase predominantly used by black people when they are getting ready for an altercation (in my vast personal experience) and the major demographic on this sub (and reddit in general) tends to be white males with an anti authority complex who have never really interacted with black people and are also entitled enough to think that they should be able to stand up to authority figures because they’ve been taught that they’re infallible and they’re exploiting some loophole about the literal words being spoken and not the 80% of communication that is non verbal. Especially since they probably can’t pick up on these cues in the first place because of their ignorance and privilege. It’s so annoying. Interpreting this scene by acting like the cops literal words were somehow legally binding or earnest in any way (even though I agree that they were abusive and wrong) just fucking smacks of ignorance and privilege. And if that’s how you’re gonna go around comporting yourself? Sure! I’ll bet you’ll get a few police officers suspended or fired from the force, but in exchange you’ll probably get your spine broken or choked to death or shot 15 times... and I just think that that exchange is FUCKING STUPID, regardless of who is morally correct here. If the (white) man in this video didn’t get killed or paralyzed by these goons, then he got off easy, as far as I’m concerned. We all know that if the races were reversed in this video, that man would be deceased. And that they probably wouldn’t have found the cop guilty. Protect your motherfucking neck."
5938,dpyld1,"lol i love when radicals cant find reasons to support them and just tell people to go fuck themselves or to fuck off. assault is a crime no matter what, thats why its a law. i should also clarify that i mean radicals on the right and left, because if i dont youll acuse me of being a nazi."

5946,dpyld1,Cops misbehave so often they must be on by default. They not have to be released to the public. But they must always be recording because putting the onus on cops to turn the body cams on just leaves them open to abuse.
5947,dpyld1,"Yeah I knew there would be reasons and also I'm aware I  don't know enough about situations. Realistically though that footage should always be completely secure from anyone unless for an investigation that's been approved.

Shouldn't be that private really, what are they going to be saying whilst working that needs privacy? I don't disagree with your comments just a thought."

5949,dpyld1,"Well with that logic, it shouldn't matter there's hundreds of hours wing your ass, no one should have access to that video.  The same should be true of all the recordings. It shouldn't be free for people to go look when they want.  

It should be secure enough for the other footage that this isn't a worry is my meaning."

Exactly this! If a truck driver or taxi driver speeds or otherwise breaks the law doing their job they are still held accountable, in my country to a higher degree (fewer points allowed before their license is revoked), but for police they're immune?

They should be examples of control and restraint using force *only* when needed. 

> And yes, I know it's a dangerous job, blah blah blah. 

Again, they go into the job knowing full well they'll be put into dangerous positions. If they can't control themselves and restrain themselves in dangerous positions they're either not capable of performing in their job or lack the adequate training in de-escalation.

5955,dpyld1,">First of all 3gb is a high estimate. You could probably save an hour in less than a gig.

Your thinking some sort of compressed video format or low quality.  Neither of which is practical in the field due to needing processing power which needs more battery.

Once back at the station compressing it probably has issues with being evidence.

200GB SD cards are cheap so an entire shift being recorded should not be a problem even at 3GB an hour.

Storage long term would also be an issue. Because it adds up fast storing huge amounts of uncompressed HD video.  But rules could be made about time stored uncompressed and toa if not involved in an incident/complaint.

There really does need to be times when the camera is off.  But there needs to be strict rules about failure to return it to service.

You're childish for asking a possible rape victim if they're hot and you should be ashamed of yourself. Or more accurately, your mother should be ashamed to have raised you."

I’m from the country so my example reflected my perspective. If you are comfortable in the city then go to the country and insult someone. Heck, go anywhere where people look different than yourself and insult someone, it’s very likely you will encounter people who punch you in the face.

5965,dpyld1,"Lol yes! I can finally die happy now that I have been called that newly made and already overused label boomer! I love it. 

Let’s break this down, shall we?

Wrong assumption 1: my words somehow indicated that I thought or believed the old man deserved it.

Ever heard of cause and effect? You know, it’s when something initially happens which then causes another thing to happen aka the effect. Since the beginning of this video has been omitted we don’t know the circumstances leading up to this situation. Even though **those cops are wrong** for what they did, it is a possibility that the old man provoked them. Saying that this situation may be the result of cause and effect does not mean he *deserved* what happened to him. That’s just totally bullshit fabrication on your end and only reveals your bias and agenda. 

Wrong assumption 2: that I am a sociopath.

First off, what’s a sociopath? Let’s see, a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience. Is it sociopathic for me to suggest that guy may have provoked those officers? Nope. Is it sociopathic to say “all cops are bad”? Fuck yeah it is, by definition. What about the behavior of twisting what people say and putting words in their mouth? Check. What about making wrong assumption after wrong assumption about someone that has a different perspective? Check. Psychology says we project ourselves at other people, so you calling me a sociopath means...? Check."

That’s the worst kind of suffering. Reversing years of human progress is not the answer. When a cop breaks the law then throw their ass in jail.

I’ve had plenty of on-duty cop experiences and almost every single time there was good cause to pull me over or investigate me. Sometimes I felt like the situation was bullshit, yet every time I was respectful and did what was needed to get through the situation with as little trouble for myself as possible. Most of them are just trying to do their job the best they can, considering **all** people *including them* are flawed."
5970,dpyld1,"**Some** cops lie to trick you into caged servitude. Fixed that for you. 

The role/position of cop isn’t the problem, the real problem is the humans in these roles/positions that break the law. All people are flawed, even the people in these roles.

5978,dpyld1,"Well ""often"" is debatable.  There are about \~750,000 cops in the country, we hear about someone messed up like this about once a day?  But in either case,

The problem is that you can't say ""no we can't give this out to the public."".  Then there is lots of little reasons, like if you have an 8 hour clip for their day, you have to give that whole video to everyone about every case they did for the day.

I think most departments will have the reasons it doesn't get turned on in the policy, so they should normally get in trouble for not turning it on.

But, of course this is all debatable.  I was just trying to share how it normally works."
5979,dpyld1,I think that all recordings should be publicly available.
5980,dpyld1,"Well cops hear a lot of personal stuff all the time.  The radio is constantly streaming names, SSNs, birth dates, addresses, phone numbers, of members of the public.  In addition to normal human stuff, they could be talking to their SO, or venting about a supervisor to a coworker.  But why does anyone need a video of him ordering and eating a big mac for lunch?  Storing, reviewing, labeling, etc. videos all costs money.  In addition you would never be able to really review videos to look for bad behavior.  Because you would have to sift through 7 hours of nothing, to find the 2 hours of interesting stuff.

A problem is they can't edit the videos, so if you have a 4-hour 1/2 shift video for a day that whole video goes to the lawyers of all the people in the video.

It is an interesting problem, a solution would be to use a program to review the videos, but now people wouldn't like that because of the facial recognition stuff.  But at least some progress is being made."

5999,dpyld1,I disagree entirely. However I'm European and believe the public should have complete rights to privacy and not have their recorded behaviour shown to anyone unless it's for a trial.
6000,dpyld1,There's no simple solution and nothing that would make everyone happy.
6001,dpyld1,"Couple of things:

1. Those cops are still viewed as being on duty regardless of whether or not they're just gossiping about what Betty was wearing the other day, taking a shit or eating a double baconator so why should the body can footage be viewed any differently, the entire point is to have a record of what the police are doing while on duty to verify details and ensure that these corrupt pigs aren't abusing their power.

2. Why is that a problem, it's just footage, pretty damn sure that a free copy of Sony Vegas will allow anyone with a couple of functioning brain cells to edit said footage into any and all pertinent data, an intentionally manufactured flaw in the system is not an excuse to continue abusing said system it's just another tacit implication of guilt."
6002,dpyld1,"I don't disagree, my opinion is based on the rights on people being recorded not the police though. I think the members of the public deserve privacy.   Obviously this is in contradiction to having the recordings public but you can't have everything in life."

give me video of old man attacking people and ill say he started it. everyone is recording it, surely there must be video evidence not just some pictures you try to spin context on.

till then you are wrong and backing out of the conversation.

6020,dpyld1,"Ah yes, there we go, the falsity is embraced and presented as fact and truth. At least you are honest about it."
6021,dpyld1,"Yeah, I’m sure. 

We have a difference of perspective. This means we see things differently. Just because someone thinks or sees differently from yourself doesn’t mean they need help or that it’s ok to label them. 

Incessant and impulsive labeling is a real problem with our species. Boomer one moment, sociopath the next, and now the added twist of victim complex. Have I labeled you? Well, I did say people who thought all cops were bad are sociopaths which is literally true. Then I joked about you being one, so I guess that may count. I will have to think about this. Maybe I’m in the wrong for joking about labeling you with the word you labeled me as. 

I like that you are no longer pursuing the anger bit. It’s totally fine to feel anger. The feeling exists for a reason. It has its benefits, like it it tells us about ourselves or that a situation is wrong. Can too much anger be bad? Sure, if it disrupts normal life or causes more problems than helps. What about having so much anger towards cops that it causes someone to act out against them thus gaining their attention and ire which feeds back into their bias and anger? In this case it’s advisable to seek help. 

Are there other times it’s advisable to seek help? Yawp, I believe there are.  Now this is just my opinion and may or may not be true, but I believe that the behavior of consistently making wrong assumptions is something that someone should seek help for. What’s an assumption? When someone fills in the blanks. Is what they choose to fill the blanks with correct? It can be and some can be better than this at others, but oftentimes what’s in the blank is based more on that persons bias/agenda/perspective than it is on the subject itself. What if what’s in the blank is wrong and they act on it? Boom, this is a root problem. People making false assumptions, believing the bullshit they just fabricated in their mind which is a totally lie most of the time, and then deciding to act on that lie. That means everything from that point on that is based on that wrong assumption is all wrong, all based on lies, all based on complete and utter fiction. Want some examples of this? How about that guy who mistakenly think someone stole their iPad and goes and beats them up? Of the guy who thinks someone is talking shit about them and starts shit just because they made a wrong assumption? And this guy is angry enough to murder? Real problems yo."
6022,dpyld1,"Wow, that question reveals more about *you* than it does me. 

The reason I’m here is because I peruse what’s on Reddit’s front page and comment using my **common sense**. I don’t give a fuck about “joining and surrounding myself with like-minded people for the sake of bashing others”. 

Like I told this others on this post, all people are flawed some more or less than others and this includes the people in the roles of cops. If those people fuck up and break the law then throw their asses in jail. There’s no need to label all cops as fascists, that only works to turn more people against antifa which has a real place being against neo-Nazis and their like."

Most recent thing I saw he said was that he is against thimerasol (a mercury-containing ingredient in a lot of vaccines) and not against vaccines in general.  He has a point; mercury should absolutely not be ingested intentionally.  But the amount is infinitesimal enough that the good outweighs the harm.

A lot of the problem lies in people with no frame of reference looking at things like EPA guidelines and using those numbers to say ""hey look, the EPA only says you can have 2ppb in drinking water but there's 50,000ppb in a flu shot!"".  Well yes, that's true, but 50,000ppb is so infinitesimally small that it is not going to do any harm in the body.  The EPA sets guidelines like this for drinking water contaminants because some of them, like Mercury, have an insanely long half-life within the body and therefore if there is a contaminant in the drinking water, it will build up over time to a point of potential toxicity.

I'm not going to cancel Jim Carrey because I disagree with one of his stances.  I enjoy him, his movies, and think he's been overall a positive force for good in the world.  He has one stance I don't agree with, but my whole family voted for Trump and I still love them anyway.  We're grown adults, and it's our responsibility to disseminate the information we receive and the opinions we hear.

Which sucked btw. Both parts of Germany failed this process. And its obvious why: Both were nation states with similar structures. Both needed personal to make those structures function. So both employed known nazis in some of these positions. Not something i would call proper denazification."

6167,ekikuk,"If you want to go with numbers and assumptions, I would bet there's more fascists in America than both Italy and Germany combined. Also that if the history of fascism, the term antifa, and how they play with current events were taught  in school here, it would   change  those numbers. 

People want to be good, and some embrace what they think is the right answer for what they are told are their problems. I don't say this as an excuse for them, rather a possible explanation. Of why people that are good at their core would follow a path of hate. It's that they are taught that there's just one way, and all others are attacking that one way. 

This is a problem when rational thought is viewed as an attack. And when so many lies are spun so tight around an idol they hold so dear. However it might not always be the best strategy to just jump down anyone's throat that embraces what threatens so many. Rather find something you can both identify with and build a bridge. I mean of course on individual levels, and in intimate settings. Not some nazi on the street. No punch that fucker. I'm talking about your coworker, and grandma."

6200,czegee,Racist sack of shit doesn't see the difference between a person with dark skin and an inanimate object. What a shock.

6207,czegee,I still fail to see how people are proud to fly the flag of a traitorous failed state. It's like flying the flag of Nazi Germany just because you have german heritage.
6208,czegee,"If I'm the brown person in question, this fucker better be armed."
6209,czegee,"It isn’t illegal to burn a Confederate flag where I live, and even if it was 🖕"

6217,czegee,Flag burning is protected by the Constitution under the freedom of speech they so love.
6218,czegee,"I get that burning the confederate flag would be illegal because it’s not yours (but you could 100% burn your own), but is it illegal to burn the American flag at all? Seems like a kinda stupid law"
6219,czegee,D*mb fuck
6220,czegee,OP is a scrubbed or bought sleeper account take a look for yourselves. Did Ru and Right wing trolls start this sub because they can’t find any actual Antifa members? Lots of upvotes for so few comments are we using upvote bots here too?
6221,czegee,He censors “d*mb fuck”.
6222,czegee,That's a r/rareinsults right there
6223,czegee,The problem is he *does* see a difference: he reveres the asspaper flag more that brown humans.
6224,czegee,I feel like they see both as property.
6225,czegee,"I mean, if it's not your flag it's arson.  It's one of those things that is illegal but not for the reason the assclown thinks."
6226,czegee,"right, but I assume that this person wouldn't be purchasing their own confederate flag to burn so it'd be vandalism. Cool and righteous vandalism"
6227,czegee,That’s what I was thinking?
6228,czegee,"Shit, burning the US flag isn't illegal, so burning the flag of a failed revolutionary state definitely isn't."

6235,czegee,There's a guy I see on campus all the time who flies the confederate flag next to an American flag on the back of his huge pickup. I just can't even fathom the logic behind that. It just makes them seem even more racist somehow. ^(also i cant stop thinking about what the drag of two full size flags does to his mpg)
6236,czegee,"It’s illegal to burn someone else’s American flag, for the same reason it is to burn someone else’s confederate flag, and legal to burn your own of both for the same reason."
6237,czegee,"No, in fact burning the flag is the preferred means of disposal."
6238,czegee,"I’ve just gotten lucky. I’m a leftist trans woman who lives in Austin, Texas. I don’t comment a bunch because I’m frankly new to reddit, and also bc I rarely have stuff to add.

Anyway, have a great day!"
6239,czegee,Also what does Ru mean?
6240,czegee,Quick!  Better defend the Confederate flag and confirm the racist stereotype in the same breath!  I am helping.
6241,czegee,"Exactly, it's not legal in the way they're addressing it"
6242,czegee,"Is it arson or just destruction of property and/or vandalism? I was given to believe arson requires a somewhat larger piece of property, like a vehicle or a building?"
6243,czegee,Wait it's not because the side that won the war want some random flag flown one time by its enemy to be venerated?
6244,czegee,"But it's made out like ""burning the Confederate flag is illegal"" not ""burning someone's Confederate flag is vandalism"" that's why I was confused"
6245,czegee,"I mean if the flag is someone elses property and you burn it, THAT is illegal. Its also good praxis tho, so..."
6246,czegee,"Im gonna do it. Im gonna say the b word.

#BRUH"
6247,czegee,"I am a true centrist. I pick out what I like from all across the political spectrum.

It's just that I really like what the left offers, and really dislike what the right offers."
6248,czegee,"People just can't understand this. I see so much ""Nazis are entitled to their own opinions"" bullshit every day it makes me sick. The entire world got together to kill Nazis because their ideology was so dangerous. 1/3 of all able bodied men died during that war. How are people okay with letting Nazis recruit people and spew their evil in the streets?"
6249,czegee,"Well I’m convinced/s

I’m a liberal and I’ve never heard another liberal refer to themselves as a “leftist” lol. This is a pretty obvious larp but whatever pays the bills comrade. Antifa doesn’t even exist other than in right wingers mind on Reddit so you guys had to make a sub I guess to perpetuate fear, I’m not surprised I’m actually more surprised someone didn’t think of it earlier because it’s kind of genius I must admit:)"
6250,czegee,RU is short for Russia but my phone autocorrected it to lowercase U sorry for any confusion.

Only downside is that we would look like idiots."

6253,czegee,"Well, fire is inherently more dangerous than, say, a knife, if the purpose is destroying a flag. Fire can spread uncontrollably."
6254,czegee,"Oh, my bad. You're right"
6255,czegee,no thats illegal you cant do that guys
6256,czegee,"What is ""center"" varies a lot with time in space. The only reasonable definition I can see would be that you like things as they are now. 

Picking things from both sides is not as easy as it sounds. The most common way people do it is to want lower taxes (right) and increased spending (left). It's obvious that this doesn't work. Expect to republicans, of course, because they still do it, with the only difference that spending is not for social programs but for military."
6257,czegee,"I would rather not get punched, thanks."
6258,czegee,"> So would we all be safe if we just wore clothes made out of confederate flags?

6357,hzc3o9,I don't know why this is so funny to me but it is.
6358,hzc3o9,"I know. Imagine looking around and saying, “yup. This is WAY better than it was 4 years ago. I’ll have more of the same please!” What level of cognitive dissonance does that require? Each successive year of the Trump regimes has felt like a slide into the plot of some apocalyptic horror movie: kids taken from their mothers and locked up in black site concentration camps, un-identified feds shooting protesters and kidnapping people off the street, mass unemployment and a LITERAL FUCKING PLAGUE killing us by the hundreds of thousands. Yup. America truly is “great”... 🤮"
6359,hzc3o9,"Here's the thing though. 

1. They think the protests and riots are paid for by <insert literally any Jewish billionaire>
2. They don't believe there's a pandemic
3. They don't understand economics and Trump keeps saying the economy is doing great. Any real economist that isn't a Capitalist shill is going to say otherwise, so they assume those economists are part of the secret group that wants to take down trump. ie. 'The Cabal' 'The New World Order' 'The Globalists'

To them, this IS America made great. Emboldened fascist militias, immigrant kids in concentration camps, Liberals and anti-fascists alike being thrown in unmarked vans by Federal Agents, the erosion of American Democracy at every level. This is what they wanted from the start. The people who didn't want this and didn't know it was coming stopped supporting him months or even years ago."

Adults in homes wield a lot of power, over bills getting paid, what groceries get shopped for, the thermostat, the breaker box, keys for the locks, air quality, modem access, and more if they are physically too big to handle ... and in conflict those can all be turned against occupants of the household.

I would suggest start with a well designed lock on your room, saving up what little you can with the intent of being able to make first and last month rent with deposit (fuck moving is expensive), get a hidden safe, keep toiletries out of common areas, packing an emergency go bag good for wilderness/street survival for at least 3 days (change of clothes, cordage, maps, water bottle, water filter, light tools, utensils & camp cup, etc), investing in rain gear, staying kind with real friends (the kind that will bail you out), getting reliable transportation (bike or car or truck, you know your local best) and paying attention to what makes a good roommate (which this step dad is definitely not being).

It can be very overwhelming, so tackle it in small bits, big problems are just a series of small ones, like one foot in front of the other can before you know it carry you kilometres away. Make it so the abusive home doesn’t hold you hostage with what you need in whatever small ways you can."
6374,hzc3o9,"Because Trumpers are fragile, petulant manlets that can't handle criticism or control their emotions?"

6376,hzc3o9,"If Biden wins, we'll have 4 years of little or no change, then a more competent fascist will replace Trump. Calling it now!"

6383,hzc3o9,Nope junior in highschool but nice try at insulting someone you have no idea anything about

Belgium is at the top with 859.91 deaths per million population.

USA is at the 8th place worldwide with 451.74 deaths per million population. But it also varies a lot per state. At the top is New Jersey with about 1780 deaths per million population, and Hawaii is at the bottom with about 20 deaths per million population.

6409,hzc3o9,Literally what I thought yesterday when I drove by a mf on a bike with the biggest trump flag I’ve ever seen on the back. I wonder sometimes what the Cheeto dick tastes like
6410,hzc3o9,"Not long ago it was trending on Twitter that the Trump campaign literally used a Nazi eagle on a shirt from his official store. 

Good times."
6411,hzc3o9,Yeah me too.
6412,hzc3o9,My favorite part is how all of the swag is manufactured in China and India and Mexico but they are all so emphatically in support of anti-immigration and anti-globalist policies.
6413,hzc3o9,Strongly agree and would like to reinforce this: how do you eat an elephant?  One bite at a time.
6414,hzc3o9,"Then it looks like we have our four years’ praxis laid out for us, eh comrade?"
6415,hzc3o9,"Yeah but itll be funny to watch Trumpers be mad he doesnt win. It would also be funny to watch libs mad Biden doesnt win. Win-win in some ways, but really it's a pretty big lose-lose"

6421,hzc3o9,Unfortunately I've experienced as many liberals that are too stupid to understand what antifa is. They're quickly becoming the modern centrist Democrats.
6422,hzc3o9,"""To get a rise out of people"" Yeah, right. This society will give bigots every single benefit of doubt before calling them what they are.

Its always ""He's probably just joking"", ""He was just angry"", ""He just wants a reaction"", ""She was on ambien"". None of that would make it any less bigoted."
6423,hzc3o9,I don't think they're intelligent enough to understand the meaning of the word.
6424,hzc3o9,"They don't, and that's the problem. They haven't realized racism isn't just about being a straight up white supremacist or nazi or whatever, it's the little daily prejudices we live our life by"
6425,hzc3o9,That's because most aren't. Most people in general aren't.

6427,hzc3o9,"yeah sure lemme just listen to a random person on reddit on who's never met my mom instead of my lifetime of experience to know that she's a racist piece of shit and act like she's a saint just because she crammed me out of her vagina a few decades ago, that makes sense"
6428,hzc3o9,I'm allowed to call my qanon mom that you silly robot
6429,hzc3o9,"Yup, no connections at all between anti-environmentalism and pandemic risks. Experts who've been talking about it for years must've just been hedging their anti-Trump bets."
6430,hzc3o9,"Yeah, I get why I got this. I used their words lol."
6431,hzc3o9,Portland is the dress rehearsal
6432,hzc3o9,I cited the total deaths because the comment I replied to referred to the “death toll” not deaths per capita.
6433,hzc3o9,It is more useful to go state by state with the usa as they are essentially different countries. For example in my state of NY the death rate is insanely high.
6434,hzc3o9,How is that helpful in criticising Trump?
6435,hzc3o9,How much cognitive dissonance do you need to have to post those memes without making that connection. It’s kind of impressive.

6448,hzc3o9,"yeah and it will be funny to watch all the lib's faces when trump 2.0 wins in 2024 and his first action is to cancel all medicare subsidies.

it's not funny at all and our country is going to elect a fascist either way in 2024"

6451,hzc3o9,Liberals are not leftists.
6452,hzc3o9,">they’re quickly becoming more he modern centrist democrats 

Wtf did you think they were??"
6453,hzc3o9,Becoming? That’s literally what they’ve been for maybe 30 years now
6454,hzc3o9,"Absolutely. Bigots need to be called out for their behavior, not excused. He talks the same shit with his likeminded friends, so the beliefs have nothing to do with getting people mad. It's truly sickening that they are comfortable enough to talk this way, often in public. This comfort emboldens fascists."
6455,hzc3o9,Let’s not underestimate our opponents. I think there are plenty of smart conservatives who have thought long and hard about race and have still arrived at the wrong conclusion.
6456,hzc3o9,Agreed
6457,hzc3o9,What connections are those that you're implying? It's pretty straightforward where the virus originated from and how it was spread around the world through our extensive travel networks. As much as climate change is a problem I don't see how that's got anything to do with any of the issues this year so far lol.
6458,hzc3o9,"Still, having like every 20th comment being from BEEP BOOP YOU'RE RACIST BOT because people criticize far-right conspiratorial bullshit is distracting.

I get why the mods have it, and I'm not saying they should 86 it or anything, but it's still distracting and I feel like it could probably be better-tuned."
6459,hzc3o9,Seriously though.
6460,hzc3o9,"point taken. But still, that's only one fewer complaint about how he handled the pandemic."
6461,hzc3o9,It probably isn't. Because not everything necessarily has to be about Trump. If you're going out of your way to try to bend every situation to confirm your previous bias towards Trump then you're very narrow minded.
6462,hzc3o9,Haha thanks! No worries

6468,hzc3o9,I was talking to OP momo
6469,hzc3o9,Correct. But they seem to be unaware of that fact and how much of a problem that is. Complacency running rampant.
6470,hzc3o9,[deleted]
6471,hzc3o9,That's exactly what I thought they were.
6472,hzc3o9,"Yes but it's been a process. They didn't just wake up one day embracing the conservative ""values"" of the 80's and 90's. My intention wasn't to imply that this is just now happening, it was to point out that this process is picking up speed with the way they're willing to do things like looking the other way when voting for an alleged rapist (whilst flaunting hashtags like ""me too"" and ""believe women"")."
6473,hzc3o9,I'm not underestimating the ones in power. I see where we're headed. I just don't accredit the whole with their accomplishments because the vast majority are a dribbling hive mind just following orders.
6474,hzc3o9,"I grabbed the top [link out of the pile](https://phys.org/news/2020-07-video-deforestation-key-pandemic.html) that ""pandemic deforestation"" got me."

mods gotta be proactive instead of setting automod on autopilot and calling it good"
6476,hzc3o9,"Right? I'm trying to figure out what word I used triggered it. Globalist maybe? 

Seems like it should be for slurs, not all alt-right buzzwords. How do we talk about fighting the fascists if we can't talk about the buzzwords and dog whistles they use?

Edit: Yeah. It was Globalist lmao"
6477,hzc3o9,I do not have a bias toward Trump wtf. Quite the opposite.
6478,hzc3o9,"maybe the word ""globalist"" sets it off? I guess I'll find out when it scans this comment lmao"
6479,hzc3o9,"The difference is the cause. They aren’t being called racial slurs, first of all, but we aren’t speaking out against them because of their race. When we speak out about marginalized voices, they are marginalized because of their race"
6480,hzc3o9,You posted on a social media site is what you did.
6481,hzc3o9,Complacency is as bad as complicity.  If you see something and do nothing about it you're as bad as the one actually doing it.
6482,hzc3o9,Or you can educate them and stop being all 🤷🏻‍♀️ since complacency is not exclusive to one group.
6483,hzc3o9,"_I am not! you are!_

Right-wingers are children."
6484,hzc3o9,Why did you say they’re “quickly becoming” though? Line have always been centrist af
6485,hzc3o9,"Yeah, I think you’re very wrong about that. I think most conservatives are thinking people with a complex worldview, and it’s exactly the attitude that you hold that is keeping them trapped in their echo chambers. When they step outside of them, they hear nothing but disdain and condemnation."

6491,hzc3o9,"I'm sorry, I'm missing the part where I said I don't attempt to. Or did you just assume that's what the case was?"
6492,hzc3o9,"Because, while what you said is true, all parties have evolved. Liberal meant something different even 10 years ago. As did every political system. Why do you think conservatives always throw out that they're "" the party of Lincoln"" and other irrelevant shit? When you look at Democrats nowadays as opposed to what Gore wanted to do regarding climate change, their embrace of capitalistic politics would never allow that kind of change. Terms are subjective and what I said was the best way I could word it without writing an essay. If you read it in a way that causes you to disagree with it, even though we agree on the broad logistics, then you interpreted differently that I intended."
6493,hzc3o9,"That's an unfair assumption to make. I've had many civil conversations with many conservatives, as that's mostly who I'm surrounded by. It's not my disagreement with them that forms my opinion. It's the lack of, as you said, complex worldview that prevents them from having any consideration for an opinion other than their own, even when presented with facts. The denial of proven fact and inability to let it affect their worldview is what's preventing them from stepping outside of their echo chamber, not me. In my experience, they have no intention of stepping out. They're comfortable with their racism and will protect it at any cost, especially embracing ignorance."
6494,hzc3o9,"I don't know about ""most"". From all accounts it's more like ""some"", ""a few"", and ""occasionally you meet a""."
6495,hzc3o9,aha yup that must be it then
6496,hzc3o9,"Sorry bud. Also, I forgive ya. 😀"
6497,hzc3o9,Fair enough. I’m just really skeptical whenever someone even hints at libs being more than centrist.
6498,hzc3o9,"Liberal hasn't changed in the last 10 years. It's just that the right has gone so far to the right that, to them, liberals now are leftists even though liberalism was always centrism"
6499,hzc3o9,That would literally mean that over 31 million people in this country are knowingly and happily racist. There’s no way that’s true.
6500,hzc3o9,Well maybe we should get the fuck outta here with our racist selves then. Thanks bot.
6501,hzc3o9,Not a problem. Been there lol
6502,hzc3o9,No I totally get that. I'm just seeing more and more how understanding centrists can be of literal Nazism and I never thought I'd have to force myself to be so aware of my own naivety. They have more weak standards than the right. At least conservatives will get on a pedestal and defend their fucked up ideals. Centrists just kind of agree with whoever's yelling the loudest these days.
6503,hzc3o9,"Maybe it is. Or more likely, they don't know they're racist. I've been racist in my life and thought I was just being realistic. Honestly that should be talked about more often and it's not."
6504,hzc3o9,"My own useless anecdotal evidence:

My dad doesn't think he's racist, but he sure-fuck is."

This fella designs them to be printed on Avery labels. And makes all his designs available to be printed by anyone. But you could take that same idea and run with it.  [https://twitter.com/leftiststickers](https://twitter.com/leftiststickers)   


But, screen printing, or block printing, or letter press, etc. are all awesome things to learn and do, and there's a pretty rich history of each in leftist propaganda.  Although, It's definitely a different quality homemade, than ordering from someone with an industrial printer.

For bigger print runs you can ask allert action fund or the vrije bond solidarity fund for a (pretty big) contribution"
6688,davlzg,"Depending on how durable you're looking to make your sticks, there are a few ways to go about it!   


Quickest, cheapest, and easiest: getting sharpie and a handful of 228 Priority Shipping labels from your local post office.   


If you're willing to invest a little more in materials, relief printing is pretty fun and easy too.   
You just need some carving material, a knife/gouge, some ink, and a roller. From there, you can print on paper, wood, duct-tape, t-shirts, hats. Sticker paper, label material, vinyl.   
(i do most of my sticks with linoleum or wood carves, with black oil inks, on permanent Oracal ""651"" matte vinyl. Then finished with a clear acrylic water/uv proofing spray.)  


And, if you've got a few bucks to burn, you could get them made by a real printer like in the OP.  
There's some folks who already offer designs, or you could get them custom printed for probably less than fifty bucks for a good sized pile."

6697,gvofc0,"Isn't running over people, you know, illegal?"
6698,gvofc0,"Hey, friendly Canadian here.

This isn't necessarily CBC lying or covering things up. The [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.cbc.ca/television) is publicly funded and has a [set of standards](https://www.cbc.ca/productionfacilities/content/pdf/CBC-Program-Standards-Practices.pdf) that they adhere to with regards to programming and reporting. It along with CBC Newsworld are played in many public places at all times of the day. It is the main network that everyone watches and occupies a place [in Canadian society] that doesn't really have an equivalent in the US. 

The Canadian public has some different sensibilities as to what is suitable for a general public than those of the American public. Generally speaking violence is less acceptable to Canadian viewers. On the other hand nudity or suggestive situations are less bothersome to Canadian viewers than American ones. In fact movies and TV shows will often receive different ratings in the US and Canada because of this.

The [Canadian Radio Telecommunications Commission](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/home-accueil.htm) is the regulatory body that decides what is allowed on TV. In the past when violent imagery has been shown they tend to receive a lot of complaints from viewers. Particular when something is shown at a time when children might see it. As the CBC is a public broadcaster they tend to err on the side of caution when it comes to showing violent or disturbing images.

Following public complaints about the shortened video CBC has decided to remove it entirely from its platform rather than showing the truck hit the protesters..

https://www.straight.com/news/cbc-news-admits-video-of-police-behaviour-in-new-york-did-not-meet-its-journalistic-standards

TL;DR- Not hiding the truth, the Canadian public has different sensibilities from the US.

6704,gvofc0,"What is the context for this? Because if they lied to say the police didn't try to run down civilians, I'd see the problem, but if they didn't run the full clip because they didn't want to traumatize viewers, but still described it accurately, then I would say that's probably the responsible thing to do."

They are pervasive in most American cities, collect donations and sell merchandise to raise money for their violent anti protests, mostly aimed at peaceful conservatives who have committed the grave act of having different opinions on economics to them. They attack Jews, POC, and liberals alike if they dare share an opposing view or wear a red hat with white embroidery. They literally chant ‘liberals get the bullet too’ and despise democracy more than they do fascism. Their acts on the streets of Portland and other major cities can be seen as nothing more than fascistic (suppressing opposing views through violence) and has been well documented since 2016. Before 2016 CNN described them as thugs and terrorists, post 2016 they refer to them as protestors. You need to stop playing into the hands of communists who want the end of liberal democracy before you do research on the seriousness of the antifa cells across America. These people want to destroy our societies and stoke racial hatred and you are helping them. Antifa are using BLM’s grievances to get what they want whilst POC are arrested and killed in the process, frankly it is an extremely racist organisation that wants the races to be at each other’s throats so they can achieve their anarcho-communist ‘utopia’"

The CBC is Canada's public broadcaster. I value their reporting and investigative journalism, and so should you! 

The link below is their page for Journalistic Standards and Practices. Under the section for War, Terror, and Natural Disasters, in states the following:

""We reflect the reality of the situations we report. We also respect the sensibilities of our viewers, listeners and readers.

**We respect our audience by assessing the impact of our images according to time of day and the context of the program where such material is appearing.**""

Black Americans were not destined to fail from birth. That is what was expected and desired to happen from the powers that be, but it is against human nature to not over come hurdles. Every safe guard to hamper a population fuels the same drive to overcome it.

Failure can be prescribed, but people can't be forced to imbibe.

6755,gvofc0,people on twitter were saying that's the CBC probably clipped it because of graphic violence being showed on TV. not sure though
6756,gvofc0,"It's not anywhere near graphic violence though. It's horrible and wrong, but it's newsworthy and it doesn't show anything graphic."
6757,gvofc0,No. I've seen many deaths on twitter - including George Floyd's.
6758,gvofc0,"Thanks. I have no doubt that the MSM would do this, but I am also certain that there are powers that be hoping to stoke up violence and putting edited footage would definitely be a way to do it"
6759,gvofc0,"while reading the thread i found someone giving this link ([yt video by CBC](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=6m37s&v=YuFRHX7wb7I)) from the news channel saying that they did show it at a later time, and that it wasn't shown because of graphic violence as justification. can someone confirm?"
6760,gvofc0,"The CBC is the only reason we have any decent reporting on this country, because all of our other news networks are owned by even less organisations than own all the USA media. That's why there's such a massive movement to get rid of it. If we lose the CBC, we'll be in a media hellscape even worse than USA and that's something to truly fear.

With that said, the CBC has let me down a lot on some issues. They parroted the Fox News lie that the Quebec mosque shooter was a Somali immigrant before the police released their official statement, and they act like any other MSM in their push of ads and quick release deadlines over quality reporting. The CBC still does exceptional work, but they're very disappointing in some areas."
6761,gvofc0,"Editing your source (transcript, video, audio, etc) to change the context, for example hiding police committing assault with a deadly weapon, without explicitly informing the viewer of said edits is propaganda, not journalism; I fail to understand how you could argue otherwise. 

Trying to justify all of this with an appeal to emotion for the time of day and context of where this news is shown is the cherry on top of this horrible yellow-journalism sundae."
6762,gvofc0,"That's a crock of shit. If they wanted to censor it, they could blur the entire screen at the time of the cut so all you see is two white blobs running over a mass of colors. Alternatively, they could show something saying that the rest of the clip is too disturbing to show, but leave a link to the whole clip.

This is propaganda, intentional or not."
6763,gvofc0,"I completely agree. 

It's a disgraceful decision for a news network. Casts their impartiality into question.

Perhaps. But we have 2 VERY different governments and while Canadians may very much have a surface resemblance to Americans we have a different set of values and priorities.

>and there were points made about censorship of graphic content on TV. 

I've seen this discussion crop up a number of times. *Most* Canadians I've seen seem to be in agreement that this would be something shocking on Canadian TV.

6779,gvofc0,"I mean, if it looks like someone MIGHT have died then yeah I'm sure they would on US tv. I'm pretty sure there's a law against showing an actual in act death on TV, like tits, unless it's historical or native probably, because that's like... You know, different.

I haven't watched cable TV in several years and few exceptions. Anyone here know if they showed three George Floyd death? I'm sure everyone saw a little bit of knee but not the part where he technically passed. I'm just curious if I'm right."
6780,gvofc0,I haven't actually seen the tweet. I'm assuming they did not mention that there was more to be seen.
6781,gvofc0,"> It's not anywhere near graphic violence though.

Things are viewed differently in Canada. There is much less acceptance of violence on TV than in the US."
6782,gvofc0,Fair enough. That's a good point.
6783,gvofc0,"yeah, definitely. I think it's always important to ask for a source and confirm what you're seeing. it's especially important for gathering respectable evidence against authorities that already have more power"
6784,gvofc0,I’m not in the least surprised. I was involved with occupy and you have no idea what the powers that be are capable of to try to discredit a movement.
6785,gvofc0,">it wasn't shown because of graphic violence as justification. can someone confirm?

Here you go. Speaking as a Canadian and someone who regularly watches CBC and listens to CBC radio in both languages this is entirely plausible. Canadian viewers have different sensibilities for violence on public TV than American ones.

https://www.straight.com/news/cbc-news-admits-video-of-police-behaviour-in-new-york-did-not-meet-its-journalistic-standards"
6786,gvofc0,that's very likely the case though I can't say for sure
6787,gvofc0,I have seen both versions on CBC (but I don't remember the timing)
6788,gvofc0,"> The CBC is the only reason we have any decent reporting on this country, because all of our other news networks are owned by even less organisations than own all the USA media. That's why there's such a massive movement to get rid of it. If we lose the CBC, we'll be in a media hellscape even worse than USA and that's something to truly fear.

This is particularly true for French language programming. The programming and journalism provided in French would be much less varied and robust.

>With that said, the CBC has let me down a lot on some issues. They parroted the Fox News lie that the Quebec mosque shooter was a Somali immigrant before the police released their official statement, and they act like any other MSM in their push of ads and quick release deadlines over quality reporting.

Apart a few instances like this however they tend to be the calm voice of reason when dealing with breaking news and developing situations. Their journalism by and large is trusted and well respected."
6789,gvofc0,"> they act like any other MSM in their push of ads and quick release deadlines over quality reporting.


The solution to this is simple; Don’t allow them to take ad revenue and instead ensure that they’re fully funded either through taxes, a TV license fee like the BBC, or some combination of these things or other alternatives. 


But that’s the exact opposite of what the loudmouth pricks who don’t like CBC want. They want it gone because it doesn’t blindly parrot the American anarcho-capitalist talking points that they’ve been told will turn them from trailer trash to multi-billionaires just so long as they keep putting blue signs on their property every four years."
6790,gvofc0,In the end they decided to remove the video entirely rather than show the shortened clip.
6791,gvofc0,"No.  If tempted to do that, please donate to a bail fund instead.  BLM protesters need it way more than Reddit does.

But thanks for the appreciation."
6792,gvofc0,"Meh, I like CBC. Growing up there was no TV and all we had was CBC radio. Not many people these days have ever sat down and listened to a radio play."

6794,gvofc0,Why would the driver be scared? They only have reason to be scared after they hit the protesters.
6795,gvofc0,"Yeah, by reversing instead of going into the crowd for example"
6796,gvofc0,The magic of reverse...

6798,gvofc0,">I'm pretty sure there's a law against showing an actual in act death on TV

I don't think there is, although I don't think they show things like that in time slots where kids are likely to still be up."
6799,gvofc0,"All great points! Also I know lots of the haters are made because the CBC has a significant amount of indigenous programming that they feel is ""unnecessary"" because they're racist pricks. So yes, just reinforces that our mediascape in Canada would suffer a lot without the CBC."
6800,gvofc0,"I know, it's just also frustrating seeing the CBC act like a typical capitalist news organisation. I want it to be better, and it's frustrating seeing that its not. I completely agree though, they need to be banned from ad revenue and funded through alternative means."

6805,gvofc0,"> I don't think there is, although I don't think they show things like that in time slots where kids are likely to still be up.

Canada has far different standards than the US, particularly with CBC which is a public broadcaster. By and large Canadians will accept less violence on TV but are far less bothered by things like nudity or foul language. We look pretty much like you guys, but there are a few cultural differences."

Doing this would change nothing, sadly. You can't change the system from the inside; it can only change you. By the time you've done your good deed, you've done so much evil for the institution that it doesn't matter anymore. The police must be dissolved and replaced with local directly-democratic institutions.

What does it mean when [people](https://archive.is/LYBa9) say that all cops are bastards (ACAB)?

If it were an individual thing, you'd give them the benefit of the doubt, but it isn't; it's an institutional thing. the job itself is a bastard, therefore by carrying out the job, they are bastards. To take it to an extreme: there were no good members of the gestapo because there was no way to carry out the directives of the gestapo and to be a good person. it is the same with the american police state. [Police do not exist to protect and serve, according to the US supreme court itself,](https://archive.is/gHlb4) but to dominate, control, and terrorize in order to maintain the interests of state and capital. 

Who are the good cops then? The ones who either quit or are [fired](https://archive.is/lZrC5) for refusing to do the job.

While the following list focuses on the US as a model police state, ALL cops in ALL countries are derivative from very similar violent traditions of modern policing, rooted in old totalitarian regimes, genocides, and slavery, if not the mere maintenance of authoritarian power structures through terrorism.

 - [police shoot people twice as often as previously thought.](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/xwvv3a/shot-by-cops) Keep in mind that this was self-reported, so we have no way of knowing if these numbers speak to the actual number of shootings in the US. Many of these people are completely unarmed. Police kill far, *far* more people than terrorists in the US and have killed over a hundred people more than mass shooters did in 2019 *that we are aware of.* Mass shooters are easily tracked. Police killings are not. [1](https://archive.is/rwRJ5) [2](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-in-the-us-2019-042820.pdf/view)

 - Oh, and cops also killed more people in 2019 than school shooters did [**in all of US history.**](https://archive.is/fZp9V) 

 - [And if they don't shoot you, they might just airstrike your block and burn your children alive.](https://archive.is/mNjqB)

 - [They also shoot one dog every hour, every day.](https://archive.is/UtPiG) At the absolute least.

[It's so bad that people constantly plead guilty just so they can get out.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/innocent-man-pleaded-guilty-drug-charge-get-out-jail-it-n1067321) It's so bad and so common, in fact, that [over a third of all exonerations come after an individual has pleaded guilty.](https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Exonerations%20in%202018.pdf) So much for the right to a speedy trial, huh?

 - And getting arrested is easy - tens of thousands of people yearly, in fact, thanks to lowest bidder garbage that police departments use in order to test for illicit substances. Field drug tests are about as reliable as lie detector tests or horoscopes. [They just don't work.](https://www.propublica.org/article/common-roadside-drug-test-routinely-produces-false-positives)

 - Think you're safe if you just follow directions? [Yeah, no.](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/12/graphic-video-shows-police-killing-of-unarmed-man-in-arizona.html) And if they don't just outright kill you, they could make their instructions [so arcane and hard to follow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OflGwyWcft8) that they'll kill you for not following them, and they'll usually get away with it. He got away with it, [by the way.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/arizona-police-shooting-killed-man-crawling-floor-killed-a8100326.html) Surprise!

It's probable that they've stolen far more than just this.

 - [police are literally allowed to rape people on the job in 35 states,](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertsamaha/this-teenager-accused-two-on-duty-cops-of-rape-she-had-no) as they have the power to determine whether or not you consented to sex with them while in their custody.

 - [up to 50% of the people police murder are disabled](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/29/media-must-report-police-violence-towards-disabled-people)

 - [the police are being trained to kill as if they're an occupying army and we're an insurgency.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETf7NJOMS6Y) this is an inevitability, as the military-industrial complex needs to keep expanding into new markets.

 - Eugenics was still alive and well in the prison-industrial complex up until very recently, and could very well be continuing for all we know, as [it was forcibly sterilizing inmates as late as 2010.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/08/california-female-prisoner-sterilization) I honestly don't see a reason to believe it's stopped. 

 - The [US surveillance state is massive](https://qz.com/1670686/the-us-has-a-lot-in-common-with-chinas-surveillance-state/) (and while this post primarily focuses on the US, [other countries are just as bad](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13718768/uk-surveillance-laws-explained-investigatory-powers-bill)), though much of our surveillance is privatized. [This doesn't stop the police from partnering with private companies, however.](https://archive.is/bL5fT) This will only get worse as time goes on. Also, we can't forget about the Patriot Act and [Snowden's PRISM leaks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)

 - the police, as an institution, are so completely steeped in violence, that [up to 40% of them commit acts of domestic violence and other forms of domestic abuse.](http://womenandpolicing.com/violencefs.asp) Most citizens are not even allowed to own firearms if found guilty of domestic violence, and these guys are expected to handle military-grade equipment.

 - [Police exist to control and terrorize us,](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-day-ferguson-cops-were-caught-in-a-bloody-lie) not serve and protect us. That's only their function if you happen to be rich and powerful.

also this: [lol](https://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836)

[the police as they are now haven't even existed for 200 years as an institution,](https://libcom.org/history/origins-police-david-whitehouse) and the modern police force was founded to control crowds and catch slaves, [not to ""serve and protect""](https://libcom.org/history/stop-kidding-yourself-police-were-created-control-working-class-poor-people-sam-mitrani) -- unless you mean serving and protecting what people call ""the 1%."" They have a long history of controlling the working class by intimidating, harassing, assaulting, and even [murdering strikers during labor disputes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_worker_deaths_in_United_States_labor_disputes) This isn't a bug; it's a feature.

The justice system also loves to intimidate and [outright assassinate civil rights leaders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton)

The police do not serve justice. The police serve the ruling classes, whether or not they themselves are aware of it. They make our communities far more dangerous places to live, but there are alternatives to the modern police state.

* bisexual men

* pedophiles
* zoophiles

They were used for target practice by the Nazis, abused by other prisoners and re-imprisoned by West-German authorities after the war. Some Nazi-era laws remained in place for decades - even as late as the 1990s gay men were imprisoned for their sexuality."

OF COURSE established world powers like the U.S. or Europe are going to spend more on their police because they have more available!  Their economies are more stable and developed!  This is like saying there's a bigger tourism sector in Europe versus Venezuela.  Or saying a child spends less money on food than an adult.  DUH.

I get it! When Democratic governors and mayors want to take away our freedom and lock us down to our homes in the guise of protecting the public that’s perfectly fine but when  we want prevent terrorism (foreign and domestic) it’s not okay to use the “guise” of protecting the public.

7159,gyyk9u,"Yeah that's a bit. I can accept that emergency response services should have some degree of redundancy rather than 1:1. I might even possibly see 3 cars for one officer as alright if one goes in the shop, and another has a problem you can use the third and get the second into the shop hopefully by the time the first one comes out... Not say that concept would scale proportionally. The less personel you have, the more redundancy you need to maintain a single person operating at all rather than just reduced efficiency."

7187,gyyk9u," Standard Kevlar ballistic vests used by police in the United States are almost exclusively rated as NIJ Type IIa, II, or IIIa.  High velocity rifle bullets, like those fired from an AR-15 rifle, will  easily penetrate Type IIa, II, or IIIa vests. While these flexible  vests successfully stop most handgun bullets and shotgun rounds at close  range, nearly any projectile traveling faster than 2000 feet per  second will penetrate through any Kevlar vest.  AR-15 rifles usually fire bullets at velocities in excess of 2700 feet  per second."

7192,gyyk9u,"This is a legitimate point but you can't go by cost of living for the city itself as most officers working in large cities tend to not live within those city limits precisely because of the increased cost of living. Easiest way to do it would be to aggregate the cost of living for the whole  metro area around the city (which for a city like New York is a huge area.)

If you think that the precincts would be offering salaries commiserate with the actual cost of living to their cities regardless of where their employees live I can only assume that you are not an American or haven't yet had to enter the job market."

7195,gyyk9u,"Ukraine isn’t a dictatorship but they can’t even beat a small enclave of rebels because their military is so poor.

Iraq isn’t a dictatorship anymore either, but they have been ripped apart by a bunch of untrained terrorists with trucks as their tanks, so yeah pretty poor militarily.

All in all, pretty poor comparisons"
7196,gyyk9u,"Police don't investigate most crimes, especially in cities. Mayors want high arrests and summonses because the numbers look good for tourism and real estate, so police officers must arrest and give summonses to people. But if those are middle or upper class people, they are far more likely to contest the charges because they have lawyers. So you only go after poor people, even if they're doing nothing wrong.

In Minneapolis, only 22% of rape cases were cleared, and 56% of cases where someone was killed. And those are where cases were opened: there are 1700 untested rape kits, and a case cleared isn't always a case solved. Not to mention that precincts are rewarded for low serious crime rates, meaning they are far less likely to enter a serious crime into the database: they either won't input it or downgrade it. This happens in cities across America. In NYC a story was done on this after cops began to speak out on the matter. One talks about how a prostitute who was raped without even discussion of transaction, much less consent, had her rape downgraded to theft of service.

The police have shot and killed more than 5000 people since 2015. Imagine having a 9/11 every three years, except committed by our own police force. Many of these individuals did not deserve it. We often are able to take in violent armed individuals who have already killed people without harming them: this amount of death is clearly unnecessary. These people did not need to die regardless of the crimes they did or did not commit. Other countries do not have this issue.

In Camden, New Jersey, they dismantled the police force and rebuilt it from the ground up through community led enforcement. Camden was one of the most dangerous cities in America. The homicide rate plunged from 67 in 2012 to 25 in 2019. Almost all crime rates fell. Sure, it wasn't only the complete overhaul of policing that contributed to this. But it sure helped. And consider this: complaints of excessive police force dropped 95%."
7197,gyyk9u,"A huge portion of police department funds don’t go to investigation or preventing crime, it goes to buying surplus military equipment they don’t need and only get used to oppress people exercising their constitutional rights.

Those strikes are called like that because the victims need a lot of surgery to survive), instating dictatorship, giving money to terrorist organisations and killing civilians with diverse weapons (sometimes chemical weapons, because it's funnier I guess.), isn't exactly ""helping""."
7240,gyyk9u,"it really helped latin america, africa and asia god bless 🙏🙏"
7241,gyyk9u,Crazy thing is it’s only about 750 dollars a year per New Yorker.
7242,gyyk9u,You don’t deserve downvotes.

7248,gyyk9u,"as an hamburger let me assure you: they don‘t. they love to smash leftist, and tolerate right wing protests.
when ronald schill became innensenator in 2001 the police went full on ‚law and order‘ and it never changed back. in 2014 the budget was around 640 million € for two years, in 2019 it was 880 million for one year. 
they still have their „gefahrengebiete“ in place where they can search you without a warrant or any reason + they love their racial profiling. 
some names and words you want to google: ronald schill, hartmut dudde, olaf scholz, andy grote, brechmitteleinsatz, achidi john"

7250,gyyk9u,"In beating up left-wingers, assaulting people in police stations, supporting Nazis, emptying squats and protecting private property?"
7251,gyyk9u,"And to reinforce that, higher education is extremely expensive or just more indoctrination. You have to borrow a lot of money from the government to get deprogrammed by going to college, and even then, you can stay in the neoliberal/neocon/alt right fairytale if you want. 

One of the most sinister (and therefore probably true) things I heard about politicians opposing universal healthcare and student loan forgiveness was “then nobody will have a reason to join the military!” I understand people not wanting to join the sick fetishization of our military, but when you look at the demographics and recruitment patterns, it’s disgusting how *poor people* are exploited by the military, so I have a harder time just writing it off as “they know what they signed up for.” Yes, there are fascist fucks in the military, but it’s ultimately the system that’s at fault and I don’t know whether we should focus on changing it first or convincing its Stockholmed enablers not to oppose us when we try to change it.

Sorry, that was a weird rant but this shit seriously gets to me."

7258,gyyk9u,"Just a heads up, but ""The Ukraine"" is considered offensive by most Ukrainians. It's just Ukraine, and adding the 'the' implies it is just a region as it was in the USSR, rather than the independent nation state that it is now."
7259,gyyk9u,"I mean, Kharkov is right on the front. But there's no actual campaign trying to advance fast, is mor elope a war if attrition for both sides, with neither side really committing seriously.

7267,gyyk9u,"And most of the money don't even go to cool shit. Like every 50 years we might get some cool space shit or the internet, but the rest of the time we're just throwing money at lock head Martin. Billions wasted on failed projects that never had any business being developed."

7271,gyyk9u,We did. See Crimea.
7272,gyyk9u,bro what would we do if the military wasn't spending billions developing a better cruise missile to fire at a funeral from a drone
7273,gyyk9u,And I agree

7281,gyyk9u,"Not necessarily. A small country can have a high incarceration rate while having a relatively small number of people incarcerated. 
What is remarkable about the US having the highest number of incarcerated people is that there are countries with 3 or 4 times our population (and also more overtly oppressive governments) that don’t incarcerate as many people as we do."
7282,gyyk9u,"A lot of gang related shootings combined with corrupt and incompetent police and a corrupt mayor that has been our mayor for at least 20 years.  Most years around 70 percent go unsolved, with thier best year (recently) being 50 percent unsolved/solved.  That 50 percent is bunk though, im sure this year will be a return to normalcy, prob be worse with all the chaos.

The police just dont give a shit about the impoverished neighborhoods around here.  The east side of buffalo is like a wild west free for all.  The cops do the bare minimum to stop the crime, and some even participate in it."

7303,gyyk9u,"I guess it made sense when it was a region. It would have been like referring to a general region such as ""The Midwest"".

In the context of Ukraine being an independent state it makes no sense, but I guess a lot of people have the old way ingrained in their mind. Also can't help that it's pretty uncommon to have a proper noun starting with a 'U' in English, so English speakers are probably more comfortable adding a 'the'."

7322,gyyk9u,Nah at that point the US would simply just be the worlds military. Also probably a moonbase too. (As long as it has missiles.)
7323,gyyk9u,Yes that’s the clue it’s a hyperbolic statement.
7324,gyyk9u,"source on that? im a russian citizen, i have relatives in crimea. theyre still alive yk"
7325,gyyk9u,"Exactly, that was my point. A higher cost per citizen just means that people are being payed more. You'd have to account for the salary disparities in different countries to make any meaningful conclusions."
7326,gyyk9u,"yes i realize how targeted the multi billion dollar media circuits are that talk about ""a few bad cops"" and the evil bevil windy smashy looters.

thanks for pointing that out. now try reading a fucking book on police history, or any theoretical work on power produced since the 1750s. you are the ignorant one here, and no matter how hard you try to maintain your civil bougie attitude that doesnt change."
7327,gyyk9u,"You know, I got in this thread from someone linking from another thread about defunding the police that I dipped from popular and I didn't even notice and I was thinking this is weird... why fuck are so many people understanding and not full of shit... this is so unlike most threads I go in from popular... and then I read that and I was like... uh... oh, well that makes sense now. Sort of had the emotion of the  tiniest spark of hope there for a just a moment just to be dashed."
7328,gyyk9u,"> This is antifa

Shhhhh!  They might go after our President."
7329,gyyk9u,I know but these governments what to impose their authoritarian ways into other people. They back dictators in other countries similar to the United States did. Russia in backing Assad in Syria. The PRC is a dictatorship and wants to export its idea of internet surveillance and censorship all over the world. We must counter them

7332,gyyk9u,Wow you are totally brainwashed
7333,gyyk9u,"I hope you realize that the US and its military arm is the single most authoritarian, aggressive and imperialistic organization that has ever existed, a million times worse that PRC and Russia combined. Calling PRC a dictatorship while simultaneously favoring the US military over it is ridiculous. ""We must counter them"" no we must counter the US military and you should be supporting Assad just for that"
7334,gyyk9u,"First of all, NEWS YAHOO. everyones favorite site for objective reporting

Second of all, the article is about **pro-russian separatists**, not russia itself. You could argue that russia probably armed those rebels, sure, but that has nothing to do with the annexation, which leads us to my third point:

The article never mentions crimea. Its about Luhansk/Donetsk, and all of those are completely separate regions.

Did you even read the article or did you just send me the first google result?

The annexation itself happened through an illegal referendum. There was no war"
7335,frp9nv,"The story as he wrote it in one of his books:

When i got home that day, it was past midnight. When i got home, i found my mother sitting on the staircase outside our door. 

She was waiting for me. I approached her and said ""Mother""!

She stood up, grabbed me by the neck and took me back to the kitchen so that the neighbors couldn't hear us. She asked me ""where were you""?

I opened the inside pocket of my jacket and showed her a piece of the swastika flag that i had cut. She hugged me, kissed me and told me to ""go to sleep"".

The next morning, i heard the following dialogue coming from the kitchen. My stepfather was asking my mother ""where was your eldest son last night""?

and she replied: ""Go up on the rooftop and have a look at the acropolis hill""."
7336,frp9nv,"""The night before every guerilla attack we would gather and talk. And we would say: If you live, don't forget me. When you meet people on the street, tell them goodmorning for me too. When you drink wine, drink wine for me too. When you hear the sound of the waves, hear it for me too. And when you dance, dance for me too!""."
7337,frp9nv,"This is not just a story about how a rebellious teenager that wanted to see his country, his people free.

This is a story of a fighter that kept fighting for his people. About a man fighting against the unjust regimes of nazi occupation, post civil war Greece and military junta. How he kept fighting for the people despite multiple imprisoments, exiles and death sentences throughout those regimes. And still at his old years, during the economic crisis protests he was there, fighting in the front lines. [Tear gassed point blank](http://s.enet.gr/resources/2010-03/glezos-2-thumb-large.jpg),  beaten and arrested. At the age of 90.

But the most important, it is a story about why he kept fighting. As he implied in an interview: *""Why do I go on? Why I am doing this when I am 92 years and two months old? I could, after all, be sitting on a sofa in slippers with my feet up. So why do I do this? You think the man sitting opposite you is Manolis but you are wrong. I am not him. And I am not him because I have not forgotten that every time someone was about to be executed [during WWII], they said: 'Don't forget me. When you say good morning, think of me. When you raise a glass, say my name.' And that is what I am doing talking to you, or doing any of this. The man you see before you is all those people. And all this is about not forgetting them.""*

Edit: Like today in March 30 1952, [Nikos Bellogiannis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Beloyannis) was executed. Like Glezos, his comrade was a prominent communist figure and was sentenced to execution on the bogus claim of USSR spy. What a tragic coincidence. 

A lot of people protested against his execution, among them Picaso who sketched in his honor [the man with the carnation.](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-WfmLdrU-qdI%2FVvu7LmUZ0NI%2FAAAAAAAAAXs%2FLfeyrD30JekbaU0sK502r_3gUTR5rUorQ%2Fs1600%2FBeloyannis%252Bby%252BPicasso%252BPablo.jpg&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.idcommunism.com%2F2016%2F03%2Fthe-man-with-carnation-64-years-since.html&tbnid=ywAleCpAJbrggM&vet=12ahUKEwjhu9GLusLoAhUYxOAKHSPxAVUQMygDegQIARB7..i&docid=gzBNmjExe7SFLM&w=524&h=758&q=the%20man%20with%20the%20carnation&safe=off&client=tablet-android-samsung&ved=2ahUKEwjhu9GLusLoAhUYxOAKHSPxAVUQMygDegQIARB7)"

This monument is for the protestors killed that day. They were around the same age of Glezos when he tore down the Nazi flag. They were very similar to his fallen comrades.

7386,dmhmj8,"Lebanese person here. Lebanon is currently going through a revolutionary window of mass uprisings and is in the 8th day of a general strike. The army has declared a stance of neutrality in that it will not move against the protestors and will also defend them against counter-revolutionary actors. This is important because the mass uprisings are calling for the removal of a ruling class consisting of more than 8 political parties, all with armed and organized members. In the last day or two the army was asked to clear a main highway  (they claim for the passage of humanitarian goods - ambulances and gas and food) following that 'clash' several army members were seen visibly shaken and broke down. There are videos of protestors consoling them. The relationship between the masses and the army is generally a good one in Lebanon with the army mainly serving a counter terrorism role (mostly against isis in the last several years and before that against similar religious fanatics - fascists). Joining the army is one of the only ways for people in poverty to secure a salary and benefits (Healthcare, schooling for children, retirement - these rights are currently on the chopping block due to austerity and the command for retired soldiers has come out in support of the protests) and the punishment for insubordination is severe. There have also been pictures of soldiers with signs saying we support you but can't join you. None of this is to say that the soldiers are allies, but they can be if the right pressure is applied, the fact that they are acting as a barrier to counter revolution is a net positive for Lebanon revolution. This is all to say that revolutionary processes are different in every country. Just wanted to add this bit of context to the post."

Y'all have no idea what this man's life was. He's a Lebanese soldier, not american. Who's to say he has the same guarantees and safety if he refuses his orders? Who the fuck here knows if he has a family that he would not be able to support were he not to join the army. Do any of you hateful cunts know if he just joined the army to escape dirt-poor poverty?

It's real fucking easy to assume the worst in people, the fascist assholes that spread hate and ignorance out there have shown us that. What we should be doing instead is ridding ourselves of this ignorance and see that the world isn't black and white.

So grow up, because if this shit right here is what the Anti-Fascist movement has in store for the future, we are fucking fucked."

7408,dmhmj8,"With OP saying ""I was just following orders"" There is a scientific study which was brought up a few years back for a man studying the same reasoning nazi soldiers were killing. They were all saying ""Just following orders"". Not justifying this man for shooting peaceful protesters (If it did happened or not) But in a military situation, you have very little room to not follow orders and get repercussions for doing so. But soldiers are allowed to not follow orders if its widely agreed that is ""unconstitutional"" In which I think its a way to pin the blame on soldiers.

7426,dmhmj8,"^ absolutely correct. The Lebanese army was designed to be weak and neutral/non-sectarian.

7435,dmhmj8,"Very fair point. But at least we can see (if this is all 100% true) that he won't be acting this way again. What he presumably did is terrible and he should be punished. But it's the people who enjoy doing what he presumably did that are several times worse. Those who put their ideology over innocent people by force and enjoy it. But there's a lot of factors. Like someone else said he's probably in the army for the salary and benefits, maybe he needed the money and for a moment money and the stability it provided for him and maybe a family meant more to him than his morals. Which should never happen. All I'm saying is don't lump him in with actual fascists. With everything there is black and white and gray area. What he presumably did was completely wrong. But true fascists, people who see no wrong in governmentalized terrorism are way worse."
7436,dmhmj8,"It's important to note that not *every* country is an oppressive, imperialist shitwad like the USA. You join the US military, you are consciously deciding to support imperialism and fascism, the same being true of the UK, France, etc - but that isn't the case with smaller countries, like Lebanon. People in countries like this join the military because their military *actually does* exist to defend their country and, usually, fight for good; which makes it all the more harder when something like this happens, where they are put into a situation and given orders that are NOT what they signed up for.

Ultimately it still comes down to the individual whether they choose to obey a wrongful order or not, so this guy doesn't get my sympathy in that regard - he wasn't ""forced"", he chose - but yes, you do raise a valid point that there is a good chance that a significant portion of the military may actually agree with the protesters they are being pitted against."
7437,dmhmj8,"Their job is still to violently, oppressively protect capitalists and the state.  Just under slightly different circumstances or against a different set of people.  In cases where the military is used for repression within a country's own borders, there's no functional difference between it and the police."

7446,dmhmj8,"They are still human. Example, in Vietnam the soldiers started to frag the ones who were pro war. Because you do not send a civilian army to commit atrocities. Because they will rebel. You hire mercenaries to commit atrocities. The State of the U.S. learned from this mistake. Ended the draft and started to use propaganda on the poor communities to recruit soldiers. They are a kind of trained mercenaries but even they rebel. So this is why the US has to use private company soldiers, jihadis, gang members, Dictators, Fascist, proxy wars, etc."
7447,dmhmj8,"I joined the army so I could get a $30k bonus to help my schizophrenic mother who doesn't work save her house from being taken because she couldn't pay back taxes. I had no marketable skills and couldn't afford to take care of the house and taxes with the job I was working.

I hate it every single day but I gotta do it for my family."

7455,dmhmj8,"I'm pretty sure he was forced to considering his reaction to his actions, just because nobody is grabbing his arms and physically forcing him to do it, doesn't mean he wasn't forced. He got an order he didn't wanna follow, but he's in the military, he has no choice. Would you disobey an order if you were in the military? It wouldn't fucking end well for you.

They just take different routes. I have given you the illusion that I gave you a choice. Now I can blame you by saying I did not force you. But I did trick you. I created the environment for it and limited your choices to get my way. And this is a simplification of what the State does. Now imagine at a bigger scale. The tax payer pays for the gun, the gun manufacturer makes the gun, have a poor population eventually one will have to become the soldier because the job market is limited and it all comes into play.

7552,dmhmj8,"I know where and what fragging means. I always knew it as the killing of another solider(s) though, but the reason I even said anything was because I was confused by him saying the response to ""I was just following orders"" was ""fragging"". Fragging wouldn't exactly be a response to someone saying ""I was just following orders"" as much as it would be the actual response to someone ordering you to kill civilians. I wanted clarity on. that, not so much as to what fragging meant. Semantic, I guess."
7553,dmhmj8,No doubt. All I have to add is that there are obvious life changing results that come with this.

The higher probability here is that this man has chosen the military life to escape poverty or provide to a family he couldn't otherwise. And as the top comment posted, consequences for disobeying orders aren't so light as in most countries.

7572,hxse80,"I think if you wanted to blast cops with oil based paint, you'd want to get a five gallon bucket and one of those things you use at the swimming pool to suck up a bunch of water and blast people. Or a battery operated paint sprayer. Even spray paint for crying out loud. Water balloons? I'm doubtful.

every restaurant has to have one - its the K class of fire extinguishers [https://www.ansul.com/en/us/ProductImages/kguard.png](https://www.ansul.com/en/us/ProductImages/kguard.png) the only ones that have liquid and not gas. you pressurize it like you would a car tire at a gas station- DO NOT OVER PRESSURIZE!!!

7648,hxse80,Most cars gas caps cant be accessed without first being in the vehicle
7649,hxse80,"No, it won’t hydrolock. 

Hydro locking occurs when the intake sucks water, usually when someone drives through deep water, the engine tries to compress the water and usually bends a connecting rod. It’s why off road vehicles have snorkels, to keep the intake up away from water.

Filling the gas tank with a sufficient amount of water will make it inoperable, but won’t cause any expensive damage. It just won’t run, since the injectors will be trying to spray water, not fuel. Flush the fuel system and fill it back up and the car will be fine. Water is heavier than gasoline, so the water will settle to the bottom of the tank and be picked up by the fuel pump instead of gasoline. A single water bottle probably wouldn’t disable a car, but a couple gallons would."

7651,hxse80,"I used to work in a tire shop and had to take valve stems off all the time. Unless they have tpms you can just pull them out with a pair of pliers. If they do have tpm (and most newer vehicles do) then you have to get the air out some other way. Inside the the valve stem there's a small metal rod that can be pulled out with some needle nose pliers.

7679,hxse80,"I'm not sure that you'd need to do welding - a wayward nail or especially a screw is enough to do in a typical tire and that sort of width should be possible to bend by hand with pliers.

Also some creative use of pipes and vices should be enough to do it if you're using force correctly.

A modern day action involves rapid movement, anonymity and flexibility.

“Anti-cavalry archers spikes” sounds like just a barricade with extra pointy steps. Do you mean like a Friesian Horse? You want everyone to be lugging around a heavy, cumbersome spikey piece of shit that they might have to abandon any minute? Because I cannot picture what you have in mind. I don’t want to be a dick.

Hollow pipe welded together in such a way as to allow air to escape the tire via a hole near the center of the caltrop or through the other end of the tube would be ideal, [such as this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Caltrop.jpg). Take 2 pieces of tube, bend them to make the shape, weld them together at the middle and drill a hole for the auxiliary air path (in case the opposite end of the tube gets stuck in soft ground or something) and you've got a quick and effective tire deflation caltrop."

1. What’s it like down there? Are you like action man?

2. Did you get to keep them?"
7789,hxse80,"Yeah, it’s one of my favourite words. It’s so versatile. It can be used as a noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb or interjection. It can be combined with other expletives for some very inventive insults. Depending on the circumstance it can be amicable, aggressive or sexual. 

It stems from the Mahabharata, a Sanskrit text or play that describes the Hindu goddess Kunti. She represents the divine power of the female form and leads a matriarchy. 

It’s been in Germanic/Anglo Saxon use since at least the 13th century. 

Personally, I consider the typically American prudish attitude to its use to be an example of misogyny and double standards in language. People won’t bat an eye at calling someone a dick, prick, cock, bell end, knob etc yet create a special set of rules for describing female genitalia. So it’s shunned and in doing so given the authority of hate speech because it can then be used to attack women. 

In other countries it doesn’t have these connotations. It’s still shocking and explicit but can also easily be bantered about without implying anything super negative. Unlike racial slurs, which have an implicit history and no redeeming features, the “C word” can and should be used by everyone. By making it obscene in this way you actually lend power to misogyny and detract from women. In my opinion. Thanks for listening to my TED talk.

The difference between these revolutionary militias and actual cops is that the militia members weren’t cops - they were teachers, farmers, craftsmen of one kind or another. They were serving their community by providing families protection and security. 

By the way, this is literally how the Black Panther Party started. The cops weren’t doing their job in Oakland so some members of the black community there decided to form a neighborhood watch. They armed themselves and made themselves visible and served their community - providing free breakfasts for school kids, continuing education centers for adults, workplace training for people who need job skills.

We know the US police system is corrupt and racist. we make movies and tv shows that hinge on these immutable facts. therefore the system and, by extension, those who engage in it are corrupt and racist.

While I’m glad you and your loved ones were fortunate enough to be sheltered from harm, many of your friends and neighbors haven’t been. My family has been the target of several random assaults. I’ve been in the house when doors were being kicked in, and windows were smashed. I know how little help the police actually are in these situations. My dad was stabbed on multiple occasions walking down the street, the last of which cost him the use of his right arm permanently. A home invader waited for my mother to be home alone, kicked the door in, and sexually assaulted her. In a separate instance, she was shot in the face by an attacker (who turned out to be a felon, and could not legally obtain a gun, yet got ahold of one anyway) in her own living room. (She survived) I’ve had knives held to my throat more than once. I’ve been told I was about to die. I have not enjoyed the privilege of experiencing a world that I don’t feel the need to defend myself from. I understand how your experiences have not led you to the conclusion that you need a gun, but are you really that incapable of looking past your own narrow perspective? I don’t even get how this has even become a conservative vs. liberal issue. How is feeling that everyone deserves equal access to protection not a liberal idea? I know it’s easy to be a young kid, with no scars, and want to think people are good, so it must be the guns. At some point though, you need to understand that these are real situations, that people less fortunate than you have to face every day. Telling someone who has been repeatedly victimized, that they should not have the right to use equal or greater force to defend themselves from attack, is nothing short of cruelty. The ability to protect yourself exists, and the rich and unaffected don’t get to keep it from you, just because they don’t feel like they need it, so why should you?

That's heavily dependent on the country, even though an esprit de corps appears to be a serious problem in all countries alike, I give you that. (Which is also a reason why I think there should be a controlling agency for the police, where one can file complaints.)

Also... How else would you try to have laws enforced if not via police and a judicial system? By local militias?! That would just lead to arbitrary justice/lynch justice. (And those militias would be a de facto police again anyways.) I actually prefer a state of law. That is also the reason as to why I'm not an anarchist anymore but consider myself a statist socialist.

Some oppression is also good and necessary. A socialist system would be oppressive towards selfish egomaniacs who want to own and control the labour of other people afterall aswell. Likewise oppressing thiefs, murderers, rapists and the likes is also something which is justified, in my opinion. It all depends on which kind of people you try to oppress for which reasons. Arguing against oppression in general, especially as a socialist, is just harebrained.

And in how far is a police officers impact on the world necessarily negative?

To find out more about this kind of stuff, it’s probably best to read about various revolutionary societies - France of course, Russia, Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War, and modern-day Rojava 

All of those revolutionary societies were a product of different influences, so the ways they developed their institutions (like revolutionary militias) varied case by case."

So I don’t actually disagree with the concept of a state being a monopoly on violence/oppression/whatever itself. I’m pretty much a Marxist Leninist, so I do agree that some level of authoritarianism is required to get to an ideal socialist/communist society. It’s about whose interests that violence exists to serve.

Yea but police very rarely catch rapists or murderers, that isn’t even their job. They exist to protect capital, not people. They’ll send you right to jail if they see you damaging private property (which is not personal property), but as far as murderers and rapists go, that’s a tertiary concern for them, if they’re not the ones doing it themself.

>	Also... How else would you try to have laws enforced if not via police and a judicial system? By local militias?! That would just lead to arbitrary justice/lynch justice. (And those militias would be a de facto police again anyways.) 

I don’t pretend to have a perfect answer for this, someone does still needs to investigate acts of violence and respond appropriate, but what I do know is that if we lived in a world with zero police, that would be a far more peaceful world then what we have right now. It’s a proven fact that decreasing the policing in an area leads to a decrease in violence. People like to throw around the term ‘community policing,’ which I for one can never get a straight definition of what it actually is, but it seems like some model where citizens of an area can democratically elect and unelect people who actually live there to serve as law enforcement would go a long way. That and disarming police in general. But at the end of the day, it’s impossible to have a ‘good’ police force as long as it exists under a capitalist society."

That is just ideologically-blinded nonsense. Police exist to enforce the law. It depends on the laws which they enforce, what their function is. And since murder and rape are serious violations of the law, they will prosecute those, much like they will prosecute people damaging private property/engaging in vandalism. (And probably even more so the former, due to the higher seriousness, than the latter. What happened in Stuttgart on the last weekend in the night from 20.06. to 21.06.2020 clearly shows that vandalism and damaging of private property isn't as important for them as harming other people.)

>\[...\] but what I do know is that if we lived in a world with zero police, that would be a far more peaceful world then what we have right now.

I call bullshit on that claim. Just look at the Favelas in Brazil or other similar places. Police doesn't even really dare to enter these anymore. Sure, the various criminal organizations there are somewhat keeping peace and order, but they will also just straight up murder you. And I would guess that rapes and other crimes probably are more rampant there than in areas which the police properly guards. Or what about Afghanistan and other war zones without properly functioning police, where warlords are known to kidnap children and hold them as sex slaves?!

>It’s a proven fact that decreasing the policing in an area leads to a decrease in violence.

I seriously doubt that. I also couldn't find any proper proof of this in my, admittedly rather short, attempt at googling about this. (Unless of course it is gangs and other criminal organizations that start enforcing ""peace and order"", like in the aforementioned Favelas, in which case the enforcement methods in themselves certainly are far more violent though and the justice might be quite arbitrary.)

>People like to throw around the term ‘community policing,’ which I for one can never get a straight definition of what it actually is, but it seems like some model where citizens of an area can democratically elect and unelect people who actually live there to serve as law enforcement would go a long way.

As far as I'm aware, a lot of Sheriffs in the US actually do get voted into office and yet several of these elected Sheriffs are actually known for quite brutal and inhumane enforcement of the law, if they can be bothered to enforce the law at all. (And is it really that good of an idea to have the people in a relatively racist community vote for the law enforcement, which probably will turn out to also be a racist?!) Just look at Joe Arpaio for example.

>That and disarming police in general.

In the US? Sure... Police should be disarmed quite a bit more than it currently is and also demilitarized, as well as have more restrictions placed onto them in regards to the usage of firearms. I am not aware of the structure, but if it is not already practiced, splitting the police up into different roles could also help. Completely disarming them though would be stupid. Actual training and screening of police officers, instead of handing some racist maniac with a sadistic tendencies automatic rifles and a badge after just 21 weeks is far more important and effective."

7895,hfsz22,"You're most likely using it as the slogan against the institution itself, commenting on what you feel is institutional police brutality. I don't know how far down the rabbit hole you've gone, but you may think that police, as a ""system,"" is inherently violent and helps maintain control over the masses at the point of a gun held by the few in power, or those employed by the few in power. 

But, the phrase is in and of itself problematic, and here is why I think it's intellectually lazy. You are fighting against the idea that all people of a group share the same guilt of any actions of anyone within the group. Now, you're going to point out a distinction here (as pointed out elsewhere), that the mentality of what you are fighting against is based on how people are born (skin color, race, gender/gender identity) and not on people's behavior. And once you say that, I'll say that you are still ignoring the overwhelming majority of police officers who don't behave that way, don't accept others who behave that way, and legitimately just want to protect the general public. 

Further, the phrase in the past has been used by racist skinheads, and neo-nazis. Now this may also be an attempt by those on the left today to co-op or ""recapture"" the phrase and take it from one portion of its neo-nazi background, and basically turn it on its head to be used by those who consider themselves antifascists.

And instead of people looking at that reasonably and saying, “hey this needs some investigation to find out all the details,” you had riots and looting and burning.

7910,hfsz22,"So the way I see it there are only two logical explanations for why the Favelas are so dangerous. Either people are innately violent and will necessarily descend into chaos without a gun being trained on them. Or the conditions of global neoliberalism enable and actively encourage exploitive patterns of behavior. Personally, I believe humans are capable of being generally decent to one another without living under threat of violence, given a reasonable standard of living, most of us do it every day. In my mind, the second option, and I think you’d agree with me, is the more practical explanation. I do believe there are people that are more predisposed to violence the others, and need to be dealt with, but I don’t think that represents the average person. I think instead that many people are forced to become violent out of the conditions they are forced to live in.

I’m not here to defend gangs or ‘mob rule’ or whatever, but it’s pretty easy to see why they emerge when people are subjugated to such an extreme extent.

As you say, police exist to enforce the law, but the law exists primarily to define neoliberalism and not generally to protect people. Sure they may try and stop people from being shot in broad daylight right in front of them, but that’s a pretty low bar. And as the last few weeks have really illustrated, a lot of the time they’re the ones committing those acts of violence in the first place.

Eh, that’s why I said originally this is a much deeper conversation then I wanted to get into. I think for a lot of leftists it’s not so much we’re against the idea of the concept of state violence altogether, but state violence under capitalism exists to uphold an inherently exploitive system, and sometimes it happens to solve a murder or two. I don’t know if you’ve ever dealt with police but if you have it’s clear they don’t give a shit about you, they just want to make arrests."

The environmental protection laws he took away and the lying and hateful things he says. How can you support him if he does the complete opposite of what you claim you are, which is not hating anyone."
7912,hfsz22,"This wasnt horrendously incorrect or anything but you are still missing the point. the reason cops are bastards is not because of police brutality and them committing heinous acts of violence that go against the law. A cop who simply does their job will do things such as arresting people who get caught with weed on them, arresting homeless people for simply trying to survive, etc. Even stuff like arresting people for robbery (not that I agree with stealing from people obviously) will completely ruin someones life. These are people that have been wronged by capitalism because they are forced to do things like that simply to have a tolerable existence. 

A cop when they become a cop says they will carry out any violence necessary to enforce the law. They dont care what the law is, even if its a law that is super immoral to enforce (like the few I mentioned above, but there are other more specific examples that are even more horrific). Volunteering to do that and then actually carrying out means you are a dick. It doesnt mean you deserve to be burned at the stake, but it does mean that you are a bastard. 

Thats just the liberal reason for hating cops, now we can even get into the communist analysis for hating cops. Capitalism is enforced by the police, they exist to defend private property. If a corporation hordes means of production or supplies that people need to use to live, its the polices job to make sure those pieces of property stay in the hand of those who own them.

In the united states when you go to prison you are legally a slave. its not even a secret, its the reason that the CCA opposed weed legalization, they blatantly said if less people got arrested for weed they would have a smaller labor force. Almost every american corporation from disney to starbucks to mcdonalds uses slave labor. Guess whos job it is to catch these slaves?

And then you could also have a libertarian take on why cops are bad which is generally the logic used by the right. Cops exist to commit violence for the state. If the state needs someone put away or restrained the cops are the ones who do it. This is minor in comparison to the others I mentioned so I dont really elaborate."
7913,hfsz22,"another point - corruption within the police force. a majority of cops are aware of corruption when it goes down within their department. some of it im sure is pretty minor but it can be as extreme as cops that rape people in custody while others know about it. cops keep their mouth shut or guess what? they get fired. if you are a cop chances are you are aware of some corruption that you arent reporting. there are cops that report corruption and in my opinion I would say they arent bastards (unless they have done some of the other things ive listed) but those cops dont really stay cops. 

I would say that ""all cops are bastards"" is slightly wrong because there are some cops that are new to the force who havent had a chance to do anything bad yet. but in order to stay a cop for a reasonable amount of time you *have* to be a bastard

That is a false dichotomy. It is A PART of human nature to be violent or to ignore the harm one causes to others to enrich or satisfy oneself. This can already be observed in children and various other animals (also chimps and the likes), who haven't come into contact with our economical system in a way to be greatly influenced by it. To some degree the economical circumstances also play a role, but even without those circumstances you will still have a lot of people who commit crimes against each other. The problems and violence in the real world are based on far more than just the economical system. (Like a husband murdering/attacking the guy his wife had an affair with, someone who is just straight up jealous of something someone else has and either sabotages that someone else or straight up steals from him, a rapist that couldn't control his lust/desires \[also including ""to dominate others""\], a racer that tries to make the street his racing track and endangers others, a Nazi attacking a left-winger, a racist who has beaten up someone he is racist against, or people with personality disorders or psychological problems like antisocial people, psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists or psychotic people.) Sure, those aren't necessarily your ""average"" person, but taking all those problematic groups together, you probably get atleast 15-30% of the population, if not more. Even normal people are capable of stealing, severely speeding on the streets or harming others, in the right circumstances and with the right state of mind at that time, so the number probably would be even higher. Remember that it were mainly ""average"" people that supported the rise of the Nazis and didn't lean up against them even though they knew that there was shady shit going on.

And even if you were right with your assessment, fact of the matter is that we don't live in a society with basically no unfulfilled material needs and thus it would be foolish to argue that because in an ideal society where this would be the case police wouldn't be necessary, they aren't necessary at this moment aswell.

>\[...\] but the law exists primarily to define neoliberalism and not generally to protect people.

I don't agree with that. The law doesn't primarily exist to define neoliberalism. That is, again, just ideologically-blinded nonsense. It just so happens that neoliberal movements and politicians had a lot of influence over it. That's not the same as it's primary purpose though.

>Eh, that’s why I said originally this is a much deeper conversation then I wanted to get into. I think for a lot of leftists it’s not so much we’re against the idea of the concept of state violence altogether, but state violence under capitalism exists to uphold an inherently exploitive system, and sometimes it happens to solve a murder or two.

I am aware of that view among the (radical to extremist) left-wing. I used to be an anarchist with quite similar views to this myself. Nowadays, however, I disagree with that notion. To some degree it is true that state violence is used to uphold the capitalist system, but at the same time the state and laws also got influenced by various left-wing movements and their ideas, which atleast somewhat limit the problematic tendencies of capitalism, have been codified into law aswell and are equally enforced by the state. (i.e. the right to strike, unionize, have democratic representation in the business for the labourers and so on)

>I don’t know if you’ve ever dealt with police but if you have it’s clear they don’t give a shit about you, they just want to make arrests.

So on the one hand I had quite a lot of encounters with riot police on Antifa demonstrations. I only directly witnessed two occasions in which the police clearly misbehaved and escalated the situation. On the other hand, as a private person, I was smoking weed in front of a police station (while waiting at a bus station) and also passed police officers on the sidewalk with a joint that I tried to hide in my palm. Nothing happened and in the latter case the police officers even smiled at me and wished me a nice day, despite them obviously smelling and knowing about the joint. I also once suffered from a psychosis for several months (due to my cannabis usage) and, due to the paranoia I developed from the delusion of reference that I suffered from, started to threaten to harm myself and others. The police had to come for me twice, talking me down and bringing me to psychiatry, in one case even while I also threatened them! (He could've pressed charges against me, but decided not to.) I also have seen various other interactions with police happening throughout my life and I can clearly say, that they don't ""just want to make arrests"". The behaviour of the police also heavily depends on the system itself (i.e. the American one being far worse than the German one) and the individual officers.

Don't get me wrong though, I still see a lot of problems with the police, also here in Germany, but I think that one just can't have such a simple worldview like a lot of people here are showcasing. (""All cops are bastards"", ""They only exist to uphold capitalist oppression"", etc.)"

The postal service is almost universally liked by Americans, regardless of party affiliation, they have a ridiculous approval rating for government programs.

If you high-light specific groups or people, as you just did with Trump and Proud Boys, then it's accurate.

But making it a blanket is bad.

And just to be clear, I'm all-in on Antifa Skynet. I'm the person cheering for that to be a thing the most.

But making a blanket statement of ""If <rhetorical you> disagrees that <rhetorical someone(could technically be anyone)> is a fascist, chances are you're a fascist yourself"" ain't great.

Cops shooting peaceful protesters in the face with rubber bullets is a tragedy. It's also the reaction to protests against police brutality that best showcases why people are protesting in the first place.

8164,fnmqbb,"Fun fact: most (not all, and certainly not the current crash) economic cycles are driven by fluctuations in land prices and rents.

I know it's not truly leftist lit, but Henry George's [*Progress and Poverty*](http://www.henrygeorge.org/pcontents.htm) does a helluva job explaining how the ever-increasing rents and housing costs push people into having to cut their other spending, which results in ""relative overproduction"" in the rest of the economy (sounds familiar to what we learned about overproduction and speculation in the late 1920s).

If not for COVID-19 and it's economic repercussions, it was presumed that the next housing/rent bubble would burst around the year 2026, give or take a year.

8167,fnmqbb,"I told my mom last week that my wife and I had agreed three years ago not to sell our condo and buy a house until after the economy crashed, and then started to recover, and we were sure we could still afford it.  She was like ""that was so smart, how did you know?"".

I know nothing about economics, I just know that the capitalist system crashes about every 10 years.  That's all.  Regardless if you're a socialist or a capitalist, the economy crashes in a more or less ten year cycle.  We were overdue.  And it took a microscopic piece of fat and protein to trip it up this time."
8168,fnmqbb,"Yes, sure 

But this isn't antifascist unless we're declaring capitalism = fascism"
8169,fnmqbb,Socialism's failures have been at the hands of capitalist interference. Down with the rich! Down with Capitalism!

8177,fnmqbb,"Friendly reminder that Hitler started a massive wave of privatization, and greatly rewarded wealthy industrialists as part of the war effort, while sending labor organizers to the concentration camps.

Capitalism and fascism are bosom buddies, especially under the threat of capitalism faltering. As it was in the 1930's, when socialism was increasingly popular internationally, and the German government had a legit Communist party opposing the Nazis."
8178,fnmqbb,"yeah you are right. historically speaking, many fascists use the opportunity of capitalism crashing as a venue to bring about fascism and consolidate it.

i have no excuse, i just thought it was funny and wanted to share it"
8179,fnmqbb,Fascism is capitalism in decline. And most antifascists are anticapitalists as well
8180,fnmqbb,they come together more often than not. and fascism has always aligned with anti-communism

8191,fnmqbb,"There's no such thing as a fascist revolution, fascism is reactionary.  If you're talking about authcomm revolutions, I'm not a huge fan of them, but they're not fascist.  Fascism is how capitalists keep control in times of crisis by ramping up the blaming of poor people for their own poverty and pitting them against each other.  It's a very specific phenomenon.

As an anarchist, I don't agree with the take that M-L revolutions are somehow fascist.  Yes, they tend to be corrupted, but they are preferable to neoliberalism and enormously better than fascism."

8209,heii5s,"No offenses, but that’s why I will never get a visa. I don’t want to go to a country that opresses mine that only let me pass if I spend some dollars there.
In my country it is easier to pay for an agency to fill your form because as a single woman filling alone, they don’t accept because they think you are a prostitute wanting better life conditions. Why I will spend to go to a country that assumes that I am a prostitute terrorist because of my gender, my color, my nationality?"
8210,heii5s,You couldn't pay me enough to go to the USA. I'd feel safer in China.

8226,heii5s,[deleted]
8227,heii5s,there’s a couple pages of “security questions” where they basically ask you if you plan to commit crimes
8228,heii5s,"IIRC 'known anarchists' have been banned from entering the US since the early 20th century.

Edit : I did recall correctly!

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1903#:~:text=1222%2C%20into%20law%20on%20March,beggars%2C%20and%20importers%20of%20prostitutes."
8229,heii5s,It's not there so people answer yes. It's there so that if you come and commit terrorism they can deport you for lying on the form without needing to go through the hassle of a terrorism trial.
8230,heii5s,"There's a couple of pages filled with these dumb questions. I'm dumbfounded every time I fill it out, I really can't see the purpose of it."
8231,heii5s,"It was on my russian visa application too. The idea of asking stuff like “are you a terrorist” is that terror charges might not stick, but if it turns out you are a terrorist, they can charge you with obtaining the visa by fraud and easily deport you, as that’s an easier charge to make stick"
8232,heii5s,"They also (still) ask you if you have ever been a member of the communist party. Believe me, as a hard-left Irish Republican coming to the USA after marrying an American woman it NEVER occurred to me to tell those morons the truth about my political convictions. Back then (late 90s) that question struck me as a throwback to the McCarthy-era 50s. Now... we’re gripped by another red scare, lol. Fuck me."
8233,heii5s,A friend of my mums was filling out her form absentmindedly and accidentally ticked yes. Didn’t find out until she got the letter saying  it had been rejected
8234,heii5s,"The best question on that visa form was still: ""Do you plan to commit genocide during your stay in the USA?"""
8235,heii5s,Was wondering the same thing. Like who's just gonna be like yeah I'm tottaly gonna commit acts of terror if you let me come over.
8236,heii5s,"It is. Its only purpose is so that they can use it retroactively to revoke your green card or citizenship, or charge you with something: If you answer no and then the government later 'discovers' that you were, let's say, a member of Antifa then they can claim that you got your citizenship fraudulently and revoke it."
8237,heii5s,"Do you really want the U.S. to issue you a visa?  **yes**

Are you sure?  **yes**

Are you really, *really*, absolutely sure?  **yes**

Are you certain that you don't not want to not skip not being issued a visa to the U.S.?"
8238,heii5s,These questions are on more documents than you think.  I work at an airport and every employ that works on the secure side of the terminal (whether flipping burgers or fueling aircraft) has a bunch of these questions asked.
8239,heii5s,People who seek to engage in terrorist activities while in the United States or have ever engaged in terrorist activities
8240,heii5s,Yes. It is a question on the UK/EU visa waiver form that you fill in as you fly.

8243,heii5s,As someone who went to the US for tourism purposes just before trump announced his campaign for the presidency: yes
8244,heii5s,"If you choose yes, do you instantly get a job as a researcher for the US government?"
8245,heii5s,"Crossing the border from Canada and US used to have this question.

Do you, or have you consumed, distributed, or manufactured: marijuana, cocaine, heroin?

Guy I was working with put yes, as he has smoked weed before. He was banned entry for a decade because he's in the same category as a narcotics manufacturer.

Basically, the system wants you to lie to get in."
8246,heii5s,Not cartoonish. This is straight up real life villanry. We call it cartoonish so we dont get as depressed
8247,heii5s,"If I remember correctly, the initial proposition used ""antifa"" and ""left-wing activism"" interchangebly. So, yes, it's basically anyone more left than Trump."
8248,heii5s,Its real. As others have pointed out its a legal loophole to speed deportation if you're ever accused of terrorism.
8249,heii5s,"Well they did ask me if I plan to commit genocide, so this was one of the more reasonable questions on that test"
8250,heii5s,lmao it is

8255,heii5s,"Getting a security license has a question that is something like ""Do you fantasize about being the Angel of Death or that such an angel is speaking to you?"". Or at least they did a decade ago."
8256,heii5s,"I was told a story that when Oscar Wilde came to visit America, he looked at the form where it said “Do you intend to overthrow the government of the United States by force?” and neatly wrote in “Sole purpose of visit”."

8258,heii5s,Most famously Emma Goldman.
8259,heii5s,Welp
8260,heii5s,But how do they conclude that you committed terrorism without a trial?
8261,heii5s,[deleted]
8262,heii5s,I thought there pops out a place to write down about it in detail. Probably not for terrorism though lol. I’ve read that there was a mexican guy who smoked a joint in his 20s and was applying for greencard after 10 or so years. Apparently he checked out yes in there to be honest and got rejected for gc. It seems immigration guys want to get the paperwork straight rather than honesty

8277,heii5s,"Immigration law doesn't carry the same burden of proof. The state can set the requirements for a visa, and it can also decide wether you meet them."
8278,heii5s,"shh... don't think about it, that's terrorism pal"
8279,heii5s,They could discover connections to terrorist organizations abroad through the investigation. There’s a good amount of old IRA members who would have to answer yes to that question but aren’t wanted anymore.

It's not because they hate sharks, they just don't care. The real reason is because it's a kickback to the fishing industry in return for campaign donations. Sharks are predators so they compete with us for fish, and the sharks themselves can be harvested during the cull.

8329,hg8ch8,What is it about jerking off to cartoons that makes one prone to far-right ideology?
8330,hg8ch8,"I want to believe that this is a sweet old woman who is a wonderful teacher whose rascal grandson took her out for a nice, quiet birthday dinner the previous night and then they had a crazy night trying to run away from people who were trying to kill them, and the grandson is in another room holding nazi biker gangsters at gunpoint while the grandma lovingly teaches her class from the only computer she has access to. I would pay to watch that movie.

In reality, she's probably just a racist old grandma."
8331,hg8ch8,"guys, nsfw"
8332,hg8ch8,I do Nazi anything amiss here
8333,hg8ch8,He probably took this https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackLivesMatter/comments/hfgdmr/couldnt_be_more_true/ post to heart.

8338,hg8ch8,With there logic me supporting ISIS is just me being a proud Muslim
8339,hg8ch8,Do the furries have a fucking nazi problem?
8340,hg8ch8,"I love when we can talk shit about nazid without it being just ""HAHAnazi fat missing teeths and bald arent all those people the same"""
8341,hg8ch8,"Is it just me, or does the alt-right have a furry thing going on?"

8343,hg8ch8,"Oh yeah don't go harassing that Vince guy, he's not a Nazi, he's just kind of a fucking idiot."
8344,hg8ch8,FUCK her heritage
8345,hg8ch8,Interesting to know that other countries seem to have their own versions of our “muh heritage” neo-confederates.
8346,hg8ch8,"As if the Swastika flag isn't bad enough, having a flag with the Death's Head insignia on it too?"
8347,hg8ch8,"Sure Vince, sure."
8348,hg8ch8,Vince is a moron.
8349,hg8ch8,Classic nazillians

8353,hg8ch8,The gay furry defending a Nazi
8354,hg8ch8,Please tell me she was fired
8355,hg8ch8,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion, I don't care. If those are original flags, like actually used in WW2, then they almost certainly were taken by an Allied soldier as war memoribilia. Lots of soldiers did this as conquerors. There's a sort of power in taking your enemies artifacts.

My grandpa kept a copy of Mein Kampf that he took off a German soldier he killed during that war. Many other people have taken pistols, knives, ribbons, buttons. Little proofs that they in fact killed a Nazi.

And as a descendant of those soldiers, many people keep those artifacts as proof their father fought in the war and killed nazis, and are in that sense proud to possess those artifacts. That copy of Mein Kampf stayed in our family for at least 2 generations. Last I knew one of the cousins had it, don't know if they still do.

So anyway, somebody openly displaying something like that in their home, if they've *never* shown a tendency towards those beliefs before, I'm gonna be wary but give them the benefit of the doubt until I ask (which I would absolutely do, you can't *not* address the Nazi flag in the room)."
8356,hg8ch8,"Nazi paraphernalia = nazi.
That said, not all ""swastikas"" are swastikas. Latvians used to use them all the time to symbolize different things (strength, or courage, or fertility, stuff like that). I'm not so sure if Latvians use that particular symbol anymore due to the public viewing it as the swastika, I'd have to ask some family members."
8357,hg8ch8,"Man first I thought that was a joke, but according to their Twitter it's pure ignorance. 

There's something really annoying about someone writing ""it's most likely this and that"" when they're obviously wrong."
8358,hg8ch8,Why are furries so fucking rabid
8359,hg8ch8,Nazi furries are the cringiest type of furry.
8360,hg8ch8,"I wonder how many wannabe nazis realize that if alt right comes into power, millions of fake nazis will join and make life a living hell for actual bigots. Fascism and bigotry is a joke and it turns on everyone involved EVER SO EASILY - because there is no sense to it. And in a system without rules that make sense, everyone can be a victim.

Americans aren't shit, we're awesome. There's just the bottom end of the curve that needs serious help. And if violent, well, then there's consequences."
8361,hg8ch8,"as a furry, why are furries like this?"
8362,hg8ch8,[deleted]
8363,hg8ch8,Gay Nazi furries are fucking wild
8364,hg8ch8,"It consistently amazes me how many Nazi furries there are. Like... You know these people want you dead, right?"
8365,hg8ch8,It was ironic and alluding towards the southern heritage crap
8366,hg8ch8,Or substitute the swastika with the iron cross. I was stunned when i learned that they openly display and sell flags with those cheap look alikes which are clearly supposed to resemble nazi symbols at funfairs.
8367,hg8ch8,At least it used to be like that until we went full Murica with the flag-presence after 2006
8368,hg8ch8,God I wish they knew Frederick the Great was a raging homosexual
8369,hg8ch8,Sounds just like republicans in the USA.
8370,hg8ch8,"This is why some bemused Americans sometimes spot the Confederate flag flying in Germany.  It's basically, to German neo-Nazis, a legal substitute for the swastika flag."
8371,hg8ch8,oh so they're like people in England with the English flag?
8372,hg8ch8,Or they’re a first generation immigrant. We’re except from this rule and somehow insist on flying the German flag.
8373,hg8ch8,"Even more obvious alternatives are flying the [German Empire flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_flags#German_Empire_(1871%E2%80%931918\)) (Which, admittedly, does look pretty nice from a purely aesthetic standpoint, but has terrible connotations) or a [Nordic cross german flag](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_von_Flaggen_mit_skandinavischem_Kreuz#Deutsche_Flaggen) (Which is really ironic, since it was first used by the 20 July plotters)"
8374,hg8ch8,"Also, no German person who has any appreciation for the culture or history of Germany hangs up a fucking swastika flag. It's almost universally seen among non-fascists as a symbol of destruction and shame.

I didn't even grow up there, and just having my german relatives around instilled a very visceral reaction to it. It just makes me deeply uncomfortable to be around nazi paraphernalia outside of museums. Its similar in austria, where I live now - nobody would hang a nazi flag in their sitting room...but they will still vote for the FPÖ 😂"
8375,hg8ch8,I mean it's not anywhere near as extreme but an English flag in Britain is never a good sign.
8376,hg8ch8,"Completely true. I have a german flag hanging in my room but thats onky because I live abroad and its just a thing to connect me with my homeland, I dont value it much more than that. If I was back home in Germany I dont think Id feel the urge to have one at all, its just so weird and unnecessary."
8377,hg8ch8,One of the weirder things with America is its kinda getting like that over here now.
8378,hg8ch8,Fuck rot-weiβ-schwarz
8379,hg8ch8,"Yeah, as an American living in a nationalist country where half the population has 'murka flags on their underwear it was pretty mind-blowing to learn that most Germans have about as much regard for the German flag as Americans have for the postal service. As it should be in any sane country.

Sorry you all have to see this, it's not our best moment."
8380,hg8ch8,And the  right wingers play victim when their “love for their country” is seen as a dog whistle by the rest of Germany lol
8381,hg8ch8,"That’s like here in the UK, if you fly a british flag and there isn’t a sporting event going on, you’re either a UKIP member or part of the EDL"
8382,hg8ch8,I swear that in Canada you have something similar so they fly the Confederate flag.
8383,hg8ch8,"Same in most European countries, such as the UK I find"
8384,hg8ch8,At least Germans seem to have some shame for their history. Can't say the same for other countries that have committed genocide.
8385,hg8ch8,"Ya that’s a totenkopf SS Division flag, they were the worst of the absolute worst."

8387,hg8ch8,But...b-but it's i-ironic..!!!!
8388,hg8ch8,If only Americans called people who wave the confederate flag Traitors.

8390,hg8ch8,Hey Mika
8391,hg8ch8,It’s literally the flag of fascism dude
8392,hg8ch8,"Im Dutch/British. Colonizing distant lands, stealing their stuff and enslaving the people is my heritage. 

And I deal with that by, get this, NOT doing that. I have zero East India Company flags. Its very very easy."
8393,hg8ch8,"I've seen some discussions of how dogs and canine creatures are considered ""masculine"", whilst feline creatures are ""feminine"", so maybe the overlap somehow goes over to white men who are also furries who /also/ happen to be nazis? I feel like I'm 12 again reading fanfics. I could throw a dart at an idea now and it'd probably be true at this point. 

I have to think most furry-types are roiling over this, though. They get shitty press as is lol"
8394,hg8ch8,"Certain canine species like gsheps or dobermen have a baffling number of Nazi defenders (if not outright Nazis themselves)

Sergals also got utterly ruined by Nazi filth. Poor things"
8395,hg8ch8,Because he's gaslighting.
8396,hg8ch8,Because there's a huge fucking swastika on it. Also all three flags in the picture are german flags.

The furry responding is 100% american and doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. Or maybe he is actually making fun of people flying confederates flags and the joke went over everyone's head. Either way, no one in germany flies nazi flags, except for actual nazis."

8414,hg8ch8,"Yeah. As a furry, It's really annoying having actual fucking nazis be an ugly, noticeable part of an otherwise pretty decent community."
8415,hg8ch8,Yeah I once went down that rabbit hole when reading up on all the furry Nazi art on some of those sites.  Wild shit.
8416,hg8ch8,Which is dumb because they still use that cross.
8417,hg8ch8,"Look at Höcke at Lanz, that would be perfectly normal in the US but extremely weird here. Or Merkel taking away the little German flags at some party-party"

8420,hg8ch8,He also was opposed to death penalty/execution preferred the arts to warfare and was huge advocate for ethnic minorities.
8421,hg8ch8,Seems like an infatuation with your flag is a pretty good indication that someone might be a nationalist piece of shit.
8422,hg8ch8,nationalists
8423,hg8ch8,Pretty much
8424,hg8ch8,I troll Confederate flag wielders in the states with a Union Jack.
8425,hg8ch8,same my father has the german flag up in his living room because he was born there and we live in Australia
8426,hg8ch8,"I dont know if I'd describe it as shame, because on a personal level nobody feels guilty. But it's more like a secondhand embarrassment and cringe, especially when people repeat the behaviour in a modern context. It's not cool, it's not funny, it's a blight and a tarnish that terrifies people of the idea of it happening again."
8427,hg8ch8,If you live in Europe (or almost anywhere on Earth) you know what the Nazi flag is.
8428,hg8ch8,You are literally the guy in the picture lmao

Nein, das sind nur ""besorgte Bürger""."
8432,hg8ch8,Unfortunately it's just one of the flags of fascism and the list keeps growing.
8433,hg8ch8,"It's ironic because canines tend to have significantly stronger social bonds and care about the other members of their pack, most for the weaker ones. Especially wolves and African wilddoogs. The later go hunting by voting with sneezes. I have jokingly compared them to proto communists... Felidae may also have in some cases (lions eg) but are mostly solitary animals."
8434,hg8ch8,"That might be true! Also checks out with the fact that people with the most toxic icons tend to be like, moe anime cat girls..."
8435,hg8ch8,"I get the correlation, because gsheps and dobermen are both common guard/police dogs. 

I have no idea what a Sergal is, and at this point I’m too afraid to ask."

8439,hg8ch8,That’s comforting that it’s not widespread. Still sucks that I’m deep in confederate country :/

8442,hg8ch8,Bruh
8443,hg8ch8,"I doubt his name was Oskar Schindler...

8444,hg8ch8,"Ahhhh, good ol' homonationalism. I have a former friend who legit wanted to establish a gay ethnostate with bi's as breeders. He's in the Marines now."
8445,hg8ch8,"I don't think it's ""dumb"". If you replace the swastika under the reichsadler with a legal symbol, which has also a problematic history, everyone knows what's up but it's legal. A dogwhistle in form of a flag i would call it."
8446,hg8ch8,"In the military, which is mostly nazis so what's the problem here?"

But yeah, outside of a context like this, waving flags sets off alarm bells over here. You simply don't see German flags on cars for example."
8467,hg8ch8,Oh absolutely. IIRC he didnt abolish executions until he was on his deathbed but while he was in power he ensured that people died humanely and the displays of execution were typically after the condemned were dead. I think he did a lot during his twilight years when the political ramifications didnt matter.

It's still trolling guys claiming heritage by waving a flag that isn't a state flag or a US flag."

Yes, Africa was raped as a continent for their resources. It’s even hard to read about that period of history sometimes, knowing when was really going on behind the pages. 

Then even hundreds of years later when countries like the US had a chance to do right by the people’s ancestors whom they called their property, they drove them further into poverty, and set them up with obvious disadvantages to everyone else in society. (harder for African Americans to get good mortgages, etc)

But I’m sorry his numbers are wrong, over 400 years of slavery? Try all of human history. Maybe around 350 specifically for African Americans, but not half a millennium."

It’s disgusting the level of apathy people have, and that so many don’t even want to do the bare minimum. Forget about the bigots, the real problem is the multitudes who don’t even want to lift a finger to make someone’s life 1000 times better relatively easily."

American President was African American. Most of the sports stars are African American millionaires. A lot of successful African Americans in ever field. At this point it's just an excuse.

8560,g8g5uo,"You can't just hold up a few examples where black people do well and say ""there isn't a problem"". Sports is a way out of poverty for some black kids, but literally the few hundred that compete at a high level. That's nothing.

The thing you seem to ignoring is the ghetto type places where you're as likely to die from gunshot as heart attack, where there's a good desert so all anyone eats is fast food. Gangs are the only way to feel a sense of community and the entire community is looked down on and abused by the police. These places exist, and they exist for black people a lot more than white.

Plus, white people have a bunch of inhereted wealth that black people do not have because they've only been seen as equals for the past 60 years, not enough time to build up huge generation spanning capitalist empires. 

You might not think you're privileged and maybe you had a shitty upbringing in Buttfuck, Texas with meth addict parents, but generally being white (and male) opens doors that don't even exist for black people unless they're the right kind of black person, willing to fit themselves into the white version of what a ""good"" black person should be."
8561,g8g5uo,"Yeah you're Indian that means you're incapable of being racist, right? It's not like Modi exists.

If racism is suddenly over just because a handful out of tens of millions of black people managed to break through the mold, it means racism is over.

Now let's disregard the wildly disproportionate police homicide rates when comparing black people to white people.

And their homelessness rate.

And poverty rate.

And pregnancy mortality rate.

And racial violence rate.

And how predominantly black communities are suffering a whole host of racially charged challenges like gentrification, under-funding of public services as well as housing discrimination.

Don't worry though this Indian guy says racism isn't real anymore, **we did it Reddit!**"

8568,g8g5uo,I recently saw a man being interviewed. He was a sharecropper from Mississippi. He still lived on his ancestors slave owners land. You could tell he lived in fear of poor treatment of the land and former slave owners. During the interview he would periodically look back to see if no one was listening. It really looked like the guy lived in accute PTSD. For this man I would say he lived through it.
8569,g8g5uo,"No but they are still feeling the repercussions of slavery.

My mother was raped when she was young and developed an eating disorder as a response to these events.

It was before I was born but I am still feeling the repercussions when I see my mother being intimidated by men and when she doesn't want to eat because she feels she's put on too much weight despite the fact she's slightly underweight.

It's a similar framework, yes I wasn't there when it happened but I am subject to the enduring effect of a traumatic incident like that."

I'm white btw, but white people really need to get over themselves. There's virtually no risk that this type of ""anti-white rhetoric"" is actually going to have any kind of serious repercussions for white people, the scale is tipped far too far the other way for that. Nobody think it's ""academic critique"" either. Often it's just people venting frustrations with people that are so clearly completely and utterly out of touch with their struggles, or simply a reminder of just how out of touch they are. At _worst_ it's a genuine bitterness directed at people who _constantly_ trivialise and even exacerbate their struggles because of how out of touch they are - but really, who can blame anyone for being bitter about that? Like are you gonna start complaining when someone makes a joke about people's ""middle class takes"" that trivialise the struggles of the working class?"
8579,g8g5uo,which ones were subjected to chattel and are still treated like shit today?
8580,g8g5uo,"People of all kinds were enslaved back in the day. Vikings had slaves, Britons had slaved, Saracens had slaves, Franks had slaves, Mayans had slaves. That's not the point. The difference here is magnitude and method. Most of the slaves in antiquity and medieval age were prisoners of war, they were conquered, not I'm not about to be jingoist and proclaim ""might is right"" but that was *their* stance. However you cannot enslave entire nations.

That's where colonialist slavery was very different, it was a prolonged effort that took place for centuries where global nations systemically and brutally dismantled entire nations, stripped the of ancestral context, wiped the nations off the face of the Earth and shipped those people around the world by the boatload to enslave them.

Slavery has always been a thing, in fact it still is, but it's clear that colonialist slavery was of a whole different caliber."

8598,g8g5uo,"I... So you think everyone should've just died instead of being enslaved? Should have sacrificed their families lives? I... I don't think you understand the way people are broken down to the point where they are mentally reduced to cattle in terms of obedience as slaves. There are a million ways to make someone so exactly what you want by force, and the will to live is huge and very hard to override, especially if you have loved ones involved. Also how do you organise a protest when any whisper of such will get beatings and murders in response? Please, go read a book on how slaves were actually treated and controlled and then get back to me with an informed opinion.

Additionally, the pure number of enslaved people made Trans-Atlantic slavery unique up until this point. (Most scholar agree on the estimate of 12 million Africans)

And let’s nor forget the violence perpetrated by White Supremacists, there have been more than 30 or so car attacks this year. The Nazis celebrate one of their own that goes out and kills 2 people. So please go on about “property damage” and “violence” because the only people doing that is Police and right wingers.

Yes, at this point, all right wingers are white supremacists. And all Cops are white supremacists, including Black cops."

8687,j5myrg,Yes that is what I just said.

They call anyone who does so the bad word. It was commie or faggot. Now it's antifa. 

They are a simple and utterly brain damaged people.

They also have violent terrorist organizations happily within their ranks."
8689,j5myrg,"My hope is that indeed AOC was just misinformed, being in the middle of the Washington DC politic class might not be the best place to learn about international politics. The USA really need politicians that are at least trying to improve things instead of just serving their corporate donors.

And yes Pelosi is a ghoul that has been serving as a shield for republican (and ""centrist"" democrats) corruption for decades, I remember, providing empty gestures to ""appease the masses"" when hard action was required."
8690,j5myrg,"Liberals have completly controlled the government at the local level for decades in most of the places with the worst police and even places with pretty bad right wing paramilitary presence, like Portland. What exactly are they waiting on to legislate change?"
8691,j5myrg,"""The violence of the left"" is more than warranted. We should be fucking rioting. We should be burning shit down. We should have dragged the president out of the white house by his feet with him kicking and screaming and we  should have strung him up for treason as an example to any other would be American fascist dictators.

All of this is warrented. Our democratic apparatus has been completely corrupted. It has failed the people. The government is not for the people. The people need to take back what is theirs if they ever want it back."

8696,j5myrg,"I concur. I was just making the point that he pretends to be a liberal when it suits him. I don't think he's actually liberal OR conservative. He's just Pro-Trump, Pro-Ego, and Pro-Power. You can't even say he has conservative values when he, in fact, has NO values. Sadly conservatives have lost their way in his wake. There is no way they even recognize their own party."

8702,j5myrg,"Yeah but you can do that through a ballot box. Take a look at most revolutions inside major powers and how they go. Now you might have your little people's war where you get to kill a few fascists and start an insurgency while the average citizen gets fucked as world powers carve us up like they did France, or Syria. Violence is a last resort because when it's used and the government loses stability, we have foreign actors who would jump at the chance for land grabs."

It's not that the right wing paramilitaries are never mentioned, the conversations aren't being had. Liberals are more concerned with urgent threats, i.e proud boys, kkk, and patriot front."
8706,j5myrg,yes.
8707,j5myrg,"> He's just Pro-Trump, Pro-Ego, and Pro-Power. 

Selfishness, self-centered, grandstanding being the ""strongest"" at all times, loves authoritarianism... how is he not Conservative?"
8708,j5myrg,"Good point, he doesnt seem like the type to stick his nose in other people's crap like America does. The double standards are outrageous, a revolt occurs anywhere else in the world and its ""freedom fighters,"" but if one happens here, then the same people who laud protestors abroad turn around and whine about ""looters thugs antifa small bussiness riots bla bla bla"". I know Im preaching to the choir here a bit on that last point, but it still stands. Color revoltuions for anywhere not yet in America's grasp, and the opposite, intense repression of protestors, for those already within the Empire."
8709,j5myrg,"How the fuck do you think you would react when there's no justice? There's never any fucking justice, you bootlicker."
8710,j5myrg,"Sorry, but the rationale not only makes sense, it has a proven track record of success. Most social movements don't get taken seriously until there is some material damage, and this includes many famous ""nonviolent"" movements like the Civil Rights Movement in the US and the Indian Independence Movement. The ruling class only accepts change when they are made to feel uncomfortable. Then usually they capitulate to the less extreme nonviolent branch of the movement and whitewash the violent bits and call the matter solved."
8711,j5myrg,You are one naive motherfucker if you believe this election isn't going to be stolen by trump. The days of fair elections are gone.
8712,j5myrg,"france never got carved up though, even during the french revolution their territorial integrity was respected"
8713,j5myrg,Everyone has a state. Doesn’t mean they are all equally evil for that. Each one must be judged on its own vices and virtues.
8714,j5myrg,"Wait until you hear about how at the peak of the gulag, they had only a slightly higher incarceration rate than the current US incarceration rate. You'll be even more surprised to find out that most prisoners were actual criminals, and political dissidents made up only a small portion of inmates (unlike in the US - every drug crime is a political crime remember). 

Additionally, gulag laborers were paid a wage higher than current inmates in the US. The gulag laborers also had a max sentence of 10 years."
8715,j5myrg,"That makes sense. Some people do know about FARC though. I had a Latino teacher who was a liberal talked  about how FARC was extremely dangerous, yet completely ignored the government and paramilitaries, and I’ve had similar experiences with liberals who know of FARC. I’d also like to mention that liberals tend to disavow violence overall when violence is sometimes necessary. The Black Panther Party was (and sometimes still is) dismissed as violent and terrorist, similar to how we are. Liberals do not align with us, we are considered terroristic and barbaric."
8716,j5myrg,I'm not sure. But I can tell you I definitely would not attack some random person or the business they built! That is just fucking illogical. And honestly a childish way thinking. Thats like a kid burning down the ice cream truck because some random other kid stole their pushpop!!
8717,j5myrg,This is the right take. Non-violent movements don’t succeed until there is a threat of violence.
8718,j5myrg,"Bruh, it's pretty easy to stop him. He's gonna try to take it to the courts (which is why he wants a 9th justice) and to stop her confirmation, all the Democrats need to do is to start impeachment proceedings on someone like let's say Bill Barr for ordering federal troops to attack peaceful protestors. Impeachment proceedings trump everything, and until they're complete, no other proceedings can occur (like a justice being confirmed) that way he won't be able to take it to the courts."
8719,j5myrg,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars
8720,j5myrg,Then I'd argue that states like the USSR and China were worse than the USA. None were without great sin.
8721,j5myrg,"I'm sure they were paid more than us prisoners, being forced to work for 14 hours, in horrible weather. Many died of exhaustion, starvation, or just got executed. If you couldn't meet your work quota, you got less food. Prisoners would fight over food and supplies, and conditions were unsanitary and unkempt. It was fucking hell. I'm not going to sing the praises of the U.S prison system, it's dogshit and needs a lot of reform, private prisons need abolishing, etc. But the horrors of Soviet gulags vastly eclipse that of the U.S incarceration system."
8722,j5myrg,"Idk, I've seen Malcolm X being posted on liberal subs before. And I don't think there's anything wrong with disavowing violence. People shouldn't be forced to go out and do something they're morally against. While plenty of liberals are fine with violence or war to fight Fascism (i.e iron front or FDR a Social Liberal), some people prefer non violence. While I'm all for decking some Richard Spencer twat at a counterprotest, I can understand anyone who would prefer not to do violence."

I'm sure when they threw weapons of war at you, and told you to sit down and shut the fuck up, I'm sure you would say 'yessir' and sit down. I'm sure that if somebody spilled all of your blood, the people who love you right now would be content with the KNOWLEDGE that the murderer might lose their piggy little job, if ANYTHING AT ALL happened.

The conditions you claim existed did, in fact, exist at one point during and shortly following ww2, but the entire country was suffering then.

8736,j5myrg,"Should I mention how female prisoners were treated? There was little gender segregation, so they were commonly sexually assaulted and rapes, their best solution was to make a prison husband who they would give sexual favors to in exchange for protection and rations. Any children they did have would usually be taken and sent to an orphanage, and reunions were rare. I could go on and on about other atrocities just under Stalin alone. The USSRs legacy was horrific. Anyone, regardless of political beliefs can criticized the Soviet Union for its numerous failings. It later fell apart under its own weight, leaving a corrupt mafia state run by members of the former government and crime families. If I were you I'd leave the vodka behind, tankie. I'll probably be a leftist, and you'll probably never be a liberal, but be an ancom or something. Don't waste your time defending the Soviet Union."

This really just is the political version of ""you're not a real _______ fan, you only liked them when they got popular"". Equal individual liberties for all is a liberal idea as well as a leftist one. I can support figures who embody fighting white supremacy and fascism while still being a liberal. People I look up to don't have to be of my exact political philosophy. I can support Mandela and not be a Socialist, because his ideas of racial equality transcend ideological barriers and isn't mutually exclusive to any ideology. Same thing with MLK, while he remained politically unaffiliated (though if you said he was some kind of leftist I probably wouldn't fight you on it) I can still agree with his ideas of racial equality, peaceful protest, and non violence, informed by both Christ and Gandhi. Just because a political figure held certain beliefs doesn't mean their supporters have to hold to their exact political philosophy. Politics isn't some gatekeepy fan club."

I'm not interested in some liberal who's literally just going to put a smiling old rapist face on the status quo. I wanna see real change for the working people, so I am not going to give any support to the political parties of the rich and powerful.

edit: I didn't even see this was in a left subreddit so I'm gonna cut the baby language. If you're voting Biden you have no political principles, you're ideologically bankrupt. From now to the end of time the argument of the lesser of two evils will hold true. Reagan was an evil bastard who hunted down communists, subverted democracies across the world, and helped pass racist legislation. Clinton was the same, Bush was the same, Obama was the same, and Biden has shown to be nothing but the same. Start supporting worker's movements or get out of the left imo."

edit: Didn't see this was in a leftist sub so I don't know why you liberals are out here advocating Biden.

8900,i134tf,"Having them arrested when they commit assault, vandalism, and arson."
8901,i134tf,"very true. 

We need to understand what humans are, and what instincts are engaged by ideologies....generally.  

Any ideology for social order is equivalent to group instructions for how to manage instincts in relation to society. 

A fascist ideology engages the most base human instincts. A fascist ideology makes the rest of humanity the enemy of the in-group.

There have been and are other sorts of ideologies that essential teach the same corrupt and violent instructions for instincts, whereas fascists ideologies are formed strictly to function under capitalism.

Leftists should remember that we firstly need to know the boundaries of morally and immorality that are general to all humanity, so we can evaluate our political fate within a knowledgeable perspective of humanity itself. 

This, this, this, and this: [Moral Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development)"

Because their belief-system are built entirely from logical fallacies, they can't know anything about reality. 

They don't know what morality is. Libertarians have the moral character of reptiles, and all they know about the world is from the view of reptiles. 

They don't understand why good people should even exist. 

Don't ever let them frame reality for you. 

---------


Libertarians are the most deluded and ignorant working-class people on planet earth right.

They are the fascist enemies with the USA...while polluting the worldviews of the most credulous of leftists and liberals. 

They live in a completely fabricated nonsense reality. If you take them at face value...them you can't understand anything about anything either. 

**Logic: if your initial premises are wrong, you can only come to false and bad conclusions**

The initial premises libertarians use to understand humanity are false, so they can never come to a rational conclusion. 

They don't know anything. If one believe libertarians have something right, then that person also doesn't know anything about humanity.

All libertarian ideas create the perception that humans are violent animals with no moral compass. 

If you believe anything a libertarians says is true, you are a libertarian...in the sense you share the same corrupted view of humanity. 

Think it over."
8904,i134tf,Interesting... No actual response to that.
8905,i134tf,"i agree with all of your points except for the first one. i dont think i can explain this perfectly so ill just copy paste some text from someone who studies this  [source](https://theconversation.com/how-to-talk-someone-out-of-a-damaging-cult-68930)

The first thing to realise is that people in cults are not crazy but are the same intelligent, creative and interesting individuals they were before. As with falling in love they are just crazy about the group, its amazing leader and its great potential to change the world and them with it. So the ideals of the group are probably quite attractive superficially – ending war and poverty, say, or promoting the healthy development of brain and body. After all, you don’t see many adverts saying “join this damaging cult that will destroy your life”.

Your friend or loved one has probably fallen hook line and sinker for the positive message of the group and their whole identity is now focused on this message. The key thing to remember is that criticising the group, however strange or damaging it seems to you, is the same as criticising your friend or family member themselves. They love the group really deeply – for all intents and purposes, they are the group.

Think back to when you fell in love for the first time and got those disapproving looks or critical comments from your parents or friends. Remember how angry that made you feel? And how determined you were to love the person all the more.

The most important piece of advice is to not criticise, condemn or judge, even if you have serious concerns. Instead, focus on why this person identifies with the group so much, and what they believe they are getting from it. And try to reinforce the message: “It’s great that you’re developing yourself and your skills so positively and that the group is making you so happy.”

It may feel cheesy, but the point of this approach is to draw on the psychological technique of motivational interviewing, so that these positive statements, similar to those the person has made themselves, will eventually lead them to question whether they are really true – we call this the “strategic and personal oriented dialogue” approach. This means you have to keep talking. Keep the dialogue going and help your loved one measure the group against their own hopes and standards. In time, the scales will start to fall from their eyes, and you can be ready for that moment."
8906,i134tf,Anyone who thinks Trump is a fascist has no idea what fascism is. How many articles about how evil and terrible Trump is did you upvote today? Sounds oppressive.

8908,i134tf,"Mate we don't really get liberals here, so im probably more left wing then them, but who tf r u voting for?"
8909,i134tf,"Absolutely. 

I feel like there are some aspects of individual psychology that predispose certain people toward things like alt-right rhetoric. Funny enough, for all the talk of ""fAcTs AnD lOgIc,"" it strikes me as very emotionally driven at its core."
8910,i134tf,That's a lot of hate for a group of people
8911,i134tf,"Thanks for sharing, those were my experiences though. I genuinely tried to understand where those people were coming from, listen to their concerns and I tried to avoid criticizing the people they followed. If someone isn't willing to listen to anything you say regardless of what you say because they think you're a part of a marxist conspiracy, it can be hard to get through to them. I'm not saying people shouldn't try, but these things don't always have a simple solution. That said, if any of those friends ever approached me to tell me they felt disillusioned or used by the movement they bought into, I wouldn't turn them away. At this point that's really all I can do. I've stopped talking to many of them because they were extremely toxic people."

8914,i134tf,"What are you on about, you don't get liberals in the UK? Are you sure about that? Because given that the UK is capitalist, all your ruling parties (and I'd argue at this point labour included) are liberal parties.

The answer is that I am not voting for bourgeois-liberal political parties at all. I put my political power towards only worker's groups and worker's parties."
8915,i134tf,"It's all in the relationship between self-identity and worldview.

I strongly suggest reading as much as you can stand to read about this concept: https://www.simplypsychology.org/kohlberg.html

There' a real stark difference and divide between those who see the world as always violent and those who have developed to high moral stages.

Nearly all left-wing ideologies are as [morally relativist](https://www.frontiernet.net/~kenc/law.htm) as right-wing ideologies. 

Only those on the highest stages of moral development will say that moral relativists are equivalent, regardless of their political label.

If you see the world as everyone making up their own rules for morality, you can't imagine it will every be better. The bulk of left and right ideologies portray humanity as unchanging, in the context of morality being whatever anything happens to think it is. 

To a moral lawyer, all ideologies look the same if they are morally relativist. 

Social science says we should only expect 10% of the population to understand a universal concept morality.. 

Examples: 

> “I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I'm a human being, first and foremost, and as such I'm for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.”― Malcolm X""  

>“Cowardice asks the question, 'Is it safe?' Expediency asks the question, 'Is it politic?' Vanity asks the question, 'Is it popular?' But, conscience asks the question, 'Is it right?' And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because one's conscience tells one that it is right” ― Martin Luther King Jr.

A left-wing that is morally relativist does attack the right, it compliments it. 

Read about stage six of the development model in relation to the concept of natural law. 

I suggest those because they were revelations for me."
8916,i134tf,i get it man it’s really tough. i just have a lot of optimism that people can change if given the right opportunity. maybe that’s foolish but the alternative is to give up millions of people to facism and i can’t accept that without some kind of a fight. and hey this approach seems new to me so maybe there are other options for showing people there mistakes then you may have previously realized

8957,ijcztm,this gave me a boner...
8958,ijcztm,I genuinly don't understand the hate for non bigot cops who are just doing there job and I genuinely want to understand.
8959,ijcztm,RIP Britain for real our nation is so scuffed
8960,ijcztm,"tbf the blue lives flags aren't actual national flags. There is no requirements regulating how they are made, and it doesn't bother me a whit when they're burned because they're the flags of a nation with no citizenship. They are not the American flag, just a pale parody of one."
8961,ijcztm,"Also, one is a real flag and the other is a boys club symbol"
8962,ijcztm,all flags are generally made the same way if they're meant for outdoors. the majority of flags require an accelerant to burn.
8963,ijcztm,"It's a novelty flag, most likely made of polyester."
8964,ijcztm,"I learned this little factoid on Mr. Show: it’s impossible to shit, piss, or vomit on an American flag.

8965,ijcztm,You cant dump gasoline on it?
8966,ijcztm,Just wait to you see actualpublicfreakouts. Makes publicfreakout look like moderate liberals.
8967,ijcztm,the comments are mostly supporting the protesters.
8968,ijcztm,"From what I've seen it mostly supports the protest, and r/ actualpublicfreakouts are the fash"
8969,ijcztm,"yeah, if you're gonna use aerosols, spray them over the flag until it is saturated and then burn it after the fact."
8970,ijcztm,[removed]
8971,ijcztm,This is really dependant on the aerosol. It needs to have an oxidizer in the can to do that.
8972,ijcztm,"As someone already said, it depends on if there is an oxidizer in the can. However, if the can heats up to much from being close to the fire, then it can explode."
8973,ijcztm,"I know you said you've seen it happen twice, but with what I know about the subject and my experience makes me skeptical.

How would the flame follow the spray as it's being pushed away from the can rapidly? If that is possible, how would a can with virtually no oxygen explode? Aerosol cans typically expldoe only when they're heated up."
8974,ijcztm,"Beg my pardon, but how is that possible? If you don't overheat the can for a while and as long as the can is intact, there is no way it will blow up. A flame can't ""follow the aerosol back into the can"", thats just not how it works."
8975,ijcztm,Nice
8976,ijcztm,"The US flag is already desecrated, don't need the police to help."
8977,ijcztm,"A good response to ""Blue Lives Matter!"" is ""All Professions' Lives Matter!""

Some woman online called me a pedophile for that response."
8978,ijcztm,Yep. Automatically screams I’m a racist
8979,ijcztm,"To be more specific, this flag is a reference to cops who call themselves ""the thin blue line."" The U.S. police think they are the barrier between communities and criminals, or between order and chaos. To represent this, they remade the American flag so that it's black and white with just one blue stripe through the middle. 

I honestly believe they made the flag black and white to imitate the aesthetic of The Punisher from Marvel. Who is an anti-cop, anti-hero vigilante, but the irony is lost on the piggies."
8980,ijcztm,It’s a pro cop thing
8981,ijcztm,"It's a white supremacist dog whistle. It says ""I support the cops killing innocent black people."""
8982,ijcztm,"It astounds me that there are people who listened to Rage and are just now coming out like ""I love your music but stay out of politics"". Like what about their songs did they think was apolitical?"
8983,ijcztm,"Because cops are automatically “heroes” because of their jobs as you implied. They are not all heroes, they are people with jobs who can carry a gun and basically get away with anything. 

And they think they are persecuted?

If they feel so threatened, QUIT, and get a different job."
8984,ijcztm,"That flag doesn't represent ""the good ones."" That's not what that flag represents. That flag is a retaliation towards BLM. It's designed to sew discord.

Every officer, bigoted or not, is complicit in a broken and racist system. The thin blue line represents their willingness to back 12 up no matter the circumstances."
8985,ijcztm,"\> non bigot cops

&#x200B;

lmao"
8986,ijcztm,"Because those “non bigot cops” work with cops who definitely are bigots and don’t do shit about it. 

Not to mention working in a broken, racist system that has done their absolute best to kill black people and get away with it."

8988,ijcztm,"For 4 straight years, I produced panel after panel discussion on Brexit where every guest from every background basically asked Britain ""Bby gurl what is you doin???"" and all y'all had to say in response is ""whatever we want lol"""
8989,ijcztm,"Definitely printed polyester, that's why it doesn't burn so much as it melts away.

I hate how there's even a market for such cheaply produced flags. The whole point of displaying it is pride, how can you take pride in a mass-produced piece of synthetic cloth that costs $4?"
8990,ijcztm,"I think it's happened in just a couple weeks too, because a month ago r/publicfreakout was basically videos exposing police brutality. The actual one has always been a right wing cesspool as far as I know. Silver lining of the last few months is that right wing now easily just covers alt right as well, no need to differentiate."
8991,ijcztm,"Oof, yeah my folks were paramedics in NYC back in the 80s and saw this exact thing. Someone tried burning a flag with an aerosol can and it blew up, the guy lost most of his arm and an eye to shrapnel."
8992,ijcztm,"And uhhhhh...

8998,ijcztm,"they’re desecrating the flag for political reasons too, which you’d think they’d be against"
8999,ijcztm,"astute observers will notice the blue line on the flag doesn't even seperate anything, which is perfect accidental symbolism."
9000,ijcztm,Thank you for your answer.
9001,ijcztm,"> Who is an anti-cop, anti-hero vigilante, but the irony is lost on the piggies

I mean, he also commits acts of extrajudicial murder against people the cops might perceive as undesirables. Seems like they’re fully on board with that and are zeroing in on one interpretation of the character."
9002,ijcztm,Disgusting
9003,ijcztm,Are you suggesting that “Pistol-grip Pump” is NOT an advertisement for Supersoakers???
9004,ijcztm,"'Shes the one who likes all our pretty songs, and she likes to sing along, but she knows not what it means...'"
9005,ijcztm,"You argument isnt really that valid. There heroes sure, but just like a soldier doesnt attack another soldier if they break military law/commit a war crime. They wait until there given the order to arrest the cops who did said crime so they don't get fired. And never get away with it. Yes it sometimes is unjust and takes a couple months but they are inevitably charged just like the cops who killed George Floyd."
9006,ijcztm,"Exactly, if the ""good cops"" are so good, why don't they stop the bad ones?"
9007,ijcztm,Very inevitable- I’m English so I’m stuck with the chips and rotting teeth

9011,ijcztm,"Yeah I never say ActualPublicFreakouts until recently and it's all very much alt-righters in the comments.

Apologists for that 17 year murder and shit. It's a disgusting sub filled with hateful people. It definitely has a hate-subreddit vibe."
9012,ijcztm,"PF is the original, APF is the right-wing counter to it and ironically, most of their posts don't even have *actual* freakouts, just low-effort racist bullshit.

I think very recently it's been spilling over into publicfreakout because they just can't stand all them libtards covering police brutality."
9013,ijcztm,"jesus, i've heard some horror stories from people not respecting pressurised gasses and aerosols and i'm just glad i have never had to see any injuries like that in person."
9014,ijcztm,"FFS I thought this was a myth (was told that the pressure was too high to allow the flame to travel backwards into the can) and have done this many, many times. So I could have lost my arm and/or eyes for silly insignificant reasons like killing flies that were annoying me?!"
9015,ijcztm,"I mean if youve used sprays they are desiged for bursts and sustained spray tends to leave one with their hands pretty soaked with whatever the aerosol is and droplets flying, its not incredibly likely, but its possible enough to be cautious when  there are easier safer ways"
9016,ijcztm,"Oh, really?"
9017,ijcztm,Nice
9018,ijcztm,Oooh I like that one.
9019,ijcztm,"It occupies space that's white, and divides black. I noticed this the first time I saw it. It seems very intentional. 

People who design flags study, and put emphasis on symbolism like this. Color, placement, and shapes all have meanings in vexilology."
9020,ijcztm,NEWS TO ME!
9021,ijcztm,"My question is, and its more of a rhetorical question. But the military is held to the UCMJ. Why is there nothing like that for LEO's?

Again, I don't expect an answer, just something i've personally questioned."
9022,ijcztm,"Being a ""good person"" in some peoples' minds, involves minding your own business. Cop or not, some people seem to think that as long as you only worry about yourself (which honestly sounds meaningless to me), and you don't personally do anything directly bad, then you're good/decent."
9023,ijcztm,The same reason that good white people don’t stop the bad white people

9028,ijcztm,Explain?
9029,ijcztm,There's definitely an organized takeover happening. The Meta has shifted rapidly against protesters in the last few weeks.
9030,ijcztm,"*Disclaimer: This is completely made up but makes sense to me:*

I think what happens is if there is a constant flow, but the pressure starts to relieve, that's the moment that the flame will travel into the can. I've ignited many a spritz of AXE body spray in my time and never had one explode on me but I'm guessing it's because I don't spray it for very long."
9031,ijcztm,"Yeah, I did the same dumb shit in my formative years, my parents luckily schooled me before I did any damage."
9032,ijcztm,"No, was just being hyperbolic. Using rocket fuel would be a bad idea."
9033,ijcztm,"right but the symbolism of the flag now is that the thin blue line seperates... chaos from more chaos? they didn't think it through, they just went with it but it's truly how they feel."
9034,ijcztm,Well the police are kinda just expected to follow the law there supposed to uphold. Unfortunately not all do.

9038,e203x2,"Murdering civilians is exactly the kind of thing Trumps going to be asking the military to do, men like Gallagher are the kind of people he's going to need to violently put down opposition in this country"
9039,e203x2,"This is a clear signal to Trump loyalists in the armed forces, that if they want to do morally reprehensible things, all they need to do is be loyal to Trump and avoid any repercussions.

This is the firsts steps of a coup"
9040,e203x2,If trump wins a second term he will probably nominate Gallagher for a cabinet position or something. He wants to reward this sort of cruelty.
9041,e203x2,"Source? Not defending him just want to read it for myself

Edit: thanks for the silver! That’s my first award ever!"
9042,e203x2,Trump loves these type of people. Remember the ad he took out against the alleged gang members on NY? Trump and his enablers are fascists.
9043,e203x2,"Fuck, I thought he was referring to Gallagher, the '70s/'80s Sledge-O-Matic^™ prop comedian, and I wondered what would cause him to stoop so low as to murdering civilians, and why was he using a rifle and NOT the Sledge-O-Matic^™ ?

Fortunately, the confusion cleared..."
9044,e203x2,What I don’t get is if he says he didn’t knife the guy in the neck and all of a sudden the other guy says that it was actually him that knifed the guy. How could Gallagher not know it was the other guy? Are there just multiple Seals stabbing folks that they can’t keep track?
9045,e203x2,Fucking Nazi Scumbags
9046,e203x2,"You know they thought he was fucked up if they were willing to be like ""1.75 fireteams is fine, we'll get by."""
9047,e203x2,"I don't fully understand twitter, but do they put replies *above* the comment to which they're replying?"

9053,e203x2,"Remember Joe the Plumber?

Now we have Joe the War Criminals"
9054,e203x2,Matt seems to be confused. He seems to be under the impression that that is something trump or his supporters care about. All they care about is trump winning again. That's it. Doesn't matter how or who with.

9057,e203x2,[removed]
9058,e203x2,Does noone remember collateral murder wiki leaks proved that the US military kills civilians. Since then thousands of new documents exposed how they still kill civilians and separate innocent families as prevn by the Australian ABC. For the love of god go after the governments like America that commit war crimes but please don't do it just for trump because then when his out of office noone will give a damn.
9059,e203x2,Goddamn that's terrifying and sick.
9060,e203x2,"All my info about Gallagher comes from Donut Operator. Do you guys think he really killed the kid and do you guys think donut is a pig? In every single one of his videos he does try to make police look like the only good guys and that they're always perfect, but I haven't seen any vids from him for about 6 months now"
9061,e203x2,He was acquitted u dumbfucks

9064,e203x2,"Didn't he already ask about shooting immigrants trying to cross the border then when told that was illegal ask about shooting them in the legs?

And I'm sure he's on record stating they should go after terrorist's families.

So yeah..."
9065,e203x2,"He may not ask the military to do it - as we’ve seen, there are people in those institutions who will refuse to carry out illegal and immoral orders, even if that means a minimum set of consequences that includes ending your career and being demonized by a bunch of heavily-armed terrorists.

He *will* be asking paramilitary groups to do it.  These groups will likely be (are?) staffed and / or led by veterans without such scruples, who will use their rank, service history, clout, credentials, and charisma to convince others to break the law for them, ie for Trump.

The normalization of abhorrent violence done to non-American civilians is a dry-run for the application of violence to American civilians.  We are the boiling frog.  I’m not going to openly advocate for violence or anything on here but we need to come to terms with what’s in store for us before it’s too late to prepare for it.  They’re going to be bringing the violence to us, there should not be any doubt.  Their little nazi dicks are so hard for it, it’s one of their favorite things to talk about.  Each of us needs to be both mentally, emotionally, and physically prepared for this as much as possible.  If you can’t be, then you must find some other way to protect yourself, perhaps by either forming a close alliance with someone capable or in the worst case scenario leaving the country."
9066,e203x2,Likely already happening since they stopped reporting drone strike numbers.
9067,e203x2,"I think they should have put one in the guy and said he was cleaning his gun and it went off, or blamed it on an insurgent counter sniper or something, but people like that don't deserve to be part of humanities team."
9068,e203x2,Good thing there's a little thing called the 2A to protect against something like that... Or are you anti-gun as well?
9069,e203x2,"scary isn't it, expect to see RW death squads in heavily democratic areas intimidating people and preventing them from voting in 2020"
9070,e203x2,"Absolutely that is what it is. But frankly, they probably knew that already."
9071,e203x2,Imagine; Trump starts awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to psychopaths like Gallagher.
9072,e203x2,He'll make him head of an ethics oversight committee.
9073,e203x2,"Left-wing subs: ask for a source, get upvoted, usually get a reliable source

Right-wing subs: ask for a source, get downvoted and called a communist, get told to ""educate yourself"" or ""open your eyes,"" if source is provided it's either in opposition to the claim being made or is a dubious source such as ""EducatingLibs.com"" that cannot be cross-verified by anything on the internet

They weren't alleged gang members, they were alleged rapists who were coerced into testifying against each other while they were illegally detained for days without contact with their parents.

Trump took out a full page ad calling for the death penalty for these innocent teenagers whose only crime was hanging out in Central Park while black."

9078,e203x2,"He came up and stabbed a wounded kid in the neck and walked away.  Once he walked away, the guy who was already with the kid when he walked up suffocated the kid to put him out of his misery since he now had a knife sticking out of his neck. So technically Gallagher ""didn't kill him""."
9079,e203x2,"Not exactly. Normally when someone replies to a tweet, it does go below it in a thread. You can read top-down.

The US supported YPG and HPG, the military arms of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), the same group who has been at war with Turkey. Even though ISIS is worse than them, we have to acknowledge that the US has been supporting yet another terrorist organization against a common enemy. Though you may be in support of the Kurds because they have been fighting against ISIS with Antifa, you have to know that Turkey is fully within its right to fight against PKK if there is a possibility of ending the terrorism in Turkey.

At the end of the day, they are in no way worse than ISIS and I am grateful, as a Turk and a dem-soc, for their fight against ISIS. But for the end of terrorism in the world, the US has to stop supporting terrorist organizations and fight against all terrorist organizations.

But here is the thing you asking the corporation to deplatform them.

So if they ban someone on the right they ban someone on the left. Example when they went after Crowder they demonetised also left political youtube shows.

We aren't talking about the PKK, we are talking the YPG, YPJ, and associated groups. They are the ones that bother to follow the laws of war. Try that with the mujahideen, Assad, and his allies."

i also recommend reading a bit on the actual history of nonviolent protest. for example, MLK was a well-known gun owner and advocate for community defense. conviction is not enough to justify pacifism; you need to demonstrate efficacy."

Fuck Nazi's and what they stand for but just outright attacking them for using words is a slippery slope because that opens up justification for everyone to attack anyone who says something that they disagree with.

""Oh, that guy says the protesters in Hong Kong are illegal and they should just obey the laws of China, I don't like that he said that so I'm going to go kick him in the face"""
9398,etrtuj,"If attacked physically then you respond that way but mature people don't kick someone in the face or attack someone for words. No matter how vile those words. 

There is a clear line between ""adults"" who can be pushed to violence because someone said something that pissed them off and actual mature adults who realize life is full of shit that's gonna provoke you and you certainly can't just punch people because you never learned to control your anger. 

I completely understand your zeal and you feel like you are doing the right thing by shutting up Nazi's by attacking them but that's not the way the real world works. 

You have to let them state their opinions and reasoning and then attack their viewpoint. With words and logic.

Dude, one of the most hardcore members of the Westboro Baptist Church (Megan Phelps-Roper) was convinced she was wrong because someone took the time to talk to her and debate her on Twitter. Imagine if she was just kicked off of Twitter and banned from social media, she would have just doubled down on her beliefs and felt persecuted and it's damn near impossible to convince someone who feels persecuted that their viewpoint is wrong. 

You can't shut people up through violence or kicking them off social media, you need to let people state their opinion and then try to dissuade them with actual knowledge. 

A lot of Nazi's or alt right are just misinformed and just need knowledgeable people to poke holes in their viewpoint. They may be just youngsters who have been raised into the life and have never known anything besides racism. You can't really blame those right? Imagine if you were 3 years old and you start getting indoctrinated into racism, you don't really stand a chance unless someone outside takes the time to talk to you.

That conversation isn't going to happen if we just kick those people off of Twitter for expressing ignorant opinions, someone needs to debate with them and show them why they are wrong. 

That's why I feel it's not a good idea to kick these people off of social media or physically attacking them, I've had plenty of stupid ideas and mindsets until I expressed them to a smarter person and they were able to show me  where my thinking went off track. 

But if I had said something ignorant and then gotten physically attacked then I probably would have doubled down on the ideas because it's human nature to do so. 

Obviously not all of the alt right and Nazi's are going to fall into this category. There are going to be absolute irredeemable shitbags mixed in but I think that a lot of the alt right are on the younger side just like a lot of antifa are on the younger side and the awesome thing about being young is you can make mistakes and then realize you were wrong and make that mental change. 



But as soon as you get punched in the face for ignorant opinions that have been drilled into your head since you were a kid then you feel you were right the entire time and the rest of the world wants to shut you up.

At a rally or a public gathering isn't going to be the place to confront their ideas though because it's a really emotionally charged event and they are around a bunch of people who are reinforcing their opinion. 

The time to try to change their opinion is online when you can debate back and forth and they don't feel backed into a corner physically or mentally. 

This is a really long comment but I'm hoping to translate one of the reasons I feel the 1st amendment and free speech are really important, you need to feel free to have dumb ideas and express those ideas freely as long as you aren't calling for violence. 

Ideas expressed freely are open to debate and you may get the person taking to you who might change your mind or at least give you a different point of perspective."

Certainly it isn’t one which falls under freedom of speech — well, technically you can but then you have to live with the consequences of your action. 

It’s one of the extremes on this planet that doesn’t deserve _ANY_ form of protection, rather it needs to be opposed by any force necessary to put Nazism where it belongs: to non existence. 

These folks want to eradicate millions, if not billions, if you let them — and the world already did that, tried the “peaceful approach”, remember WW2, yeah... that!

So if we have someone who wants to kill me, but I kill them first in self defence, is it the same atrocity? I mean, both cases would end in a lost life and a “killer”. But is it the same?

Every judge and jury would deem it self defence and you’re free to walk away. (unless you’re a minority and some other special things fell into place, but that’s not the point here)

There are very few movements on this planet that are as extreme and atrocious as Nazism or Daesh, none of which should exist in the first place and deserves any form of protection. 

And if something doesn’t deserve any form of protection because it’s so inherently evil to humanity, any form of action to stop it from exiting is a just action."
9404,etrtuj,"> Also, I don’t understand the statement “I’m not going to wait for a nazi to punch me”. Do you hit other cars on the road just in case they were gonna hit you?

Ah, using an alt right dogwhistle unironically. Not a good look, Mr ""I'm an anti-fascist but don't like antifa""."
9466,etrtuj,"Hey, you do know what a double negative is, right? Anti anti fascist is literally pro-fascist. You can disagree with certain people’s methods, but there is no proper noun Antifa, the thing you’re arguing against doesn’t exist.

Also, while labelling people nazi could be argued to be a misnomer, since a lot of the time they don’t call themselves nazis, what they politically self-identify as ultimately doesn’t matter, if they’re supporting fascism, they’re a nazi. Doesn’t matter if it’s ironic, what matters is the effect."
9467,etrtuj,Why even bring this up in a thread about a guy literally doing the Nazi salute? It just screams bad faith.

And a million soldiers is a conservative estimate for what that would have took. During WW2 India raised the greatest volunteer army in history. 2,5 million soldiers. Who were trained to fight the axis and did so. So any indian rebellion would have had millions of trained soldiers and thousands of hardened combat veterans to draw from.

Love this phrasing and framing. Complementary to what I've been telling all the people obsessing over Biden: voting is the *least* you can do.

>I can't comprehend how the same country that goes ""welp we need the Second Amendment to overthrow a tyrannical government""...

Because they're not the same factions. The first group tends to be nationalists and conservative. Those people don't give a fuck about nonviolence.

It all comes down to this: they don't believe [insert any liberal cause] has cause for complaint. It's not that the nationalists believe in nonviolence, it's that they question the motives of those who protest, since no one they know cares about these concerns. 

Those who protest are thought of as lazy, drugged out hippies, or criminal looters, or gang members, or lazy inferiors trying to leech off the system. And the only thing ThOsE PeOpLe will respond to is punishment (thus violent repression).

But if someone whom they agree with and identify with had a complaint, they will be quick to run to their guns.

Forget about riots, they will take the same stance at people blocking traffic, causing a minor inconvenience. It's not about tactics, it's about the fact that they don't want to be inconvenienced by a protest they give zero fucks about.

It's liberals that obsess over nonviolence, not jingoistic nationalist gun nuts. The liberals are also against state violence. They don't experience much state violence so they have the privilege to advocate for ""go slow, ask nicely."" The main thing they learned about the American revolution was that it all hinged on a nonviolent protest involving a bit of tea.

And then there are bunch of sheep who haven't thought too deeply about it, and just parrot whatever contradictory messages they're hearing."

MLK sought to repeat repeat the racial cooperation of populism in the 1880s.

9859,gxnbrs,"Fascism is a political ideology defined by social and political authoritarianism and ultra-nationalism. This is supported by ferocious anti-liberalism, anti-socialism and a violently exclusionist expansionist agenda. It also espouses a corporatist economic system.

The nationalist element is core to fascism as it sees the nation as the key societal element and the strenghth of that nation is paramount to the exclusion of virtually all else. To further this fascism always paints ""its group"" as the hard done by victim and ties up an individuals self esteem into the greater glory and achievments of the group. This links back into the corporatist economic ideas of fascism.

Fascism is not just ""being nasty to people you don't agree with"" or ""violence"" as the state has the authority of violence yet we do not call it fascist."

WW1 began pretty much solely because groups of allies felt compelled to join in a fight relevant to their allies, but not really relevant to themselves, and then hell broke lose because the entire world was fighting in a conflict that really only involved two countries. Hence, the attack on Pearl Harbor made the US appear like it had it’s own reason to join that had nothing to do with its allies, though of course it helped its allies plenty. Not to mention the US was helping the war effort an amount before they officially entered the war, they just weren’t directly involved in the war itself with their own troops.

9921,gxnbrs,"Doesn't help that the usa administration knew of the impending attack on Pearl Harbor and did nothing to stop it.

Or that many citizens of the usa agreed with Nazi Eugenics until scientific and public opinion turned against it, forcing the usa to finally condemn the supposed racial supremacy rhetoric from Hitler.

It does look like reddit had a list that no matter what those subs would be banned. Almost like they are promoting an agenda. I've seen worse shit in much more mainstream subs. This is just a commission. They are paid to do this. And whether you like those subs or not is irrelevant. The fact that they do it shows how little they care about freedom of speech and the right to have an opinion. What's even worse is that now certain ideologies are being can play the martyr card and attract more people because of reddit's poor handling of this situation. Also this can escalate things. I think everyone should be allowed to have an opinion as long as it doesn't affect the society in a bad way. Reddit doesn't."

But the real reason to say fuck chapo is that the place (both the sub and podcast) is the pinnacle of dirtbag leff, ie class reductionists and intentional dicks to women, blacks and disabled ppl. It also was a good recruitment ground for the alt-right."
10078,hi467n,"Nah, CTH was a Liberal SocDem Paradise."
10079,hi467n,It was a place where people antithetical to Nazi trumptards would post. Reddit banned it because muh centrism and muh both sides for when the president of the United States complains about muh conservative censorship.

10089,hi467n,Gott set the narrative. I wonder how many of these anti fascists posting on here are really just white twitter resisters. Long live Chapo
10090,hi467n,"> I never understood why so many leftists defame the sub and why it was quarantined

Comments would often propose violence, punching fascists or violent revolutions as recommendations, even if it was mostly jokes (at least I don't know about any cth inspired violence, people willing to punch nazis were probably willing to punch nazis without edgy memes about hogs).

I kinda see how many ~~libs~~ users would feel it is unfair cth gets to talk about eating the rich or guillotining the political class all the time, while people talking about killing leftists or muslims or gays would get banned.  So probably quarantine was a reasonable business decision. Plus if anybody ever did any CTH inspired violence, be it false flag or not, that'd be a really bad look for everybody, both reddit and the left. So while I'm sad to see it go it was kinda inevitable."
10091,hi467n,Libs gonna lib.
10092,hi467n,"Cause most mildly left people who grew up in the west grew up with only anti marxist leftist figures. Anyone who is a marxist just gets called a tankie because we think there are lessons to learn from the socialist states that have existed. Supposedly that's an endorsement of everything ever done by everyone in a country and an endorsement of mass murder degrees of magnitude worse than the crimes the fascists, which so many communists died fighting. Only the craziest ultras shut down good faith conversations on tankie-related subjects, the rest of us are interested in explaining these concepts to libs who, like us, were lied to about and shielded from this avenue of thinking most of their lives"

10101,hi467n,"I agree there were a lot of violations towards the end, but that only happened because everyone knew the ban was coming. And everyone knew it was happening for exactly the reasons I said, so may as well shitpost on the way out. 

Even if CTH had been a model subreddit they or an equivalent ""left"" subreddit would have been banned along with The Donald. The content or adherence of the subreddit has nothing to do with it. It's the fact that reddit administration needed a prominent, token ""left"" sub to ban alongside TD so as to be able to promote their ""fair and balanced, both sides"" argument. 

There was never *any* circumstance where reddit banned The Donald without simultaneously banning a popular leftist sub in order to appease the right. The specifics, the content, and compliance be damned."
10102,hi467n,sounds like lib shit

**Edit:** Maybe a couple of them got taken out before, I don't remember and I don't keep across it as much as I used to. Don't take my word as gospel."
10105,hi467n,They also banned gendercritical - good riddance to those fucking TERFs.
10106,hi467n,"CTH was full of shitposts and violent memes/rhetoric. The mods let the sub violate site-wide guidelines, after they were already quarantined, so they should have known better. So far, the list of subs seems pretty equitable. This isn't an attack on the left any more than it's an attack on the right."
10107,hi467n,"It was apparently a sub that the alt-rights used to slander the antifa movement, I think that it got banned a long time ago."

10109,hi467n,"A bunch of users on CTH spun those up back when the sub first got quarantined.  I wandered over to CTH2 one time and there was some...lovingly drawn AOC foot art that would have made Ben Shapiro renounce the alt-right and become a tankie had he seen it.

10112,hi467n,"This happens every wave of bans though.  The nice thing is that they all try to spin up replacements for their little hard-right wank-pits so instead of one shitty sub you get ~~40~~ 88 new subs and they all end up being low traffic/low effort.

What's fun is they're all screaming about how they're going to Ruqqus or whatever the fuck it is, exactly like how they were all gonna go to Voat.  Problem is Ruqqus, like Voat, is running on an old phone that's sitting in someone's desk and it's been DDoS'd for at least three days with all the new traffic.

So they'll spend a week trying to recreate the majik over there, fail and come back here to the watered down shitsubs they built as a safe space."

""fascist apologizing""? I don't condone fascism, and I didn't say I did?

They shouldn't be allowed to ban dissent, and if for whatever reason they refused to allow it, that would be a _great_ reason to ban the sub - but that's not what happened and it certainly wasn't even close to the only sub (or archetype of sub) that was banned.

Making such a huge sweeping move with no warning and based on one of the vaguest and poorly-worded rules I've seen is a blatant assault on free speech on this site. It just is."

10135,hi467n,"Idk, I was trying to have debates in conservative last week as the sub is just overrun with anti-BLM garbage.  Articles about “black on black crime”,  they posted the bubba Wallace fake noose finding several times all jumping on a racist victim blaming bandwagon.  They interchangeably use the words liberal, left, socialism, communism, anarchism; it’s all the same to them.  I’ve seen people referring to Antifa as “the new SA Brownshirts” and arguing “Nazis are leftists” which to me says they know their history well enough to spin a revisionist web, which suggests an intention to spread misinformation.  I do believe there are people who are conservative trump supporters who are just well meaning idiots who aren’t really paying attention, but that’s not the majority in these subs, I find.

When talking about monument removal someone pulled the “They’re erasing history!” line and the response was, “We need to get rid of them before they get rid of us.”

So idk, the users there seem more hateful with intentions to stir up the community and make enemies out of their fellow citizens, which seems more evil than just touting political or capitalist views."

10147,hi467n,"What they were was a place that tolerated misappropriation of leftist language for use against genuine leftist ideology.  They allowed false actors role-playing as tankies to run around equating fascists with any left-wing person who didn't meet some arbitrary bullshit purity test.  And it served primarily as a platform to attack left-of-center candidates with conspiracy theories and other horseshit under the umbrella of ""supporting Bernie"", spreading conspiracy theories and other misinformation under the cover of JuSt A jOkE bRo memes.  

It was a troll den, and like all troll dens it was subverted by the worst of the trolls.  But its original, and primary purpose was to flaunt the rules of reddit in EXACTLY the same way that the right-wing hate subs did, engaging in brigades and vote manipulation, to highlight the hypocrisy of the reddit admins in how they failed to apply their ""site-wide"" rules.  CTH's *entire reason for existence* was to get TD banned.  And among all the other things it did, it accomplished that objective.

So cheers, CTH.  Thank you for your service.  I wish you had been better, but what you were was more than enough to make a contribution."
10148,hi467n,"Yea it’s pretty clear you don’t know what you’re talking about besides what Reddit tells you. CTH was many things, definitely far from perfect and probably not a sustainable community, but it was not intentional dicks to women, disabled people, or “blacks”. For one, it was hugely supportive of trans rights, if you didn’t support lgbt 110% they didn’t put up with you. If anything, you were treated like a weirdo if you were heteronormative. it was explicitly anti-racist and people would flame the fuck out of you if you unironically supported class reductionism."
10149,hi467n,"Lmfao what? Of all the criticisms to be leveled against chapo, sexism and racism have got to be some of the most absurd. And PLEASE enlighten me as to how a sub that predicated half of its existence on making fun of the alt right, made it a recruitment ground for the alt right."

Either way, it isn't worth my time to engage with you.

And on the *extreme* off-chance that I'm wrong about you, *this isn't the place for you to learn*, **google** is.

There was one small subreddit a CTH found and posted about it to the sub. It was a subreddit for doxxing and harassing girls that used OnlyFans, and CTH got it banned/locked within a day of brigading it. So, y'know, as far as brigading goes, that's pretty solid.

Outside of that, I can't remember any real large scale brigading when I was over there."

So I posted a screenshot to CTH and in response the neolib thread saw comments from chapos defending themselves or straight up saying ""half of us are gay."" They reported it as a brigade and banned me from r/neolib. That's the type of ""brigading"" CTH was guilty of."

/uj The sub suffered from irony poison. The posts and comments were baked in so many stupid layers of irony that it's understandable that people saw it like this. However, your post here betrays how unfamiliar you were with the sub and it's overall beliefs. You stated for instance that they had a heavy support for Bernie but the sub constantly shat on Bernie for not being left enough.

And while they do say they are champions of equality, not only did they never challenge bigotry in the community but they actively start harassment campaigns (against women mostly) when there are accusations of bigotry against them. Those repeated harassment campaigns is what (after a loong time) got media attention and got CTH quarantined and banned, not spamming ""death to slaveowners"".

10264,hi467n,"I'm also extremely far left, generally to the point where when some punk-ass kid calls me a ""lib"" I genuinely laugh because they don't know *shit*.

I understand being emotionally invested in a subreddit.  This one here is my *jams*, and I love my mods and genu-wine-ly LOVE the efforts and sincerity, and most specifically the *honesty* and *passion* of the contributors and commenters here.  There is no ambiguous meme-ery here, this place *exists to destroy fascism*, and to do that by showing us exactly what it looks like and how to effectively fight it.  I understand loving a sub.

Now, regardless of how you feel about CTH, *it wasn't anywhere near that*.  And to a point, that's OK.  I understand loving ""jokes"" and ""shitposting"" and other forms of ""trolling"", but there becomes a problem when a sub allows those things to be used to mask something darker, and from what I saw CTH  very much *did*.

And I think this was unavoidable:  CTH's relationship with honest discourse was modeled after TD's, and it *seriously* and *intentionally* allowed the line to be blurred between troll and honest participant--this is in fact fundamental in the ""allow shitposting"" philosophy.  And while it seems to me that a huge number of people from there (and other shitpost subs) claim to sincerely believe they could defeat Poe's law, that they could tell when they were laughing *at* bad people instead of along with them, the truth is they *couldn't*.  You **cannot** tell the difference between a sincere lunatic and a sufficiently dedicated parody.  It simply is not possible, regardless of how you feel, and your belief otherwise is *trivial* to exploit to get you to support intolerance and hatred.  It's even more trivial to exploit that false belief in order to get you to attack your allies as ""liberals"".  Once you adopt one false belief (i.e. ***I*** *can tell who's just joking*), you invite yourself to support almost anything so long as it *entertains you.*

And the key factor about that whole ""liberal"" thing is that the vast majority of people there who use ""liberal"" as an insult neither know nor care what the word means, or *why it's a bad thing to be*.  I've had multiple conversations with people *today* who think it just means ""not a socialist"" or even ""not a communist"".  What it generally means is ""I accuse you of being slightly to the right of me"", which means it has *almost exactly the same meaning* as when the *nazis* accuse people of being liberals.  And the majority of them sure as HELL don't worry about the difference between a liberal and a fascist (which, primarily, is that discourse is effective against liberals but not fascists), and in fact discussing that point was effectively a bannable offense.

I definitely am not trying to excuse those homophobic beliefs though. I think the main problem I had with CTH’s critique of Orwell is that they made it out to be Orwell’s fault that his writing is used as anti-communist propaganda in schools.

But if your rhetorical strategy is one to provide a logical and reasonable counterpoint to the incoherent horseshit then from an angle of the fence-sitter this is a small victory for us; it's not like this is going to be the first or the last time that they will encounter this argument and by doing this in a performative way then it provides some small amount of resistance to the narrative.

>It keeps you busy while they shout more dog whistles to gather allies.

That isn't going to happen in this sub.

>In short, you're handing them the microphone.

I really think that you're underestimating me here. Heck, a peach of a person once new knew me well enough that they could vouch for me on this matter but I don't think that would convince you...

>*Discourse doesn't work against fascists*. 

This wasn't discourse, this was performance. I already mentioned that I wasn't engaging the discussion from a  place of good faith or as an exchange of ideas.

I understand what you're saying but you have to see that the reason for why their method works is that they engage on a performative level (*not* Butlerian performativity if anyone's getting tangled up with terms here) and not a discursive way (not Foucault either) and by taking a strategic approach and using their own strategy against them along with exploiting their own insufficiency to change the perspective of people who are in between our two positions.

>These people are not *arguing* with you, they are wasting your time and energy, while normalizing their mantras.

Exactly. And this is a counter-strategy.

>Their words aren't designed to *convince* anyone, but to demonstrate that they can't, and won't, change their beliefs in the face of reason.

I'm not convinced that this is how that functions in the context of this sub.

It's not an ironic strategy though, but even if it were there's the ironic engagement of concepts of freedom if speech and the effect of rational debate and especially an ironic shifting of the burden of responsibility for ""radicalization"" and ""deradicalization"" onto the bystanders by removing individual agency of people who are moving down the alt-right pipeline *and* equally as importantly by the bad actors such as that guy. 

What your argument would mean is that the ironic engagement in the concept of freedom of speech should actually support freedom speech unintentionally, however this is patently and demonstrably untrue.

They are syncretic in their beliefs and they have a fundamental core of anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, so if you approach this situation from the angle that I do you can use the ideological vulnerabilities inherent in their worldview to undermine what they are attempting to do."
10286,hi467n,"No, you need to do the *barest amount of effort* to trouble *yourself* to learn the answers to your obviously disingenuous questions before I will consider it to be not a waste of my time to treat you seriously.  If that's ""falling in line"", then so be it.  And that starts with not treating ME like a fucking search engine for terms **you can google**.

And if the mods remove your comments without feeling the need to inform you, that's an even BIGGER indication that they agree that you're not serious.  Take it up with them."

I was always pro lgb but I used to think that Trans people were ‘just a trend’ and CTH helped me realize how foolish and naive I was.

Trump’s administration is corrupt to its core attached to a corrupt tree. They have everything to lose and very little precedent of consequences for them stealing the election. Combine that with the Dems being toothless and expectant that one day soon the GOP will see the light and play fair.

If everyone doesn’t go vote this November it’ll be another 4 years of Trump, and probably never an actual Dem President until the US is dissolved."

10365,hi467n,"I mean I really don't feel like pretending to be something I'm not to earn points with liberals.

And sure, some people might immediately write you off or not take what you say seriously, but it still helps further normalize it in their minds.

10367,hi467n,"No, you bring them to a point where they make a statement of values which is superficially quite tolerable for the regular person or which appeals to conventional wisdom. This is how they begin to ""recruit"" from the mainstream.

Then, rather than letting them pile in with their conclusions and their rhetorical strategies or their vague gesturing at their own ideological concepts instead you corner them into a position where they either *must* reject their original position due to the contradictions in their arguments, which is an absolute loss in the eyes of the onlookers, or they must accept an entirely reprehensible and ethically repugnant position which is the logical conclusion of their argument, which is an absolute loss in the eyes of the onlookers.

It's just a strategy that draws them into a double-bind where they are no longer capable of hiding their power level and they must abandon the discussion in humiliation regardless of which option they choose because even simply retreating at that point that the exchange is at (which they will, I guarantee it, but I hope they don't because I can show you the next countermove if they reply) leaves me with the strong statements as the last words.

>So you ask a lot of rhetorical strawman questions that put words in other people's mouths

It's *not* a debate or discourse, it's performative. I keep telling you this.

>...and pretend like that supports your ideology.

Not all of us turn into selfish assholes wih age..."
10382,dzhl5l,"My theory is that even though Boomers were often liberal in their youth, they lived in a world where they were only able to access one viewpoint of the world (usually a conservative one) through the evening news or what have you. Eventually, that narrative would slowly be hammered into them to the point that they couldn't accept any others. We, on the other hand, live in a world where any viewpoint is at our fingertips, which allows us to base our opinions on facts."
10383,dzhl5l,"I’ve had boomers criticize me for being “idealistic” and that they “remember those times when they were young”. Now they’re “liberals” (conservative), and are “realistic”. Sound like sell-outs to me."
10384,dzhl5l,"That might have been true, generations ago, when people started developing wealth and coming to see their interests aligned with the wealthy whom are actually served by a no holds barred laissez fair capitalism.

Curiously its the wealthy's success in driving inequity to untold highs, with generations of supply side trickle down economics that are breaking this pattern.

People who are suffering under this capitalist system aren't going to be likely to support it, and the number of people ""winning"" is falling every year as inequity rises.

the flip side of that coin is that conservatives mostly in rural communities are also horribly suffering, they can see generation after generation their lifestyles and prospects worsening, and Trump is their version of turning on the system as well....but of course they believe its minorities, free market competition (trade) and advances in position of women in society that's holding them down

So people aren't changing their views as they age in the current environment, they're doubling down"

I also buy into the idea that every so often there's a ""backlash"" where the right throws a collective tantrum over having to play nice and undoes a bunch of progress.

So, two steps forwards, one step back.

That said, in my early 20's I considered myself a Social Democrat and, whereas now I'd call myself a Libertarian Socialist, and I've got to say, Anarcho-Communism isn't looking so bad anymore.

That comment got banned and I was admonished by a moderator for naming them specifically, even in the obviously non-racist context of the comment.

That struck me as stupid, but the only defenses I could have used would have been those abused by the right like 'freedom of speech'. Meanwhile they were treating me in an 'ok boomer' sort of way, like I just wanted the right to use those words, not that the specific words were relevant. I was a leftist being censored by the left!"

They also seem to come from a point of view of ""you're only complaining because you don't have it as good as I do"" as though 1) this is a bad thing, I mean it's a perfectly valid complaint if you're starving and upset about it, while I'm not complaining because I'm well-fed and 2) I AM one of the well-fed, well-off privileged, but I don't have the idea of ""I got mine so fuck you, it's your problem if you don't have it as good as me"" so it's not like that argument makes any sense on any level.

10425,dzhl5l,"So true. There are plenty of old leftists! But they usually engaged with the ideology in some way. Liberals a lot of the time will wander rightward with time as they become more detached from the world. They will drop the leftist views they once had for more convenient reactionary ones. These were never real leftists, only morally lucky. But if the left reaches them before this decline takes hold we get permanent supporters, which is nice"
10426,dzhl5l,"One debunking said that that myth comes from a statistical misinterpretation of survivorship bias. Richer people have better medical care and live longer, and tend to benefit more from conservative policies."

10428,dzhl5l,"I think it’s because the people who say and believe this got richer as they aged, because they lived in an economic climate that allowed them to do so. Their class interests changed as their material conditions improved, and without any actual intellectual understanding of leftist ideology, they swung right."
10429,dzhl5l,"> And it's a myth that people become more conservative as they age, anyway. 

See the idea is that the older you get, the more money and investments you'll have when you're older, so naturally, you'd be conservative and want taxes slashed on everything in sight so you can have moar money.

Except they don't realize that they've done so well at fucking people over that the generations younger than them will never be able to retire, and most people are now living paycheque to paycheque, so all it's doing is making people angry at conservatives who are hoarding everything!"

10432,dzhl5l,"I think, from the 60s to the 90s, liberalism stimulated the economy, engendering capitalism, which in turn promoted conservatism. For us, they done run out of capitalism, which makes us more left as we age and find out that there's no more capitalism for us at the capitalism place.

We just need enough people to not try and make more capitalism for the next generation to run out of."
10433,dzhl5l,"Goodness there is no rush for you. I would recommend for to start following some leftist YouTubers that strike your fancy. There are enough that I've been watching leftist YouTube for years and I'm still finding new ones all the time. I follow a diversity of leftists, from authoritarians to more liberal types. I'm hesitant to throw out recommendations since there is a lot of friction in big leftist hubs like this as to what is ok and what isn't, but I can message you a massive playlist I created with some of my favourite videos if you want.

Outside of YouTube I consume very little leftist media mostly for lack of energy and time. But I recommend you read Marx's literature as it is fundamental to leftist though and we still ground a lot of our theory in Marx to this day. But starting with reading old fuckin Germans talking about class warfare can be such a joykill.

My most important takeaway here I think is don't worry so much about theory. As long as you keep the interest alive and never believe something ONLY because someone said you should.

Advanced: Read Das Kapital by Marx"
10435,dzhl5l,"My noob comrade, you absolutely have to listen to the podcast Revolutionary Left Radio. I cannot recommend it highly enough, it will cover just so much ground from anarchism to ML, it'll talk about history in leftist movements to goings on right now (some foreign and some goings on here in the US) and it's host Breht is easily one of my favorite hosts of any podcast, the dude has knack for a wonderful mix of commentary and good interviews. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Another natural podcast to listen to is Citations Needed, which will arm you against bullshit media. For humor there's always Chapo Trap house, I also really like Pod Damn America, but for some really fun stuff, there's Behind the Bastards where they talk about all the stuff that's, like, behind all those Bastards you know and loathe, historically and now. Withe Behind the Bastards, I think his reading of his book, the first ep of which is The Eternal Fascist, is a great start and it has Cody Johnston from the wonderful YouTube Some More News on as a guest. Wow I made this break at work long, but there ya go.

  E: sorry, lost track. But yea, if you want theory and history, I can't recommend RevLeft Radio highly enough"
10436,dzhl5l,"Not sure about books off hand.

But I'd suggest from YouTube checking out videos fromInnuendo Studios, PhilosophyTube, Three Arrows, and Shaun. 

Anyone let me know if any of these aren't applicable. 

Also, I cant share this video enough... And im sure you will see it again as ive seen many others link it on here:

[Always a bigger fish](https://youtu.be/agzNANfNlTs) by Innuendo Studios. Talks more about the basis of conservative views, but also about progressive ones and where each view comes from based on fundamental views of the world. 


Here is a wiki on [progressivism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism) which cites its origins and the fundamentals of what it stands for, and im aure has many great references to look into the subject further.

Ive only read a book or two on this subject, and i really wish i had something to recommend. Hopefully someone else does.

10438,dzhl5l,">I don’t think boomers were always nazis. They had the 60’s summer of love and Vietnam War protests.

That's a misconception brought on by pop culture depictions of the era. The hippies and the anti-war crowd were *not* representative of the generation, being only subcultures and movements. Many boomers were just as they are now politically, and distaste for the Vietnam war was not universal.

It's also important to draw a distinction between the anti war activism and the whole Summer of Love thing. I strongly suspect a lot of boomers (especially the white privileged ones) were simply in it for the drugs and sex. Hippies were definitely not leftists by default."
10439,dzhl5l,"They create a false economy to drive people into being poor, to help fuel the need for people in the military. They weren't making enough money like they were during the war (WW2) so they thought they would just start a war, draft citizens into the military, and it would be ""WWII : 2 Profit Boogaloo"". But it didn't go over well, it was a failure. (Vietnam)

So they created a false economy where people are now volunteering in droves just to survive."
10440,dzhl5l,"A big part of that is the fact that the Vietnam War protests didn’t become a massive movement until the draft came about. Most of the boomers back then didn’t give two fucks until *they* or someone *they* know and love might have to go and fight. It was fucking anti draft protests, for e most part they didn’t give a good god damn about the war. So that’s absolutely in keeping with the core ethos of the Me Generation. Abject selfishness dressed up in a thin veneer of some sort of morality."
10441,dzhl5l,"Hippy culture was more hedonistic than politically ""woke"". They grew up post-depression, after the age of IWW unionism and worker organization, and after socialist-inspired New Deal policies saved a failing capitalist system. Things were going well because their forefathers had to die for it, whether that was on the ground against fascists, or at home against massive corporate monopolies. The majority grew up in a better age than their forefathers, and most adopted the ""I just wanna grill"" mentality even when young. If a stereotypical boomer grew up today, they'd be a middle class white gamer who thinks they're oppressed because Mortal Kombat women now have their gazunga taytays and meaty flaps covered up. 


Despite these elements still existing, as a Gen Z, I think and hope we're starting to see the growth of a mentality more similar to that of the great depression era or decades before it. Everybody I know is depressed so that's a start."
10442,dzhl5l,Damn. That makes a lot of sense.
10443,dzhl5l,Sounds like some Romanian revolutionary I haven’t heard about yet.
10444,dzhl5l,"Rock on, comrade :D"
10445,dzhl5l,"Exactly. I wouldn't mind having money, but not in this way where I get to fuck everybody else over. To be like the proverbial boomer from the image you need to be a shit person. Not much more to it, you get rich assholes, you get a fucked up world."
10446,dzhl5l,"I think it's less that they ""go right"" and more that they just stay where they are, and the world around them progressively moves left, so people who would be considered centrist or even left of centre like 50 years ago are more aligned with the right wing now."
10447,dzhl5l,This is why we have Donald Trump. Among many other reasons. But lalala I can’t hear you lalala. Read my tweets.
10448,dzhl5l,Same. Being a boomer that fought reactionaries since the 80s made me go further left.
10449,dzhl5l,"Me to. Closing in on 50 and getting more radical every day.  
To be honest I had a period where I got sucked into the 'immigration debate' and got concerned about the fragility of 'western' values, but I think that was a momentary lapse of reason."
10450,dzhl5l,"Yup. My gramma was a suffragette, that voted socialist in 1920. Dad only voted for one republican,Eisenhower. Im63 now, and farther left than ever."
10451,dzhl5l,"Same. But i blame the current political climate. I hold some vague conservative beliefs in a few instances, but on the whole im a progressive.
The cruelty and hate on the right has pushed me sooo much further left then i really thought I'd end up. Also pushed me into becoming an activist... So there is that."
10452,dzhl5l,Just want to state that I’m not poor and I’ve become more leftist even as my salary has gone up to very comfortable middle class levels.
10453,dzhl5l,"And a lot of them that identify as being former hippies just like to wear tie die too. It's the same shit as punk rock kids buying their clothes at hot topic. The actual activists are a small subset of the broader group identifying with the subculture. 

I know a lot of boomers that fondly talk about being hippies and wear the clothes to theme parties but also their politics is straight up fascism."
10454,dzhl5l,That's also a really good theory. Well said.
10455,dzhl5l,Could explain Biden’s popularity with the olds.
10456,dzhl5l,"OK boomer

As in you are an OK boomer"
10457,dzhl5l,My man
10458,dzhl5l,"Good man. Though I must ask, does it ever grind your gears when people from younger generations go like ""ugh, boomers"" or point at boomers for issues they disagree with, even though a: that's a specific member of the baby boomer generation that existed even when the boomers were the same age as Millenials/Gen-Z and b: you hated their guts then and hate them now, too?"
10459,dzhl5l,"I mean, as an Indian-American who thinks that ""western values"" are pretty important for a better world,  (as in liberal democratic values committed to human rights, freedom of choice, and equity of outcomes, not the BS that right wingers spout as ""Western"") it's important to say that many other people in other non-western countries approve of and support ""Western Values"" too. Many of them move here and other ""Western"" countries precisely *because* they can live in accordance to said values. It's willful ignorance on the people who talk about ""culture"" in the Immigration debate, who just want to say ""they're not white and I don't like that"" in a way that doesn't make people defensive about racism.  


I probably don't need to tell you all this, and you probably have come to the same conclusion yourself, but it's still necessary to scream that from the rooftops whenever someone starts talking to you about ""Western Values and Culture""."
10460,dzhl5l,I wonder if at its base level this is all just a case of good vs evil. I just can’t see how anyone thinks that the current republican ideals stand for anything but evil. Taking people’s health care away? Actively widening the gap between rich and poor? Why are these republicans even allowed to be a party anymore? Why is there so many terrible evil people in this country?
10461,dzhl5l,Same.
10462,dzhl5l,"Me, too."
10463,dzhl5l,"Yup. Though I'd say it's not just about Hot Topic punks, and sometimes more about dealing with outright reactionaries like those former hippies you mentioned. ""Nazi Punks Fuck Off"" was a sentiment for a reason."
10464,dzhl5l,"Most of the punks I've met are really open to left wing politics. I even got to speak with a fairly known singer who is an anarchist. Punk rock in my country was the rock which refused to sell itself to corporations in the early 80', instead we squat buildings and give free food."
10465,dzhl5l,My Boomer parents bought the myth of electability so now despite liking Warren or Sanders policies more are terrified about not supporting Biden cause they are afraid of losing to Trump
10466,dzhl5l,I'll take it!
10467,dzhl5l,"I too was/am pissed off at most boomers because they're entitled neoliberal assholes. In the 80s/90s, when some parts of Canada was being confronted with white supremacists and racist skinheads, most boomers I knew were against any type of fightback or direct action, as they are now.

What I find annoying is there's no real come back to ""OK Boomer"". Any attempt to explain or add context looks weak and is discounted. It works as a good silencer. And I think antifascists need a loud, strong voice."
10468,dzhl5l,"You're absolutely right. If anything, that period of 'doubt' has learned me that it is always possible to educate yourself and change your mind. I came to see that of course it's possible to defend western values not be racist at the same time."
10469,dzhl5l,"No such thing as evil. It's about values and morals. What do you value? If its self advancment reinforced by constantly being told you are gods gift, never being told no, and that the poors and browns want to take what is rightfully yours..... Welp... Your not evil, you just have a really fcked up view of the world.

Although Mitch McConnell really makes me question my belief that people don't think of themselves as evil.... I truly think that man does and enjoys it."
10470,dzhl5l,I go to a lot of gigs across a lot of genres and punk always has the nicest crowds
10471,dzhl5l,"I think that’s universal across the real punk scene everywhere, but the difference between someone in a real punk band and a highschool fan of a pop punk band that goes to hot topic is pretty big."
10472,dzhl5l,"Yeah, neoliberalism as a political ideology is horrific. I do think that many people, at least in their heads, couple the hippies and student activists/protestors with the present-day neolib boomers, without realizing that those groups were different then. Maybe the neolib boomers (at least for us in the USA) were apolitical, or at least center-right during the 1960's-1970's, when many came of age. However, these aren't the same people as the flower children or the anti-vietnam and civil-rights protestors. The neolib boomers came to prominence, or at least presented themselves the way that they did when Reagan came to power in the 1980's in the USA.  


As a person living in the country that's Canada's Beard, I don't know much about the political scene up there during the mid to late 20th Century, but I imagine that there are a lot of parallels."
10473,dzhl5l,"I’m gonna go ahead and also say OK, boomer. Also in the context that you’re an okay boomer. Thank you!"
10474,dzhl5l,">a high school fan of pop punk band that goes to hot topic is pretty big. 

Wow you just described my high school self perfectly."
10475,dzhl5l,"lol same, I think a lot of us started in that boat tbh."

10540,gfa0m4,"> It is KIND of impossible to showboat your rights IMO

Those bastards murdered a man on camera in broad daylight and the only reason that they're facing any retribution is because the video of a man being hunted and gunned down in the street was leaked onto the Internet, where it has been subsequently viewed by millions of people across the world *but despite all of that*, there is still no guarantee that those fucking scumbags will actually face any measurable amount of justice.

Look me in the screen and tell me that that isn't showboating rights."
10541,gfa0m4,"That's what I thought out of the context. If you have rights you also have the right to exercise them as long as there is no law specifically barring you from doing so for good reasons.

Since I don't really see why Black people should be specifically restricted in their freedom of movement compared to white people those two racist fucknuggets can unkindly fuck opff and spend the rest of their days in jail. And if the local state attorney refuses to do his job, make a case and press charges against them he should join them in for complicity.

Edit: Would you look at that. That woman is the wife of the well-known Austrian nazi ""Martin Sellner"" xD"
10572,hh03z9,"Well, we all know that Turkey has a very long history of tolerance and totally hasn't done anything that could be considered fascist. 

Nope, can't think of a single thing.  
Not one."
10573,hh03z9,"That honestly sounds badass of Austrian antifascists! Austrian brand fascists? Punch! Turkish brand fascists? Punch! 
If they fash, you bash, no exceptions."
10574,hh03z9,"I am Muslim and anti-fascist. 

If the Nazis hate it, it’s probably a good thing."
10575,hh03z9,Is this satire or is this a moron?
10576,hh03z9,"guess what, I also hate jewish fascists"
10577,hh03z9,not to get all armenian about this or anything but thanks antifa
10578,hh03z9,Wait until she finds out what antifa did to ISIS.
10579,hh03z9,"There is no such thing as a \[Insert Tag Here\] Fascist. Once someone has dedicated themselves to fascism, whatever other thing they were also attempting to be dies with it. It doesn't matter if a fascist is holding a Bible, a Quran, the Vedas, a constitution, or a fucking dictionary. It's like painting a nuclear bomb blue and expecting it to act differently then one that's painted red. Fascists are dishonest, sociopathic liars. The only reason they're using \[Insert Tag Here\] is to draw others into their fascist bullshit."
10580,hh03z9,If anyone is [curious](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Wolves_(organization))... Real stand up folks on all levels. Totally sound like folks you should defend /s
10581,hh03z9,"AFAB 
All fascists are bastards"
10582,hh03z9,Turkish nationalism has been on the rise since October of last year. Still hate 'em.
10583,hh03z9,"You mean that we dislike fascist without caring about their religion ethnicity age or so said gender, who would now"
10584,hh03z9,They ARE Turkish fascists
10585,hh03z9,"I don't understand why Turkish-nationalists don't go to Turkey, if they are so proud of it"
10586,hh03z9,"As it happens, I don’t like Idi Amin or Robert Mugabe either. Also not a big fan of Erdogan, Orbán, Duterte, Bolsanaro, or Vlad fucking Putin. Maybe I just don’t like shitty people. Maybe I don’t like genocide or barbarism no matter who’s committing it. It’s one of the few things I’m pretty dogmatic about."
10587,hh03z9,"It's almost like Islam isn't a monolith, like most large religions"
10588,hh03z9,Yes I’m going to Austria right now. might join in
10589,hh03z9,"So much for the tolerant left

Edit. JESUS. 

#/S"
10590,hh03z9,Why do conservatives think it’s like the most badass thing in the world to fight Islamic fundamentalists but then get all weird about it when antifa does it?
10591,hh03z9,"Yeah I'm Turkish. These ""Grey Wolves"" or ""Bozkurt"" are literally saying 
1. that the Armenians deserved it.
2. The Turkish nation should stretch out all the way from Bulgaria to Siberia because those lands were initially inhabited by Turks. İt's called [turanism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turanism). 
3. The original thought of the Grey Wolves was that the Turks national religion was shamanism, but now that turkey is governed by a islamist dude they now think Islam is their national religion.

So in conclusion they can't even do fascism correctly. THEY CAN'T CORRECTLY BE FASCİSTS. smh this is so sad.."
10592,hh03z9,"""Omg how can they call Muslims fascist?? MUSLIMS? HOW CAN BROWN PPL BE BAD???? XD""

Is she literally doing what she accuses 'the left' of doing? How is it a bad thing that we oppose fascism from wherever it lurks?"
10593,hh03z9,Well I mean ever heard of the arrow cross party? Or the Bosnians who fought for the fuhrer? Believe it or not there is a Mexican fascist party and even a Lebanese falangisg party
10594,hh03z9,"Antifascists battle fascists, more at 9"
10595,hh03z9,"Imagine being as stupid as her.

I'm having so much trouble right now, and I'm not exactly a genius over here"
10596,hh03z9,"Thanks for pointing out that Antifa is anti-fascist, no exceptions."
10597,hh03z9,I’m so confused. Is ANTIFA bad for disliking fascism?
10598,hh03z9,"Who would have thunk, Antifa battling fascists!"
10599,hh03z9,"I like how she finds it crazy that Antifa is calling the Grey Wolves fascists, like how exclusive of a definition of fascism excludes the fucking Grey Wolves."
10600,hh03z9,LOL
10601,hh03z9,Vienne la rouge !
10602,hh03z9,"Uh thats cause the grey wolves are a old fascist hearth group, go figure. I gotta imagine that antifa doesn't like the felagist fascists or bashir either, at least that's what the impression that I got at all our spooky antifa meetings ( I'm being fascicious, not fascist lol)"
10603,hh03z9,It’s almost as if militant religious extremism on all fronts is the enemy of anyone who fights fascism
10604,hh03z9,"Sounds pretty inclusive to me, honestly.  Why exclude one set of fascists from your set of political opposition?"
10605,hh03z9,"They don't discriminate based on religion or ethnicity, just on whether your ideology is a danger to society"
10606,hh03z9,"By its definition, Islam is a fascist power structure. That goes for most organised religions though."
10607,hh03z9,"I'm confused here. Is OP saying they should unconditionally support Muslims? Or that Antifa are the real Islamophobes? Or are they actually supportive? Twitter is terrible and all I ever see shared here is people pushing a weird agenda, so I don't even know what to make of this."
10608,hh03z9,"They aren’t just “muslims”, Islam is not even what they are really about. The grey wolves are a fascist, turk-supremacist organization."
10609,hh03z9,It’s a similar tactic RWNJs used when Macron beat Le Pen and they went all “Oh I thought you wanted women to win elections?”
10610,hh03z9,BREAKING NEWS!:Polish anti-fascists are riding into Vienna dressed as winged hussars!
10611,hh03z9,Turkish nationalists in Austria? Good lord....
10612,hh03z9,We beat up the grey wolves in sweden as well.
10613,hh03z9,AnTiFa iZ raCiSt!!1!
10614,hh03z9,I can't believe you hate bad people regardless of where they're from!
10615,hh03z9,"I live in Austria and I can verify that the Grey wolves group is indeed faschistic motivated. [Here is the news snipped (in German) ](https://kurier.at/chronik/wien/graue-woelfe-gegen-linke-erneut-ausschreitungen-in-favoriten/400954298)

The lady in the tweet has no idea what she is talking about."
10616,hh03z9,"They cannot fathom any middle ground between ""all muslims are bad people"" and ""all muslims are good people"". They take the former stance, obviously, and because they can't help but project their way of thinking onto everybody, they assume we hold the latter stance just because we oppose their bigotry."
10617,hh03z9,What’s with fascists and having really edgy names
10618,hh03z9,BREAKING: Anti Fascists fight against fascists
10619,hh03z9,lol this lady is literally a white nationalist.
10620,hh03z9,Only a hypocrite behaves so consistently. The Right believes this unironically.
10621,hh03z9,"Dude I love it. On one hand we're so obsessed with race that we only think white people are bad and able to do a fascism and would never DARE say shit about any other ethnic group, but on the other we're the real racists just because we don't think that Muslim and Jewish ethno staters are good either. Like bitch make up your mind"
10622,hh03z9,Well the Turkish government loves genocide so they’re probably fascists
10623,hh03z9,"Oh for fucks sake...

So here's the deal, from someone who actually lives within walking distance of the ""battle"":  


1. The Grey Wolves is a fascist political organization from Turkey - even wikipedia calls them ""far-right ultranationalist""...aka, fascist.
2. This group attacked a rally for women's rights and Kurdistan on June 24, and there have been violent but relatively non-destructive clashes between fascist groups and leftist activists since then. 
3. The initial attack took place by EKH, the Ernst Kirchweger Haus, which is an anti-fascist social centre that provides resources and shelter for marginalized people and leftists in Vienna.
4. The EKH gave a statement about the events on their webpage, where there is an English translation: [https://med-user.net/\~ekh/](https://med-user.net/~ekh/)
5. Of course fascists can be muslim...?"
10624,hh03z9,It’s almost as if Antifa opposes *all* forms of fascism.
10625,hh03z9,Anyone can be a fascist
10626,hh03z9,What do these trolls think they are accomplishing?
10627,hh03z9,"""grey wolves"" are nothing but turkish identitarians and nazis were always allies of islamic nationalism"
10628,hh03z9,"oh, I overlooked this post...was just posting about this conflict because I thought nobody mentioned it"
10629,hh03z9,This kind of worldview is really next level delusional
10630,hh03z9,A battle ? Ok it was like literally a handful of moronic turkish nationalist erdogan balls licker that live in Germany. I can say that because my parents are turkish and I live in germany. Our police is really well trained and deescalated the situation immediately.
10631,hh03z9,"Austrian here: It's definitely not a ""Battle"". It's three protests (Us, the grey wolves, and our own fascists) seperated by the police. There have been some violent outbreaks around one of our centers of operation, and the Turkish Embassy, both of which are now protected/locked down by police."
10632,hh03z9,I would guess AntiFa are pro-Kurd because of the PKK (Kurdish Workers Party- communist insurgency in Turkey/Iraq/Iran).
10633,hh03z9,"Its amazing how when the strawman is disproven, they take it as the strawman being a hypocrite for not being a strawman"
10634,hh03z9,I don’t understand. What’s her point?
10635,hh03z9,"Hello, Turk here. This is lit, can confirm."
10636,hh03z9,"Dude, Islam is not a fucking western philosophy. This shit doesn't fit with western egalitarianism, the Quran legit says I (and many like me) need to be put to death. Fuck that, fuck the Quran and fuck traditional Islamic practice. Hate the church, not the member."
10637,hh03z9,It took me less than 5 minutes on Google to realize this is a trash person.
10638,hh03z9,"It doesn’t matter what ethnicity or religion you are. If you are a fascist, you are a fascist. They are far right, ultranationalist, xenophobic and racist"
10639,hh03z9,"the grey wolves are a far-right ultranationalist group. this has nothing to do with antifa's stance on islam, this has everything to do with antifa's stance on religious extremism."
10640,hh03z9,You know somebody is a white nationalist when they assosiate nationalism with whiteness
10641,hh03z9,muslims are known to hate jews so i don’t know why this is weird to you
10642,hh03z9,Who is Britney Seller and why do we care
10643,hh03z9,"“Oh wait, this Fascist is a Muslim. Let’s go boys, this one is okay.”"
10644,hh03z9,Why the fuck are the Grey Wolves in Vienna lmao
10645,hh03z9,"She complained that ANTIFA were fighting against the direct result of ANTIFA’s policy on open borders, which is dumb on so many levels. The only qualifier to be an anti-fascist is to be against fascism. Your policy on open borders has no direct effect on your ability to br an anti-fascist. And even if you assumed people in ANTIFA generally support open borders, I know no communist/anarchist that advocates for open borders under liberalism."
10646,hh03z9,"fr tho, I hope they beat those grey wolf scum into dust. and grey wolves arent islamist extremists, some of them arent even muslim, they are TURKISH fascists"
10647,hh03z9,"Fascist stupidness can't amaze me anymore. Anyone with some neurons know that the Grey Wolves are fucking fascists! 

What we do here?! SMASH FASCISM!"
10648,hh03z9,"Brittany Sellner...

Where did I hear the name Sellner before...

Oh that's right! One of the biggest fascist pricks in Europe is her Husband."
10649,hh03z9,"Fashies: “Hurr durr Antifa hates whites”
Antifa: *fights fashies of all colors and creeds*
Fashies: “You weren’t supposed to do that”"
10650,hh03z9,"Bash the fash, no matter who they are"
10651,hh03z9,Do conservatives think only white people can be fascist? Are they pulling the race card
10652,hh03z9,Maybe Antifa isn’t about disliking fascists after all. Maybe it’s the friends we made along the way
10653,hh03z9,hope they kill each other
10654,hh03z9,"Wait, why are Turkish nationalists in Vienna, the capital  of Austria."
10655,hh03z9,Fuck Antifa
10656,hh03z9,Inconceivable.
10657,hh03z9,"Well they should make it more obvious, maybe put it in the name or something."
10658,hh03z9,"Wait, whaaaaat?"
10659,hh03z9,It’s a good job I was sitting down when I read that revelation.
10660,hh03z9,"And that ""Muslims"" are not a coherent group. Half the Antifa fighting the Grey Wolves are probably ""Muslims"" as in left wing people of turkish or kurdish origin"
10661,hh03z9,half the damn people I talk to don't even know what a fascist IS
10662,hh03z9,"Yeah, an ethnostate is an ethnostate, regardless of if it is white, black, Muslim, or even Jewish (looking at you Israel)."
10663,hh03z9,"They have a rigid definition of fascism that only contains Nazis. They fail to understand the concept of fascism.

It’s like how they don’t perceive Muslims as being predominantly conservative."
10664,hh03z9,"""Fox news told me antifa want to install sharia law! Yet they fight far right muslims? Who am I meant to believe!?"""
10665,hh03z9,"I wouldn't say someone like Brittany Sellner struggles to grasp this, she's just pushing her ""Antifascists are the REAL nazis""-narrative here."
10666,hh03z9,It makes sense for them: they believe that we all just hate white people.
10667,hh03z9,"Thats because when they hear ""Turkish nationalists"" they focus on a different part than antifascists do"
10668,hh03z9,"Obligatory ""I'm no fan of antifa"" preface - but I do follow what y'all say and do because I don't think it's right that anyone malign you.

I try to clarify your position to my right-wing friends and it's always the same ""No, you're antifa"" - why? Because I can articulate your position or describe/explain your actions?

They have a seriously vested interest in staying as ignorant of you as possible. It's as if I'm interrupting their false narrative.

Because I'm not one of you, I clearly state I'm not one of you, and I openly critique you, it really fucks with them to have someone correct them about what you are and what you do. 

So just keep in mind, it isn't that they aren't capable of understanding. It's that they want to define who you are and what you stand for based on their own propaganda. It's not stupidity. It's carefully crafted ignorance."
10669,hh03z9,"Aren't there like 1.5 billion Muslims or something like that? They can recogniz how the 1 billion or whatever Christians are all different, but not the brown people."
10670,hh03z9,"The right wing says we only engage in ""identity politics"", when they are the ones most wedded to it."
10671,hh03z9,"They are jealous, they thought they had us only for themselves"
10672,hh03z9,They can’t they just really really can’t grasp that they’re the baddies. They have been fed ‘conservative good liburl bad’ for so long they just can’t fathom they’ve been radicalized and are now advocating for and defending the antithesis of freedom.
10673,hh03z9,"The right wing is incapable of critical thought, otherwise they wouldn't be right wing. Any mental process straying from fear and bootthroating is even more scary than the existence of people whose worldview is based on love for the other"
10674,hh03z9,"They believe their own PR about the Left scheming with ""Non Whites"" to conquer ""the western world""

Because the Right is dumb as shit"
10675,hh03z9,The ignorance is astounding. I’m literally not surprised anymore.
10676,hh03z9,"They so used to white fascists, that anti-fascim for them just means anti-white"
10677,hh03z9,The Dutch government actually called in the Grey Wolves to help with integrating Turkish immigrants. It was so bone-headed a Turkish Dutchman went on television and said it was like trying to integrate Dutch people with the help of the Dutch nazi party.
10678,hh03z9,They are no joke. A friend of my sister is from Turkey. Her father is a Grey Wolf. She had to essentially break of any contact to that part of her family because her father started threatening her and her boyfriend when she dated a Kurd.

10689,hh03z9,"idk why I chose the route of trying to think of an exception to this, but: America and Israel. ya i know you said ""probably"". i was just bored, sorry."
10690,hh03z9,"Neither. It's deliberate misinformation. She's the wife of Martin Sellner, an Austrian Nazi."
10691,hh03z9,Unfortunately it's real.
10692,hh03z9,Imagine that person's head exploding when they find out antifa Jews are anti-Zionists.
10693,hh03z9,Since we're on Reddit my first instinct was to clarify/make sure your emphasis was on the fascist part and not the jewish one but since we're on this lovely unique sub hopefully that's obvious to everyone else...
10694,hh03z9,Yo I'm a turk and even the ultra islamists don't like these grey Wolves lol. Fucking fascists.
10695,hh03z9,im half azeri half kurdish and whenever turkish fascists accuse me of being kurdish and stupid (etc) I just pull my personal uno reverse card and they get mad almost every time.

10697,hh03z9,"That reminds me of a New Yorker piece from 1901 (or 1910 or 1911?). Two cops were beating up some guys when they were surrounded by a crowd who was having none of it. One of the cops cried out to the crowd, ""I'm an Irishman like you!""

And one of the crowd answered back, ""When an Irishman becomes a cop, he's no longer an Irishman, he's a cop."""
10698,hh03z9,"I mean you have a point but it's also worth noting that religious, political, and ethical texts can contain various degrees of fascistic rhetoric within them and ignoring the fact that certain types of worldviews foster fascism much better than others can be a pretty bad idea."
10699,hh03z9,"""There are very fine people on both sides"" xD"
10700,hh03z9,I like this more the ACAB
10701,hh03z9,Only then? Didn't Erdogan use nationalist sentiment a few years ago to expand his power with a referendum?
10702,hh03z9,I KNOW RİGHT?? I'm Turkish and there are more nationalists and islamists outside of turkey THAN IN TURKEY. I think it's because they have no clue how fucked turkey is right now.

This made me laugh"
10704,hh03z9,Liberals are actually more noted for their tolerance than leftists are. Most leftists will gladly point out the things they are intolerant of. Fascism is one of those things. Intolerance is not inherently bad nor is tolerance inherently good.
10705,hh03z9,"Here in Brazil we have some Latin Nazis. Several times one of those groups tried to get close to European Nazis and got ""fuck off, untermensch"" as answer. We call them White Pardos, ""pardos"" being a word for mixed race people."
10706,hh03z9,The propaganda being peddled around at the monent against antifascists is getting very fucking irritating. It's like they have millions of dumb fuckers on the Internet constantly. American media certainly doesn't help and unfortunately there are many gullible people out there that believe everything they read.
10707,hh03z9,Miss sellner here is trying to act surprised that Antifscists attack Muslims since in a  rightwing worldview antifa is so pro islam after all
10708,hh03z9,Grey wolves are (sadly) common everywhere with a significant Turkish population.
10709,hh03z9,Ottomans reincarnate of course what else.
10710,hh03z9,Germany and Vienna have a very sizeable turkish minority
10711,hh03z9,"The Grey Wolves are present everywhere the turkish diaspora exists, so most of europe.   
Turkey has a lot of control over the diaspora : organising propaganda camps for children, kidnapping of dissidents, threats, etc and probably support for the Grey Wolves    
Basically even after leaving Turkey it's still dangerous for dissidents to speak against Erdoghan.     
Thankfully the Kurdish diaspora from turkey is equally organised"
10712,hh03z9,There is a mayor ban to sell guns to turkey so they are probably protesting that
10713,hh03z9,idk why ur downvoted lmao. the answer is that cancer can spread randomly and theres only one way to kill it
10714,hh03z9,How brave
10715,hh03z9,"Just be safe, sane, and consensual!"
10716,hh03z9,"""fuck people who are against fascism"""

10718,hh03z9,"If we're quoting movies here.

My name is Inigo Montoya, fascists killed my father. Prepare to die."

10721,hh03z9,"Yeah, this whole thing started because the Turkish fascists attacked a Kurdish women's demonstration. Antifa came to support their Kurdish comrades, and soon later the Turkish fascists attacked the EKH, Vienna's oldest and most famous squat."

10727,hh03z9,"Not every ethnostate is fascist though.

Edit: why the downvotes? Fascism is a pretty specific idea, and not everything nationalist and authoritarian is fascist. Go read Umberto Eco or Thomas Mann or something.

I feel like a chud for saying ""not everything you disagree with is fascism"" but it's kind of appropriate here. There's more in the realm of fucked up thinking than fascism."
10728,hh03z9,Half the time they don't even include Nazis. They insist they were actually socialists. BeCaUsE tHe NaMe!!!!!!!
10729,hh03z9,Not even just Nazis. Only the WW2 Nazis. Every other Nazi is fake and aren't actually Nazis. They're just larping apparently.
10730,hh03z9,"Yeah, I was being facetious and generalised a bit - it's just a strong trend I've noticed among the people commenting on the whole thing."
10731,hh03z9,"Oh, I'm absolutely aware - especially for the figures in more prominent roles, that is certainly the case. 

I still see quite a few 'regular' right-wingers who seemed genuinely offended and weirded out by the idea that these attacks by Turks (or, more correctly, Austrians with a Turkish background) were called 'right wing'  - and I do think they didn't gave it enough thought not to actually mean it."
10732,hh03z9,"I feel like the whole ""not one of you"" thing is part of the problem. Anyone with any actual compassion for other people is antifa when you get down to it.  The right wing has been led to believe that AnTiFa is some gang or group with membership and meetings, but it's literally just being against fascism."
10733,hh03z9,Weren't the grey wolves also literally smuggling heroine into Netherlands?(I know they were in Germany but I assume their operations reached more than just there)
10734,hh03z9,Yea one of my school friend's dad is a grey wolf apparently and he forced her to go to his meetings and shit it's creepy af

But he shares the same lawyer with Austria's former minister of interior, and the last times cops searched his house he got actual phonecalls they were about to knock at his door. This man got friends in high places, which is not really surprising considering Austria's far right party was part of the government until not long ago."

10787,hh03z9,"Two things. The less familiar you are with something, the more homogeneous your mind is going to treat that thing. Its through knowledge that you recognize the nuance, whether its a subject of study, a group of people or whatever else. So I think that's an important aspect to be aware of.

The other, is that we have elites and systems in place encouraging that thought process of homogenizing things. Reporting, politicians speaking, etc. You only have so much time for news/fact checking/learning. And if you appeal to authority (a common psychological attribute of those that lean right) you are going to accept and reinforce that world view made simplified.

So, there is a natural psychological tendency that is then reinforced. Two other big ones being hate (I would use tribalism) and fear, that ng362 mentioned. And you can look to Trump's twitter feed basically any day of the week to see those being used. But again, its a psychological tendency and it is exploited across the political spectrum but more commonly and effectively by the right due to a susceptibility, I would imagine, for those sorts of political leanings.

I've been reading a bunch about oppression in language tonight so sorry for the sorta aimless rant."

But idk, if you're having the choice between calling the cops and getting beaten to pulp, it's okay to call the cops at a last resort. Most of the time, they  probably will still be as unhelpful as they're racist, tho.

Unfortunately I no longer have access to journals, so a lot of the scholarly google searches were just reading abstracts."
10810,hh03z9,"Ok, honest question, is it? I never heard it in a racial context. But English isn’t my first language. Is it often used in a racial context?"
10811,hh03z9,We can't reach such conclusions by looking at election results in capitalist democracies. Large part of the working class don't vote due to apathy. Minorities and workers have a harder time voting in many countries. Then in some countries there are gerrymandering and other types of election manipulation. And all that is on top of the ideological indoctrination. So you can't just say that the people as whole or even the majority are right or far right.
10812,hh03z9,"The government is a coalition of right to far right parties, voted in with a slim majority."
10813,hh03z9,"And what’s wrong about there being a Jewish homeland there? It can be Jewish, yet diverse and heterogenous."
10814,hh03z9,Not really. I only see it used to mock turks when they claim to be victims as response to Armenian genocide.
10815,hh03z9,"Yes, mostly on /pol/."
10816,hh03z9,"Election day in Israel is a federal holiday. Those who work in essential functions and can't vote while the voting stations are open can vote after they closed (requires a bit of bureaucracy).

And apathy towards a fascist government that actively works to oppress another group isn't any better."
10817,hh03z9,Which still means the majority of the population is voting either for fascists or those who ally with fascist.
10818,hh03z9,"Tell that to the Zionists. There were already people living in Palestine and the Zionists at that point didn’t want to live in a diverse and heterogenous homeland! It was an ethnonationalist project; they wanted all the land to themselves and immediately sent armed militias to displace the Palestinian people there once they were allowed to settle there. 

Frankly, I find it a little disturbing that someone on an anti fascist subreddit doesn’t understand the nature of Zionism as an ethnonationalist ideology or how it became the colonial project that it’s been for most of it’s history."
10819,hh03z9,The government is not fascist though. It doesn’t even meet the basic criteria for that.
10820,hh03z9,Guess it ain’t different to most Western democracies then.
10821,hh03z9,"I find it disturbing that someone here fails to comprehend the heterogeneity of some movements.

Sure, one can go around saying that “Zionism=bad” but there is more to the creation of Israel than the displacement of Palestinians. There were tensions there that started with the British mandate, which were not at all one-sided. Native Jews and native Arabs did not coexist as peacefully as one might have hoped.

And once again, I remind you of the fact that Palestine did not use its chance to proclaim statehood in 1948, instead hoping to eradicate the new state. 

This isn’t black and white. It’s a complex situation with no clear way out."
10822,hh03z9,"I acknowledge that yes, there were different strands of Zionism and that yes, some of them were socialist and probably progressive, but you need to look more closely at the modern day. All those different flavors of Zionism have died off one by one because there is one version that actually happened; the one where the Jewish State is really an *exclusively* Jewish state where any minorities are reduced to second class citizens and the Palestinian people that were already living there were and still are forced off their land and living under military occupation! 

I implore you to do some more research on the actual history and understand why “Socialist Zionism” makes about as much sense as “National Socialism”."

I know two things: I have been given an incredibly easy path through life, guaranteeing me success if I want it. The second is that if I do not use that trajectory I have in order to help the world as much as goddamn possible, that head start will have been wasted. My purpose in life is to use my privilege to help others however much I can, and that drive has overridden suicidal tendencies. Leftism provided me a purpose for living, which personally was enough"

10904,dlvgs6,Hopelessness is a huge problem. The propaganda of the States with its cult of individuality isolates people. The divide-and-conquer strategy further enhances this. And the images of the all powerful State intimidates. Always remember you are not alone millions and millions feel and want change. Find those people and unite. Agree to disagree and work with the similarity you have with people. And all empires like Rome have collapsed. There was a time when a woman going to school would be an outrageous idea. Freeing slaves was insane if you told anyone. McCarthyism brought immense fear on many dissidents. They always fall faster than it took to build those things up.

10929,dlvgs6,"Hang in there, comrade."
10930,dlvgs6,"agree 100% and since i feel this is going to be a controversial comment i'm gonna ride on your coattails.

someone considering suicide is in a really bad place mentally. they might be prone to misinterpreting the good intent behind the graphic. they might twist it around and feel even worse about themselves. after all, a suicidal person is right on the knife edge and is considering ""letting the fascists win."" (worst fucking take on suicide i've ever read)

so basically now a really mentally ill person has this thought in their head that on top of everything, now people might think they're a bad person because they're thinking about LETTING THE FASCISTS WIN.

And it's not logical but that could just well send them over the edge and lead them to off themselves, because suicide's not really a logical process.

fight suicide by increasing the resources available to people to cope and helping give them reasons to live. Don't ever make it a duty based you owe the world something because even if you don't mean to it will provoke guilt and make things worse.

Spending time in leftist spaces has helped a ton and taught me some stuff.  The ppl there are patient with me and take my needs, emotions into account. I feel heard, I feel seen for a chance. I learned to be more aware of my own and other people’s needs and to be more patient.

edit: spelling"
10946,dlvgs6,"I think you're right but I think this meme is kinda like a glimpse into someone's internal self-talk. Like I'm suicidal and sometimes it feels like the only thing keeping me alive is spite toward terfs and fascists. I've had a lot of thoughts like this. I can't afford therapy or medication but at least I can be happy that I'm continuing to survive even though a lot of people want me to disappear. 

(although I agree that it could use a content warning lol. it's a bit early for this)"
10947,dlvgs6,"I have to very much disagree. As someone actually contemplating suicide on and off again, I actually really like this meme. Might even print it out and tack it up somewhere. Makes me more determined not to off myself. In my experience spite is a great motivator. 

Sure, the mentally ill aren't monolithic but a blanket condemnation of this post doesn't think of everyone who this might genuinely be supported by this."
10948,dlvgs6,"when you hate yourself so much you wanna die, finding something that you hate so much that you wanna live can be helpful. it’s not about “duty,” it’s about redirecting your negative feelings toward something that deserves it.

What is the possible good outcome of this? Someone whos contemplating suicide sees this and thinks ""oh, thats right, why was I even sad?""."

10958,dlvgs6,"As a currently ""in a very bad place"" person, I find the reminder that I do hate the followers of a certain ideology more than I hate myself right now to be some what encouraging. For whatever that's worth.

I'm not speaking over suicidal people, I am suicidal people and it's problematic even if it doesn't harm you personally. My point was never that suicidal folks are a monolithic bloc but that doing this presents needless risks and can actually make the situation worse.

Just a few months ago someone else who I knew well also comitted suicide. I know this meme isn't going to convince someone who actually wants to commit suicide but it won't do any harm either. There are a lot of people with suicidal thoughts who most likely won't do it, this might help them."

I'm not exaggerating.  There are a lot of far-righters that believe this.

You got any proof of that besides a picture of people standing still?

Calling yourself a nationalist is worse than actually beating someone up for expressing their opinion?

Literally everyone knows about how right wing provocateurs do this. You're the one who needs to support their claim with facts.

>Calling yourself a nationalist is worse than actually beating someone up for expressing their opinion? 

Yes. Especially if the opinion is ""certain groups of people are subhuman."" We had two wars about this. The whole world was involved. Nobody has to listen to their shit anymore. The ""discussion"" is over everyone knows it. Now is where you choose sides. If you're trying to gaslight people into believing they're morally obligated to non violence and appeals to ethnofascists' humanity, you've chosen your side. Whether you'll admit it to yourself and others or not.

>Can we at least agree that physically attacking someone for expressing their opinion is bad and shouldn’t be done?

Juvenile absolutist nonsense that completely disregards that American jurisprudence has tons of precepts about verbal aggression, provocation and escalation. Also a sad attempt at apples to oranges. ""I don't care for dubstep"" is an opinion, ""certain groups of people are subhuman and deserve to be cleansed"" = incitement, assault, death threats, there's like a million justifications there for a violent response and I doubt any jury of your peers in the world would convict you."
11111,g30at8,"> Oh no not a typo that I immediately corrected. I guess my entire argument is invalid.

I was making fun of you. It was one of multiple things I said to you.

> You got any proof of that besides a picture of people standing still? 

Yes. The picture where he's actively attacking a group of protesters which was literally the first pic, the other showing him with his fists up ready to fight.

> Calling yourself a nationalist is worse than actually beating someone up for expressing their opinion? 

Not the point and no I didn't say that. Like I pointed out he wasn't attacked because he expressed his opinion. You're being insincere right now.

> Can we at least agree that physically attacking someone for expressing their opinion is bad and shouldn’t be done? 

Yes. But that's not what happened."
11112,g30at8,"I don’t see the relevance this has to America. It says unlimited tolerance, which doesn’t currently exist. We don’t tolerate threats of violence, murder, or pedophilia for example. 

By tolerate does it mean society must cast out intolerant ideas or that there has to be legislation to enforce it? There are many legal ideals that society overall doesn’t tolerate such as Nazis. 

If you want to base policy off that idea how do you apply it? Who decides how tolerant we need to be, president Trump? What’s perfectly tolerable for one may be unacceptable for another."
11113,g30at8,"You’re again moving the argument. This started because you asked, quite simply, why use a bike lock to hit a nazi. And why shouldn’t we tolerate nazi ideas instead of attacking them.

Of course its extremely important for the ""subaltern"", be it for emancipation, identity or special programs. But the discourse still reproduces oppressive terminology and keeps it relevant. Race seems to be a reality, every citizens has to be one of the chosen six races and clearly he shares the races own traits too.

To further this fascism always paints ""its group"" as the hard done by victim and ties up an individuals self esteem into the greater glory and achievments of the group.

My previous example was a simile (look up the term if it's too nebulous for you I'm not your god damn dictionary), an example of the logical inconsistency inherent of opposing fascism while being fine with other non-fascist authoritarian regimes. I could have also used other example like being against Franco's fascist dictatorial regime in Spain but being fine with the dictatorship of Al Assad in Syria, either all dictatorial regime are bad or none of them are bad, you can't pick and choose your dictator and sort them as bad or not bad depending on their ideological bent.

You see the logic I'm going for, maybe not. Let's try this way, off course all genocide are bad, but if you refuse to condemn non-fascist authoritarian regime as much as fascist regime, one clearly idiotic very hypothetical person could eventually make the case that non-fascist genocide are not as bad as genocide committed by fascist regime. 

If you are into math, set theory (again google it if you don't know what this is) is relevant to this. Let say we have set A and B, B being a subset of A, say A is the set of all odd numbers and B is the set of all the odd numbers divisible by 3, if we come to the conclusion that all the elements of A are not divisible by 2 (this is an easy proof to do at an elementary level), then because B is a subset of A and all the elements of B are in A we must conclude that all the elements of B are also not divisible by 2.

Well here's somewhere we disagree. Reality is complex and you need to assess situations in light of those complexities. Logical word math abstracted from material realities is not useful in figuring out a correct left orientation. The crude cheerleading some MLs do for Assad based on the idea ""he's against the US and Israel therefore he's our man go Assad"" is incorrect but just as incorrect is an approach that abstracts analysis of Assad from the realities of US imperialism, Israeli aggression, Saudi proxy reaction and Syrian national development /self determination.

A nazi was a member of the national socialist workers party or germany in the 1930s/40s. The nazis are all dead or so old they might as well be dead.

You all, I assume, are referring to neo-nazis. 

It's not surprising that the uneducated on both sides wouldnt know the difference. The most relevant distinction here would be that actual nazis would have murdered Americans since they were a nationalist movement and... well... americans arent ethnic germans. If that wasnt clear, dont feel bad. The neo-nazi retards that use Hitler's rhetoric and/or symbolism are too dumb to realize they are worshipping a man that would have murdered them.

11620,ek4mey,"Agreeing that fascists deserve free speech does not make you a fascist; it only makes you a liberal.

Fascists in Italy Spain & Germany capitalized on the political rights given them under the liberal republican forms that they would eventually destroy.

Even while they benefited from speech & assembly rights, their rhetoric was explicitly anti-liberal (anti-syndicalist for DeRivera). It was always full of lies, hate & the promise to revoke the very rights that allowed them to come to power. Fascists literally could not achieve political relevance without the right to lie & scare people, destabilizing society.

Fascist speech is equivalent to yelling ""Fire!"" in the crowded political theater of a liberal constitutional republic.

[Just world fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis)

>The just-world hypothesis or just-world fallacy is the cognitive bias (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic justice, destiny, divine providence, desert, stability, and/or order, and is often associated with a variety of fundamental fallacies, especially in regard to rationalizing people's suffering on the grounds that they ""deserve"" it."

If you aren't a populist, you're not a fascist no matter what else you are.
If you aren't a colonialist, you're not a fascist no matter what else you are.
If you aren't using fear of the Other to destabilize the social order, you're not a fascist no matter what else you do.
If you aren't anti leftist, you're not a fascist no matter what else you are.
Mussolini, Hitler & DeRivera qualify on ALL counts. ""Populist"" is the only one Franco arguably wasn't, but he started out a conservative general who picked the winning side & inherited DeRivera's movement.

Fascism is a knowable & identifiable political & social ethos.

Be liberal  if you want, but please learn what real fascism is before you try to tie it to one single idea like limiting dangerous rhetoric.

>but fuck off with that ableist shit.

as true as it is, ppl should calm the fuck down, it's not the N\*bomb and as I said in my upper comment, ppl need to educate themselves on that – and so many more – topic and are not quite there yet. It's ok to tell someone they're off, but attacking them outright is the wrong path my friend.

plus: like I said, I'm also no native speaker and didn't knew about the quirks and pitfalls in the English language and eng-leftist spaces in particular.

11720,h9542f,i clicked on something that put me on his email list for a while.  it was pretty entertaining (in an orwellian nightmare kind of way).
11721,h9542f,"[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Antifa](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Antifa) 

German-speaking right-wing extremists, right-wing populists and even some right-wing conservatives describe as anti-antifa a targeted, campaign-like fight against political opponents, which they associate with antifa or anti-fascism. Anti-antifa is about researching and publishing private data for the purpose of intimidation and threat. These activities are embedded in ideological advances that aim to achieve discourse sovereignty in public space for right-wing political goals.

In Germany, the first so-called anti-antifa campaign was initiated in 1992 by the neo-Nazi Christian Worch and his fellow campaigners. According to Anton Maegerle and Martin Dietzsch (Duisburg Institute for Language and Social Research - DISS), anti-antifa actions include not only concrete acts of violence by neo-Nazis but also journalistic and scientific activities of intellectual right-wingers."
11722,h9542f,"No, that was Antifa's board of directors you're thinking about. They were decimated when Antifa members working in the secret basement below their corporate office, killed dozens in a radioactive... Incident.

 You see, they were experimenting with the  nuclear subcriticality observed when the Clinton emails were placed atop Obamas birth certificate. But it was too much of a good thing: Some plucky fucker dumped all the Clinton emails - every single word about Benghazi she ever wrote - atop Obama's birth certificate, and when they came in.contact with each other, well... It was too late. The nuclear reaction went critical. Even several layers of Marxist texts weren't enough to shield them from the raw power of that blast, and it penetrated every inch of the Antifa headquarters. Most everyone there died. Though luckily, the Antifa CEO was away, out of the building. It's said he was out on the streets, rallying up his thugs to loot the establishments of some very fine people on the other side."

11738,h9542f,"Violence is not our sole method of antifascism, it’s simply the only one that gets attention drawn to it. Take the recent protests, for example. Antifascists were there, and there was violence, but as of yet no evidence has shown that antifascists were responsible for that violence. On the contrary, there is evidence that shows white supremacists showed up to do violence and cause problems. That, of course, isn’t to say antifascists are completely non-violent. However, it’s not the primary means of confronting opinions we are opposed to. We have impassioned conversations and debates with friends, family, and strangers. We engage in non-violent demonstrations and forms of protest. We do a lot of things. But when a white supremacist group shows up to a town, we find discussions less effective. Nazis and their ilk get punched.  
So, going back to your original question, if you’re opposed to punching white supremacists when they march down a street calling genocide, yeah, you’re probably a fascist.

11818,hnkjdf,">a person who kills another because they believe they will not recieve negative consequences for their actions and because they can

It is highly questionable, that they really just killed him because they were able to and believed they would get away with it. From the little information I have it rather seems to be accidental and negligent due to too aggressive behaviour from the officers. They still should get time in jail for that and be banned from the police force, but it's qualitatively highly different to killing a person just because one was able to and thought one would get away with it.

>In our society, as determined and codified by the DSM, a person who kills another because they believe they will not recieve negative consequences for their actions and because they can is a sociopath.

That is not the case at all. Diagnosing someone with a personality disorder isn't that easy or simple.

Firstly, there is no definition for sociopathy anyways. What would've been considered ""sociopathy"" a few years ago now counts as ""antisocial personailty disorder"" in the DSM, together with psychopathy, for instance. The umbrella of APD is wider than both sociopathy or psychopathy individually were.

The definition of a personality disorder in general, according to the DSM, already has to fulfill the following conditions:

* The pattern is inflexible and profound in a wide array of personal and social situations
* The pattern is stable and long-lasting, meaning it can be traced back to adolescence or early adulthood

There are also other conditions like it not being the result of drugs, physical or mental illness, but I guess those can be excluded here.

To diagnose someone with APD atleast three of the following criteria have to be fulfilled in a constant and profound pattern of the violation of others peoples rights **since the age of 15**:

* Failure to behave in a lawful manner and to adhere to social norms, which results in repeated actions that can lead to arrest.
* Pathological lying, usage of cover names or deception (fraud) of other people to gain personal advantages or pleasure
* Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead
* Irritability and aggressiveness, which expresses itself in repeated brawls or assaults
* Reckless disregard of ones own safety or the safety of others
* Constant irresponsibility which displays itself in the inability to hold a permanent job or to fulfill ones financial responsibilities
* Complete lack of remorse, which displays itself either by indifference or rationalization, when the person hurt, abused or stole from other people

The person also needs to be atleast 18 years old, an impairment of the social behaviour must've been already visible **prior to the age of 15**, and the antisocial behaviour doesn't occur explicitly during a schizophrenic or bipolar phase.

Furthermore what was originally classified as sociopathic has the traits of:

* being highly irritable and nervous
* being erratic and planless
* feeling easily offended
* reacting in reckless and uncontrolled manners
* having a tendency towards emotional outbursts like tantrums
* rarely being occupied for a long time with anything

In order to make a diagnosis, the psychologist/psychiatrist also has to make sure, that the respective patterns aren't better explained by the developmental stage of the person or **the social environment**.

Overall I would say that if you really diagnose them as sociopathic or just with APD in general across the internet and with that little information that we have, then you are just showcasing a lack of understanding of how severe personality disorders actually are and also how complex the human psyche is and how ""normal"" killing another person can be for various reasons. (Of course killing another person isn't really something normal in our modern western societies, but it certainly doesn't imply a personality disorder.) As I mentioned before, selective empathy is a thing and one can disregard another persons life for various reasons, even while being ""normal"".

If you want I can also go over the ICD criteria to find out whether or not they might have a ""dissocial personality disorder"", which is the ICD equivalent to APS of the DSM."
11819,hnkjdf,"They're still not sociopathic, and due to the rather different defintions of this term it doesn't even really get used anymore in professional settings. Selective empathy, based on circumstances and affiliation, is quite normal and calling everyone who is selective with their empathy sociopathic is just stupid. The fact that you even try to just label the shitty cop in this story as sociopathic is evidence for the fact that you are very selective with your empathy aswell. You try to label him as something different, not normal, not worth empathizing with, probably without even knowing enough information of the circumstances and especially about the person itself.

This armchair psychoanalysis, especially with barely any information, is just idiotic and doing more harm than good."
11820,hnkjdf,"I mean, it's the liberal apology machine that would say, ""This was a cop, doing normal cop things.  So even though it was violent and someone died, we'll give him a pass when anyone else causing this man to choke to death would be considered guilty of intentional murder because they committed intentional violence which could have killed someone and it did."""
11821,hnkjdf,It's *always* unethical.  The institution of policing itself is oppressive and needs to be abolished.
11822,hnkjdf,"Maybe, even though I can't really believe that either. Do you have any decent reasoning behind that statement?

Which is why we must remain vigilant for the social conditions that preceded the Holocaust, and because the consequences have the potential to be so great, we must proceed under the assumption that such social conditions will manifest a similar event.

*The path of least resistance means different things to different people, and is a matter of perspective. For example, one person might evaluate sitting on the couch watching TV to be the path of least resistance, because it requires minimal effort and suffering at present, while somebody else might feel that intense study is the path of least resistance, having set their sights more long-term, because the money from a professional career will make their life much easier as they age."

11835,hnkjdf,"I think he's a leftist who managed to make a mockery out of breadtube in all ways possible and anyone who misconstrues him as a fascist is an utter idiot.

If you look at his videos it's very plain that he's a leftist because the politically left ideas are what he leads with - he uses their own perspectives to mock the right.

However, I will say this - not clarifying that he's a leftist is a risky play and one which I'm not sure all of his viewers understand. I'm sure there's a few unironic centrists and fascists in his fanbase and that isn't good."
11836,hnkjdf,Unfunny as SHIT
11837,hnkjdf,"> Normal is following the path of least resistance*, and when that path requires depraved actions, it's normal to take those actions.

This is moral relativism of a weird sort. It's using an absolute context for something that is always conditional. 

By your logic, there is no such thing as depravity because it's always considered normal at the time. By your logic, witch-burning and cat-burning and all the other depraved actions from past generations are still in the category of normal behavior, as if society never evolves. 

That's essentialism, which is characterized by an ignorance of cause and effect. 

That thing you think is always static is actually always changing."
11838,hnkjdf,"Oh I didn't read any of that, acab"
11839,hnkjdf,I'm not discussing morality. I'm discussing the realities of human psychology.
11840,hnkjdf,Thanks for confirming my assumption about you.
11841,hnkjdf,"How is there no moral context to human behavior?

There's always a moral context to human behavior. Behavior is a consequence of psychology. 

You are discussing the difference between depraved behavior and normal behavior, but don't think there's a moral context in that scope. 

alrighty then. 

yeah....moral relativism."
11842,hnkjdf,Thanks for confirming you're a lil baby bitch

11848,gwegmc,Don’t take your ID or phone with you to protests. Only Carry some cash.
11849,gwegmc,"I hope they didn't ID the guy yet, because otherwise he will just get extra fucked now."
11850,gwegmc,"Damn, that was really dangerous, but definitely worth it."

11852,gwegmc,Fantastico!

11865,gwegmc,Fuck the police lol. They are angry scumbags

Edit: disregard 1:20 and on."
11884,gwegmc,Now they can arrest him for stealing the handcuffs
11885,gwegmc,Haha tue though
11886,gwegmc,"""Imma do some damage to your car anyways but maybe you will get mad and stop so I can try get a second chance at arresting you"" thoughts of that failing officer and its absolute gold. Dude ducked in like a swedish fish hitting the ground but ride out my dude!"
11887,gwegmc,Lol I immediately thought of the bunny cop chasing the guy from Zootopia.
11888,gwegmc,What a fuckin boss
11889,gwegmc,I dream about being this badass. Maybe one day... *longful sigh*
11890,gwegmc,"""But I'm SUPPOSED TO WIN!!!!"""
11891,gwegmc,The futile slap of a baton on the trunk
11892,gwegmc,I cum so hard when cops fail.

11894,gwegmc,"A lot of cops are unfit, also they're not in good physical condition either."
11895,gwegmc,"I guess he was never told ""r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut for you today!"""
11896,gwegmc,"Their arms were handcuffed, not their legs?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
11897,gwegmc,"I mean in Fast Five they basically destroyed like a an entire precinct and showed cops as corrupt. But that was anti South American, not anti cop. I wanna see Fast Five but like, remade in Minneapolis now."

11899,gwegmc,"I'm mostly a distance guy, but I'm learning the hurdles"
11900,gwegmc,"Burner phones are great, you still need to be able to contact people in an emergency and there are a lot of emergencies out there."
11901,gwegmc,"Actually you DO want to bring ID, because if the cops can't identify you, then they can detain you for longer, even if there's no charge. Really, ID alone is the bare minimum."
11902,gwegmc,"So weird that it's illegal to escape from illegal imprisonment in the US.

In Germany you are perfectly fine escaping from jail. You can't be punished for that.

If you were to damage the prison door etc, they'd get your for that, but the act of escaping is not illegal.


Probably safer to not bring ID to these kinda protests if you expect a mate to 'bail' you out though.

Plus fake plates as well."
11903,gwegmc,Ya im worried becuz it looks like the license plate is on camera
11904,gwegmc,Way safer than being in custody.
11905,gwegmc,"Also, check out /r/PraxisGuides"
11906,gwegmc,Police usually use zip ties when they're out for protests.

11913,gwegmc,And then it just bounces on to the ground.
11914,gwegmc,This was an exceptional comment.
11915,gwegmc,10/10
11916,gwegmc,Dope. Just be conscious of your form and drive with the knee.
11917,gwegmc,"Make sure people who care about you know where you're going, and that you might be out of touch for a while.  Phones will often not work in crowded protests, and a lot of emergencies will compound this situation.  And again, you will not be able to use that phone in the likeliest emergency of being disappeared by the police.

Bring a list of emergency contact numbers instead.  Once you are in a position where you have access to a phone (most likely a payphone, or someone else's cell), you will be able to call who you need to call."
11918,gwegmc,"There's a lot of caveats if you're going to do that. You need to buy it and any minutes with cash and take the battery out when you're not at a protest, for example. If it's only for calling 911 don't even bother buying minutes and don't do anything except call 911 with it."
11919,gwegmc,Second this.
11920,gwegmc,I mean it makes sense that Germany would make it legal to escape imprisonment.
11921,gwegmc,"Well you won't get fined for escaping, but they'll definitely fuck you."
11922,gwegmc,"The car was stolen by some rioters though. I don't know who took it, officer."
11923,gwegmc,"Definitely, even though I read the title I was still scared he would be shot halfway, glad he made it."

11927,gwegmc,Thanks man
11928,gwegmc,"There aren't payphones in a lot of places anymore. That's why I suggest the burner phone.

And for your contacts to have them so cops dont try and find you."
11929,gwegmc,I heard it's better to write the number of the ACLU or a lawyer on your arm (or other body part) so you can call if you get arrested.
11930,gwegmc,And by that same train of thought makes sense why the United States of America would make escaping imprisonment illegal.
11931,gwegmc,Nice lol that’s thinking ahead
11932,gwegmc,"Even if it is metal cuffs they're trivial to pick, and they all use the same key so a paperclip or having a key works."
11933,gwegmc,Shit u right. Maybe a typo then?
11934,gwegmc,"Two of the places where there ARE payphones are jails and hospitals.  Which, once again, are the places you will be in the most likely emergency you will find yourself."
11935,gwegmc,"ok, didnt know that"
11936,gwegmc,"They all use the same key?! Is this something one could 3D print, perhaps?"
11937,gwegmc,Nah. I got them both in fck12 and kept it short. All 1 bastards 2 are 1 cops 3 ;-)
11938,gwegmc,"Yeah, probably. Its just a hollow tube with a single, short flange off of it."

11989,j7jhey,"hey there im from greece.Mass media call for the largest antifascist protest in modern day greece.We were gathered outside the court room which was ""protected"" by 2500 protest police officer s and 2 vehicles that throw water at really high pressure.When the final decision about the court case was announced(that Golden Dawn is a criminal organisation and that 7 of them were charged with running a criminal organisation)people started celebrating.The celebration lasted only 40 seconds as the police began their vicious and without any reason attack to the peaceful protesters in order to dispurse them.This is how capitalism celebrates.They created these fascists monsters years ago,they let them become so popular during the hard austerity years in greece and they now claim to be the ones that put the monsters in jail.The antifascist struggle is also an anticapitalist one.Capitalism thrives in fascist dystopias and under capitalism and its inhumane living conditions fascism is born.FASCISM IS SMASHED ON THE STREETS.DONT LET THE GOVERMENTS FOOL YOU.THEY DO NOT WANT TO ABOLISH FASCISM..THEY USE FASCISTS AND HAVE USED IN THE PAST.THE STRUGGLE FOR AN ANTIFASCIST SOCIETY IS WON IN THE STREETS.NEVER AND NOWHERE SMASH FASCISM IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD"

12001,j7jhey,"Militias in Michigan? Hadn’t heard of that. I’ve heard of the armed terrorist groups out there but since the only two people who can legally call a militia are the Governor and the President and that shit hasn’t happened (though I wouldn’t put it past Donnie to do it) there’s no fucking militia in Michigan. Any other skin tone and they’d be a getting called a gang at best or a terrorist organization at worst. Since these fucks check every box for a failed terrorist plot, go ahead and call them what they are, not what they fucking cosplay as."
12002,j7jhey,"But those were very good people, they were just angry"
12003,j7jhey,Call them what they are please
12004,j7jhey,"I'm always kinda torn down the middle when I read stories like that. On the one hand, if those men were white supremacists, then good, I'm glad somebody stopped them. 

But then on the other hand, I too dream of one day storming the front steps of my opressors. And it disheartens me to see grassroots uprisings so easily squashed under the boot of tyranny. 

I support their anarchy, not their fascism."

I not sure how people don’t see this. A vote for a third party candidate is a vote for trump. If that is who you want as president then that is your choice but if you don’t want trump in office for another 4 years then you better fucking vote for Biden. This is not rocket science folks. 

Even someone like myself who considers themself a Democratic socialist will vote for Biden and Harris because they are closer to my political ideology then trump and his ilk ever will be by miles."

12102,i9bjbg,"He had a decent lead early on when there were several moderate Dems in the race. Then before Super Tuesday they had all dropped out and all the supporters went to Biden. Warren also threw him under the bus and didn't drop out early enough for Bernie to keep it close. After that the establishment just had to throw money and some weight around to crush Bernie. They were gas lighting us the whole time too saying Biden was now more progressive as a result. Then we got what exactly? DNC votes against M4A and legalizing marijuana, before they chose a fucking cop as VP during a historic movement to defund the police. It was all bullshit, now they're trying to appeal to the centrists (read: mostly white liberals) that would not vote for them if they legitimately planned to defund the police."
12103,i9bjbg,Not exactly. A third party vote is exactly like not voting for either Trump or Biden. It's also close to voting for both of them.

12140,dc0gfk,"I’ll bite. Honestly breakout incidents like these of violent antifa behavior don’t really prove anything. For starters, it’s difficult to see any of it as reflections of the whole because you’re not making the connection that antifa is not an organization. 

As such, there’s no such thing as antifa “members”, antifa is just being anti-fascist, its a fragment of ideology. Because of that, you have people “in” antifa who are anarchists, or demsocs, or leninist accelerationists or marxists: left-wing people with all sorts of other contrasting beliefs. You can’t rope them together based off of a few incidents in good faith, and its in especially bad faith to do that if you won’t also hold right wing breakout terror to run of the mill conservatives. 

Not to mention, there’s been no mass shooting, no massacre, or even, correct me if i’m wrong, a murder that was explicitly politically motivated by anti-fascism in recent incarnations of antifa. The closest thing I can think of is maybe the Dayton shooter due to the shooter’s online presence? But a plethora of sources have stated that it is not possible to say that the shooting was politically motivated, much less due to antifa ideology. 

When it comes to all these incidents of ‘hey they’re standing in that old lady’s way!’, ‘hey! that guy got hit with a bike lock!’, ‘hey that guy got hit with a crowbar!’, ‘hey they beat up that guy because they thought he was a proud boy!’- we could argue about them all day. Like, I could tell you, and truthfully, that the demonstrators who blocked her path were later condemned by the organizers of the protest anyway. I could tell you, and truthfully, that the bike lock incident happened during a climax in the protests where two fronts had met and were flinging threats at each other, and that the victim was no bystander, and was shielding people who were threatening to beat up antifa protestors. I could tell you, and truthfully, that the man who was hit with a crowbar by an antifa protestor was also caught on tape menacing protestors with weapons. I could tell you, and truthfully, that local left wing organizers started fundraising to help the poor bystander who was mistaken for an alt-right counter-presence because they realized the mistake and do not condone the action of violence being inflicted on bystanders. But ultimately, these breakout incidents are exactly that- breakout incidents. Branding antifa as violent harassers based off of these, with knowledge that there is no upper management of antifa, and with knowledge that antifa is a diverse group that cannot be represented by the actions of a few sparse individuals, is pretty unfair and confirmation bias-y don’t you think? 

Though a lot of people have already replied saying similar things and you didn’t have anything to say to them despite your “how brave and honest of you people” thing. Regardless, feel free to have a think about all this info, you don’t have to feel honor-bound to reply if you can’t find it in yourself to."

It is a phrase used to recognize the emotive reasons people move right and to state that the facts from the left are a threat to these emotive reasons. 

For example, if someone moves further right because they lost their job and they are told it was because Mexicans can be paid to do their job for less money (obligatory reminder that immigrants do not lower wages, bosses do), then being told that a company disregarding your personal safety in the interest of profit is not helpful to you at all. Because your feelings tell you that you need to be angry at something and the right is giving you a target.

The nationalist element is core to fascism as it sees the nation as the key societal element and the strenghth of that nation is paramount to the exclusion of virtually all else. To further this fascism always paints ""its group"" as the hard done by victim and ties up an individuals self esteem into the greater glory and achievments of the group.

12232,iux3sq,"That is what it is on the surface, but that is less what the phrase is and more what the phrase cosplays as.

It is not a real argument, not even in intention. It is a mantra. ""Facts don't care about your feelings"" is not repeated because it is an easy, albeit poor way to at least feel like you are winning an argument, it is repeated because it needs to be reinforced or you might start thinking about it too much.

The right does not even believe that they have all the facts on their side. Many members of the right are Judeo-Christian, which requires you to act based on faith, not on fact. And this is not an inherent flaw or anything, I think faith is useful and I think embracing any and all facts is a dumb way to live your life. But what it does mean is that the right recognizes, at least on some level, that their ideologies are the same as everyone else's: they are a list of what facts (or what even counts as a fact) are important and how one should act with regard to these facts. 

One of the facts they deem important in their ideology is the emotive drive of their actions. A big emotion for the right is the concept of destiny and how one should feel about what their destiny is. This fatalist thought process is at the core of things like capitalism and bigotry. But facts (especially those from the left) are the enemy of prophecy. What we are dealing with right now and what has historically happened in situations such as these are all potentially at odds with the supernatural concept of ""you'll get to where you're divinely destined to be one way or another"". 

So when a transperson says that ""I've always felt like I'm not a ___"" and Daddy Shapiro hits them with the ""Well facts don't care about your feelings"", is he dismissing the person's identity because he disagrees with it? Sure. But what he is doing on a deeper level is confirming his own identity and solidifying the ""feeling"" that he has always had that about his own identity being the universally correct one. And if the transperson then comes out and brings up actual concrete evidence to defend their identity, well their facts do not care about his feelings and therefore, they need to be avoided."

12242,iux3sq,"I’m saying that people like the original commenter are quick to assume that anti-fascism is anti-white, as they conflate the two. Building off of what u/randomnonwhiteguy was saying. 

There certainly is such a thing as racism against white people; Jewish people, Italians, and the Irish come to mind. However, in nations built on white supremacy, racism against white people (except things like antisemitism) doesn’t carry nearly as much weight, nor is it as prevelant. Cases of prejudice towards a white person on the basis of their race are localized and usually end when the interaction does, rather than anti-POC prejudice, which has the backing of institutionalized racism, and follows that person wherever they go."
12243,iux3sq,"On the off-chance at the very least someone reading this is even remotely playing at approaching the question in good faith, yes. It is possible to be negatively racist to white people. I distinctly recall an incident a couple years back when a pair of women abducted a man who, if memory serves, was a stranger to them and streamed on facebook his torture. It was believed the action was racially motivated. Disclaimer, I could absolutely be hazy on the details.

But when the suggestion that someone is being racist to a white person a vast majority of the time it is in the context of someone getting defensive after the kickback of saying ""All Lives Matter"". All lives should matter, that's the issue we need to fix. However most of the people who bank on that phrase can be filed as being in one of including but not limited to three camps; Those following in the footsteps of [Lee Atwater](https://youtu.be/X_8E3ENrKrQ?t=21), those who could be described by the saying ""When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression."", and those who are fortunate enough to just not be aware of the experiences that led to the formation of the current civil rights movement.

When you see someone saying it is not possible to be racist against white people there are a few ways to interpret that message as well. 1) When a person's trust is reliably shredded throughout their life and a pattern exists people will recognize it. When it comes to minority racism against whites the power dynamic is flipped. Factors like law enforcement patterns, the justice system, the housing market, and the wage gap ensure the minority racist just doesn't have the resources to act in the way a white racist does. Is the minority racist still racist? Yes. But failure to recognize the greys in how people can be hateful hurts efforts to fix the root problems of certain brands of hate. 2) Others use the sentiment that anti-white racism is nonexistent to highlight a mild exaggeration of comparison. Population density of people who exhibit racist behavior against minorities vs those against whites should invoke something to the tune of a cruiseliner against a cabin cruiser. And in a country like France that cruiseliner has to compare itself to a kayak. 3) As a blend of 1 and 2, many use it as a reverse-Atwater. Noting that the people who are generally racist against whites got there because our system is fucked and support that claim by looking for those patterns overseas.

So in short, is it possible? Yes. Does it happen? Yes. But when people bring it up are we respecting the distinctions or feeding into the propaganda that uses a problem it created to justify further nurturing that problem? Or can we expect this to be explained at length with a 20 minute deep-dive of a complicated issue on the fly and expect the person of an opposing viewpoint do anything more than tune out a minute in/interrupt at some point/etc.?  


Edit: Added ""that's the issue we need to fix"" for clarity."
12244,iux3sq,"That's because it can't.

There is no system in place today that exists to oppress white people for being white, and there never was (antisemitism and xenophobia absolutely exist, but are NOT based on skin colour).

White people who try to pull the reverse racism card are just desperate to claim oppression for their hurt fee-fees, and they do it almost exclusively while claiming that *actual* racism isn't a thing, or not as big a deal as people make it out to be.

Honestly, fuck anyone who insists that racism against white people is real.

Sincerely (not really), a white person."

12247,iux3sq,"I don't know too much about American culture(?lack of better word) but I know that all lives matter is a bullshit terrible disguised racist club, so fuck them. 

But to in any way say that racism can only be oriented towards people of colour is fucking bullshit, prejudice and downright offensive to any antiracist. There is no physical barrier that disables any prejudice based on the colour of skin. If youre prejudice based solely on colour of skin, you're a fucking racist. Its like saying men can't be raped, fuck those people. 

There is degrees and different kinds of racism, like systematic racism and that's more than likely a problem people of colour only experience, but to say that you can't be racist towards people who a pale skinned? 

At what colour of my skin cant I feel or experience racism? What if I'm tan? How tan? Is it genes? Fuck racist. No sympathy, no remorse."
12248,iux3sq,"Why would I or anyone else care you are white? Lol. 

You are correct in that most, if not all, western countries don't have a systemic racism towards people with a lighter pigment, but systematic racism isn't the only sort of racism there is. And just to add, people can be racist towards the colour of their own skin, racist aren't that clever. If anyone acts with fear or hate towards anyone based on the colour of their skin, what ever colour it might be, its racist. If you are prejudice towards people with a certain colour solely based on their skin, you are racist. 

You might not be it, hope not, but that dosent mean it does not exist. We are 7,5 billion people on earth and some of them dislike people who are white just because they are white. 

Racism is prejudicd towards people based on colour, whoever it might affect(effect?) its racism.

IYO how much pigment do you need to have before you can experience racism?"
12249,iux3sq,"Not trying to come off as a dick since you seem legitimate in your concerns, however you should look more into where the term caucasian comes from. Its not really accurate for most “caucasians.”"

That said I would maintain my stance on knowing the root causes.

But there are some who want to be proven wrong that their experiences are not a significant representation of whatever community hits their pattern.

Long lines are just one way that they attempt to suppress voting. They close polling stations, under man polling stations, purge voter rolls, etc. It's extremely disgusting, there have been 90 y/o's who have voted in every election be turned away from voting because they were purged.

All that said, racism affects POC about a billion times more than it does whites in this country. Any cries of racism from whites are often just examples of prejudice, as you've said. We should not allow them to detract from the much more real problems POC face. Good on you for calling that out!"
12339,fdnj3b,"Not true. Don't ever presume that white people cannot be the recipients of racism. My wife experienced being a white minority all through her adolescence and was on the receiving end of a lot of racism. It's about in-group and out-group, not skin color. This is a human problem that crosses all lines."
12340,fdnj3b,"Ah, of course, I forgot racism by definition excludes one race and has a geofence."
12341,fdnj3b,I don’t think it is too much to ask that everyone have a government issued ID. You can go to the DMV/BMV and get a non driving ID for like $5-$15.
12342,fdnj3b,"There are absentee ballots..

Soldiers, snowbirds, travelers... etc

This is more or less shite planning in densely populated (black and brown) communities.


It’s deincentivization of participation."
12343,fdnj3b,"Got ya.

All I can say is that things are different elsewhere. My experience is not yours, and yours isn't mine."
12344,fdnj3b,"I mean, the other side of that coin is that we're all born with rights and have to fight when they're taken away."
12345,fdnj3b,"The kind of gerrymandering the DNC does is bad, but nowhere near as bad as the voter suppression that the GOP has been doing. Illinois (where I live) is gerrymandered, but it is not to the point that one party receives 65% of the vote and gets 30% of seats."
12346,fdnj3b,"I don't see why those things shouldn't be open on Sunday. 

Kids work at those places as well. Saturday and Sunday is full time work day for school kids whether high school or college age. 

No one's working 7 days a week at one location( unless an employer is an idiot, the overtime pay, jeez), so they get their weekend whether it's a Saturday/Sunday or a Wednesday/Thursday weekend. 

It's really silly to think everything should close on Sunday."
12347,fdnj3b,Ah ok thanks for the info.
12348,fdnj3b,"Republicans not only require an Id, they also make getting an ID much harder. There have been several court cases they have lost over this issue. There was one state (Alabama, I think) where they closed all DMV locations in every majority-non-white counties except for 3 DMV’s that were open 3 days a month. It was fucking ludicrous.

There was another place where they required a Birth Certificate on file to get an ID, and in order to get a Birth Certificate ordered from out of state and put on file cost 100$. This clearly targeted poor people and immigrants to the state (not even foreign immigrants, immigrants from other states too) 

Contrast with Illinois, which has a voter ID law but where you simply have to present 2 forms of identification out of a list of dozens of acceptable forms of identification. 
Getting a duplicate is even easier."
12349,fdnj3b,"It is if you are a person who can't go get and ID for whatever reasons.  Plus the constitution says, you have the right to vote.  Here is a list of Amendments to the right to vote.

https://felonvoting.procon.org/questions/what-does-the-us-constitution-say-about-voting-and-punishment/

In none of these, does it says the user needs to provide x document to vote.  In my opinion, the argument is that if the State provides a requirement that all citizens can't do.  Is it legal?  The State just made it hard or impossible for you to vote by doing whatever activity they devised, does that infringe on your right to vote as specified in the Constitution?  

I've always thought that when it comes to voter IDs, the government should provide the means and fee to create one.  It isn't that hard to require everybody when they turn 18 and getting their licenses to also apply for their voter ID card.  Or make the State ID requirements qualified as their Voter ID card.  Also , they should have offices opened on weekends and provide transportation or reimburse transportation for people if they need it.  Some people work 3 jobs all hours all days.  How can these people go get an ID?  Some people aren't mobile to leave their house, how can they get their ID or register?  Some are citizens but are uneducated, how do we navigate that.  What is that saying, ""you don't know what you don't know.."" ??  Make the mailman qualify to take applications and verify people, etc.. I don't know.  The point is, we can make it easier, but those in power choose to make it harder.  You can guess why.

You can almost make the same argument for gun rights, depending on how you interpret the 2nd Amendment.  

Anyways, just my take on it.  I'm by no means a Constitutional lawyer."
12350,fdnj3b,Sure it’s the same message
12351,fdnj3b,"I'm not arguing for it, I'm stating the fact that that's why German elections are held on Sundays."
12352,fdnj3b,"Republicans are even rigging that. There was an election recently in (I think) North Carolina an election was canceled because the GOP candidate was found to have committed absentee-ballot fraud. Because the system is fucked, that same candidate was allowed to run in the replacement election _and he won._"
12353,fdnj3b,"I agree with you, I think just requiring everyone to get an ID once you turn 18 is the logical option. And yes they need to make it easier to do so. Then we wouldn’t be having this discussion"
12354,fdnj3b,Under the constitution it isn’t a right with a government we have no rights only privileges. Why we need to demolish the state
12355,fdnj3b,"I get that, but shifts are 8 hours for pretty much every major retailer. Morning shift gets out early and night shift has the day to vote.

12357,fdnj3b,"> 13% of people my age voted. I voted. They didn't.

I think you're misreading that statistic. That is [voters by age](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/bernie-sanders-needs-young-voters-on-super-tuesday-theyre-staying-home) not what percent of each age group voted.

Of those who voted, 13% were between the age of 19 and 29. I can't find an exact number of the demographic, but according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, [9% of the US population is between 19 and 25.](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-age/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedDistributions=adults-19-25&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) As long as there isn't some huge spike between 25 and 29, that seems like a pretty good turnout.

The statistics are also really skewed, since we know that the fertility rate is less than 2, so young voters are fewer than the other generations. Also because the other age groups have different sample sizes:

Age Group | Range
---------|-----
18-29 | 11 years
30-44 | 14 years
45-64 | 39 years
65+ | 49 years*

*I just googled the oldest living person in the US (114)

Also yes, long lines are an excuse. What if you have to work early the next day and end up at the polls at midnight? Like the last person to cast his ballot in Texas, [who left at 1:30am](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hervis-rogers-had-to-wait-seven-hours-to-cast-his-ballot). Sure, he managed to vote, but that doesn't mean everyone can stay up that late. What about bus drivers? Heavy machinery operators? People who need to be well rested to perform their job safely? They can't sit in a polling center for hours on end."
12358,fdnj3b,"Some states are actively reducing polling locations, usually in targetted areas too.  Also the people who are ""just as unwilling to work the booths as they are to vote"" are unable to work the booths for the exact same reasons they are unable to take time to vote.  There are many reasons, of course, but if you can't take time off your job to vote you can't vote, and that's a big one."

You could still march with an ""Enforce immigration laws"" or ""Black Lives Matter"" sign. European countries do this and retain broad rights to freely express political thought. And I wouldn't go as far as Europe has, where you can't say anything mean about a protected group at all. Just calls for violent action and/or removal/elimination.

Clara Zetkin a socialist feminist wrote in 1923. She Cautioned against demonizing the rank and file of fascist movements. She reminded us that only when the real and profound grievances of those attracted to fascism are addressed can they be pried from its grip. “The best of them are seeking an escape from deep anguish of the soul,” “They are longing for new and unshakable ideals and a world outlook that enables them to understand nature, society, and their own life; a world outlook that is not a sterile formula but operates creatively and constructively. Let us not forget that violent fascist gangs are not composed entirely of ruffians of war, mercenaries by choice, and venal lumpens who take pleasure in acts of terror. We also find among them the most energetic forces of these social layers, those most capable of development. We must go to them with conviction and understanding for their condition and their fiery longing, work among them, and show them a solution that does not lead backward but rather forward... https://www.truthdig.com/articles/how-we-fight-fascism/ "
12405,dj1s5l,"First point that is not an anarchist argument. That can be seen in liberal and conservative philosophy's. 
The State once again you are given them power to interpret that law however they see fit. You can try to narrow it and make it as clear as you want. The courts decide what they mean. 
Let's take American history for example. The bill of rights said the Government cannot prevent speech. Here comes the lesser talked about reality. It never said they can't punish you for it. And the Government sure as hell punished people for it. Eugene V Debbs was running for president he said in his speech that ""wars abroad are not your fight, they are imperialistic wars."" They arrested him, spent years in prison. During World 
War 1 the Boston symphony could not play Beethoven because it was German. Comedians could be arrested if they were vulgar like they did arrest Lenny Bruce. 

This is who you want to give that power to? There is no slippery point the laws we have right now they use to punish you for saying something they do not like. Snowden for example they trying to take his money from book sales. Chelsea Manning exposed the criminality of the State she is in prison. 

Let's say you ban swastikas. Now the Cops can just put some swastika sticker in some persons pocket now they arrested. Some kid in school makes something that looks similiar to a swastika now they arrested. 

And it's the wrong tactic. Because you are not solving the roots of the problem. If they would have banned Mein Keif, it would have done nothing.  What was the sources that Hitler was appealing to? Address that and Facism dies. 

If you want to ban speech. Hate speech is the least of the damage. Compare it to Free Market Ideology. Free market ideology hurts more than any hate speech we have seen. Go to Detroit, Flint Michigan,parts of Africa or Latin America. See what that ideology has done to people. Look at the crime, mortality rate, Job loss, etc. That causes people to get angry and hopeless. Makes them Vulnerable for fascism. The answer is not giving the Government the power to ban speech."

Technically due to my panic disorder, I could be declared mentally ill. Really didn’t even provide a hiccup when I bought my wife a firearm.

Is it merely you’ve been committed?

I gotta say, lots and lots of mentally ill people that shouldn’t own guns have never been committed."
12411,dj1s5l,"No it doesn't.  Background checks are a simple criminal history check in most states.  Even states that have so called ""mental health"" requirements base those decisions on legal criteria, not actual mental health criteria.  This is an important distinction 1) because we have a much longer history of treating people with mental health issues as second class citizens than we do treating people with mental health issues, 2) mental health diagnostics tend to be rather arbitrary and come from an era in psychology where the theories were based largely on the imaginations of the founders of the discipline rather than any facts, and 3) you can't legally deny a right to someone a right based on a status, it has to be based on a behavior.

Saying this because 1) mentally divergent or unhealthy people aren't and never should be second class citizens and 2) I don't want anyone to think that if they have a serious problem they should attempt to avoid any help just in case it would affect their ability to own a gun now or in the future.

So if you're a potentially bipolar dude who likes duck hunting and thinks they might benefit from some professional help but doesn't want that professional help to mean they can't go duck hunting and are afraid they're mutually exclusive, they aren't!  Go get your help, enjoy your hobbies.

12412,dj1s5l,"Banning based on mental illness might work if those enforcing it had the best interests of everyone at heart and always would till the end of time, but it would be pretty easy for a fascist to suddenly declare that anyone who believes in socialism is mentally ill. The problem with using mental illness as a method of determining whether or not someone should be allowed to have a gun is also that mental illness is still so poorly understood and subjective so really the only proof you can have of mental illness for most people is the word of a doctor and those around them. How hard would it be for a doctor to go ""oh man you're totally mentally ill you can't be allowed to have a gun"" and when you respond ""no I'm not"" they can just go ""that's exactly what a mentally ill person would say!""

While yes I think it's a bad idea to give a firearm to somebody who is in the middle of a psychotic break, has a history of remorseless violence, etc, I think it's impossible to create policy that prevents that without also hurting many many others who are doing just fine, as such a policy would have to be entirely on a case by case basis and this would be incredibly subject to abuse if the people enforcing it did not have good intentions.

Punishing people for protected speech is precisely what the First Amendment prohibits the government from doing. Sometimes they do it anyway. Again, the solution is what...no government?  We have remedies in our system when this happens and they occasionally even work. 

Leaks of classified information are so far afield as not to be relevant to this conversation. Certainly this was never countenanced by the founders as protected. I think they deserve whistleblower protections, but the 1A doesn't really help here, except for the publishers of the info.

Cops already put drugs on people. They'll always be able to find a way to frame you one way or another. The question of police abuse of power is a separate one.

The expression of bad and wrong ideas is functionally different from a threat to a group. The former provides the chance for the ideas to be challenged, the latter simply creates fear and discourages free participation in the commons, serving no other purpose.

First off, there's no guarantee that you won't be run by the vendor you're buying from, and most will because federal law requires that gun dealers (defined as anyone who sells more than 4 fire arms in a year) conduct back ground checks.  Plus most gun shows that I've seen run the checks before you even enter.  So even if you had a potential vendor who wasn't going to run background checks, because they're only selling 3 guns that day (which, what?), most of the time the gun show itself is running checks on everyone attending anyway.

And really think about this...  Who in their right mind is going to rent a table at the gun show (which costs the vendor serious money) to sell 3 guns?  They're going to be expensive guns.  They're either full auto or they're well documented historical collectors items and...  You don't want the general public to really access either of those if you're a vendor for either because you're risking damage and it's unlikely that your target audience is just...  There.  Plus if you're selling either, there's a lot more paperwork and bullshit for either of those kinds of purchases, with any automatic weapon there's a huge ATF rigamarole, with highly desirable antiques there's all sorts of insurance and documentation you're going to want to have.  

And even if, for some reason, there was some guy out there with 3 old Tommy guns who wanted to sell them at a gun show, and even if there was some criminal that was looking to score a gun for criminal proposes...  Do you have any idea how much money those things cost?  We're talking tens of thousands of dollars.  Fuck it, let him have it, because the amount of explosive material he could render with that money far exceeds the death to dollar ratio that the guns would achieve.

So basically, no, the gun show loophole isn't a real issue."

And I know that we all like to think that the nazis could never rise to power here, we could never have book burnings, we could never have political opponents being sent to concentration camps, but it can happen here, and the people in the Weimar Republic thought the same thing, the nazis were viewed as a fringe group that weren’t a real threat, that was a terrible mistake"

Key sentence SUPPRESSION WOULD BE UNWISE. And the book is about exploring intolerant ideas. It is classical liberalism like F. A. Hayek. He is not for hate speech laws. Being a classical liberal means he would agree with Liberals resolve issues with reason and argument rather than violence. 

Even if we took that paradox how some think it means it would be wrong. Because the message does not spread like the plague. It only spreads when the conditions are met for it. Which is Economic stagnation, Loss of Jobs, The middle class being betrayed. This one is very important. Fascism almost always comes out of the despair of the Middle Class.

The stat you gave on hate crimes in Germany is completely irrelevant because they are more willing to classify and prosecute crimes as ""hate crimes"" than the US, so no meaningful comparison can be made on the number of these sorts of crimes.

There's no claim here that prosecuting hate crimes is a magic solution to racism overall, but you haven't made any meaningful point either that German hate speech laws are flawed or that hate speech should be permitted.

That the US is spectacularly incapable of enforcing laws in any way other than a revoltingly racist and classist manner doesn't invalidate the rationale of those laws.

That's why it's so fucking hard to get criminal charges to stick to police or ICE... Because technically speaking they didn't violate the law and therefore they aren't criminals.  And for that matter, the majority of the awful things Trump has done have mostly been skirting the edge of legality.

The law needs to be changed.

The law needs to explicitly make illegal the things police, ICE, and Trump are doing.  And there needs to be legal path in place to insure that when the police or government agents or the president, does these illegal things, there is the ability to actually enforce the law.  And there needs to be legal punishments of police that try to subvert the criminal charges brought against police officers.

12523,i0m97f,"Yes, but the Nuremberg trials were exceptional, and things would have been a lot easier if it had already been illegal at the time, and if the law wasn't changed afterwards it would also have been dumb.

Also only 161 people were convicted at Nuremberg.  In reality it should have been probably tens of thousands, possibly upwards of a few hundred thousand.  Instead they just convicted the highest ranking leadership and let the average SS go.

Which is abominable.

Which is a problem when the rank and file police and ICE are the one committing the atrocities.  99% of all the rank and file people involved in the holocaust wound up walking free, specifically under the ""I was just following orders"" defense.  And they got out of it, successfully.

That's just basic historical fact.  Less than 1% of people involved in the execution of the holocaust faced any jail time.  And only around 0.1% received the death penalty.

The law permitting these atrocities is a bad thing.  People shouldn't be walking free in mass numbers after committing murder.

And I'm not saying that the police or the ICE or Trump shouldn't be thrown under prison and buried there.  They should 100%.  But it is a lot harder because what they are doing is legal under the law, so you have to convict them based on what should have been illegal, and that's a much harder bar to pass.

And, there's no reason to continue accumulating more people who commit atrocities that are legal and thus hard to convict, instead of changing the law to make it illegal so it's trivial to throw the book at them.

Like, the law itself is also a problem.  The law is absolutely grotesquely broken.  Police executing civilians, and ICE concentration camps and Trump should be as easy of a conviction to acquire as that of a serial killer.  Just a complete easy slam dunk.  And it isn't.  Under current law it's one of the single hardest things to convict a person of because it isn't illegal, it's ""just"" atrocities and violations of human rights which should have been illegal but aren't.

So it needs to be a pretty high priority to get the law changed so it is illegal.  Also convict the police and ICE and Trump while your at it.  But stop leaving an open door for anyone who wants to commit atrocities.  An open door that says ""there is a 99% chance you won't have consequences for your actions."""

STFU. One of the leading prosecutors in the Nuremberg trials was Roman A. Rudenko, a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and there was intense and systematic denazification in the Russian-occupied zone of Germany. The Russians did more in a matter of hours to land victories against fascism than blue-haired, maladjusted, effete weirdos in Berkeley, California have ever done in their whole entire lives.

>I wouldn't respect their judgement because they only tried people that weren't useful to the allies (particularly the US) for other projects

Uh, pretty sure the Allies would have made use of Guderian and von Manstein, who were skilled military strategists, but they didn't occupy any important role after the war and in many cases were repressed.

9 million NSDAP members and as 10 million Hitler Youth members in 1945 were not guilty of anything, and to put all of them on trial followed by repression would be borderline genocidal."

There are intactivists which will attack you for supporting circumcision in any way.

12666,czkxxa,Well that is the thing it is only a common practice in Eastern Europe among Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church stance on male Circumcision currently is neutral and historically they even denounced the practice. But my guess is that in Eastern Europe they are influenced by the Russian Orthodox Church where they also practices it.
12667,czkxxa,"Yes in Eastern Europe they do so it is not the whole of the Roman Catholic Church. I know this since I am of polish descent, my guess why it is like that is because they were influenced by the Russian Orthodox Church who also practices male Circumcision."

That's not true. I am Russian, here Orthodox people do not do circumcision. It's only a Muslim and Jewish thing (though IDK if many Russian Jews do this, as the majority of Russian Jews are either irreligious or non-practicing)"

12685,czkxxa,There are no significant proven medical benefits and it’s a procedure with a risk of serious damage done on people without their consent. If you don’t see what’s wrong with that then I don’t know how to help you. If someone wants to get circumcised of their own volition let them but that isn’t the kind of decision you make for a person that can’t even speak because of a belief they don’t even understand.
12686,czkxxa,There is absolutely no practical reason for circumcision
12687,czkxxa,"Everytime....
My fault. 
I think parents should choose, btw."
12688,czkxxa,"I have 30 years of experience with being circumsized and not one bad memory of it. You're telling me that I'm dead wrong and to just believe you without offering me any evidence. Sorry to say but I'm just gonna keep believing the same thing I believe, cause you're not giving me a single reason to change my mind other than, ""I say that it's wrong, and also that someone else said it once, but I can't tell you about that you have to find out about it yourself"
12689,czkxxa,"I'm pretty sure that the anesthesia doesn't last all the way through it healing though. Which is why I'm glad my parents had it done to me, also I'm sure it's quite expensive as an adult in America as well. That's my reasoning for being quite happy about my parent's decision. I wouldn't want to go through that as an adult, although I would like to be circumsized. Therefore, I'm happy I was circumsized as a baby, furthermore I chose to have it done to my son, as my experience in life has led me to be greatful that things occurred how they did, and I wanted to do that for my son. 

Although I know that not everyone is the same, and I would loathe myself if I did something that negatively impacted my son's life. But as he is slightly ahead of the developmental curve in all aspects mental physical and emotional, (in regards to recognizing emotions from others and himself), except height, (which I would assume is because my wife is a short lady), I still feel like I made the right decision. 

If you or any others have any good studies that could show me some studies, or non anecdotal evidence that shows some of the negative aspects of circumcision, I would be happy to read them with an open mind, and am happy to discuss things with you, (or anyone else), but discussion isnt telling each other that they're wrong, demeaning each other, or arguing in bad faith. I only say that because I know this is a hot button issue and I don't want to just be put down because of my views when in my experience they haven't impacted me or anyone I know negatively."

Do I like Biden?  Fuck no, the guy is an absolute festering hell pit.  Do I like Trump?  Fuck no, the guy is an absolute festering hell pit.

So what's the difference?  Pain response.  When you move to make Trump mad, he gets mad and does something stupid and passive aggressive.  So every time you kick him in the dick, you get the good feelings, but not positive results.  This was the same with Hillary, but with potentially much more dangerous results (like we'd probably be at war with Russia, that part was true, pretty much all of the Russian Government hates the Clintons).

But with Biden?  Kick him in the dick, and his response is to appease, and then leave.  And this is functional, but it's going to make us look really mean.  We're definitely not going to look nice doing it.  But getting the job done is job number one.  So the question is, and you're going to have to look deep in your soul on this, can you dick torture the shit out of an old man for four years to get what you want?  In full view of the public?  Are you willing to force him to watch as you metaphorically tie him up and again I must stress, metaphorically burn his childhood home to the ground and then kick him in the ribs repeatedly until he passes out?

12727,hrs3pj,"Not an American (I’m from Canada) so take this with a grain of salt, but in all seriousness, as I see it we’re kinda fucked either way. 

Trump may just be a symptom and not a cause and Trump may not be bright enough to be assigned a coherent ideology, but the guy is surrounded by literal neo-Nazis and seems to have no problem with that and they’re signalling and dig whistling to the Nazis in the audience (those 88 ads, the inverted red triangle, 14 words in the first sentence, the $88 baseball on their site, the America First T-shirts with “not-quite-a-Nazi-eagle” on them)... the kind of guy to declare antifa a terrorist org? That’s dangerous.

But on the other hand, Biden won’t change anything. In fact Biden getting elected will make tons of liberals suddenly think ‘everything is fixed now- time to go to brunch and stop thinking about politics’. I mean just look how Obama getting elected kinda killed the Occupy movement. It makes it harder for us to point at problems, and means that the dems don’t think they have to work for the vote by us in no progressive candidates. The other problem is that even if Biden wins, Trump will still find a way to have substantial media influence, and his base will still listen to him, and that’s still puts us in a bad place.

If I were American I’d probably vote green (who are officially democratic eco-socialists) to help send a message and get them to their 5% so they can get some funding... but that said strategically maybe that’s not great in swing states.

Eeewwww. Strategic voting... and liberal representative democracy...... revolution (in minecraft) when?"
12728,hrs3pj,"Yeah, pretty much what I've been preaching. Sure, vote for Biden as harm reduction, but then immediately spend your time and energy on revolutionary and antifascist organizing, because if Biden gets elected, he will deteriorate very publicly and the Republicans get a free pick next time, and they have proven that they are ready to treat fascists as their base."

I don't really understand the reasoning here.

I can easily see in four years biden will get voted out. He's just another Hillary. Nobody likes him, and if the rumors are true and someone like a tucker carlson comes and runs against biden?

Obama basically got away with everything because he wasn't as bad as who came before or after, despite doing things like expanding the security state, going after journalists and whistle blowers, all of the immigration problems, the drone wars, etc.

The problem is that during Obama people didn't pay attention to politics, and they want to go back to that time with Biden. It's depressing, but there's a significant chance for another 2010-like sweep and pendelum swing after a Biden victory of that were to open. It's good to not forget to keep fighting.

So in 2008 we were coming off of the disaster of the Bush years. 2 pointless wars, hundreds of thousands dead, economic crash (I know, it sounds very familiar), and America's response was...a competent, slightly-less-conservative-than-the-last-guy democrat.

Look at what happened with the historical fascist countries. Germany is well regarded for its competence, but it isn't exactly a left wing dream.

Italy had a relatively strong communist party for a while, but now has pseudo-fascists back.

Spain was maybe more left wing than a lot of Southern Europe for like a decade or two, and now is just a middle of the road neoliberal nation.

So accellerationism gets you a very competent status quo at *best.* I don't think we can rely on people 'just getting fed up' so much that they all collectively ignore their worst impulses and sign up to build a better world."

Fascism does also feed from a perverted form of class consciousness, and can emotionally hijack this discourse. 

Plus, it's incredibly infuriating to see people who make this sort of argument forget the human costs of fascism. I refuse to accept that genocide would ever be an acceptable price for achieving communism.

12849,hrs3pj,"Call it accelerationism if it helps, but in my eyes it's simply acknowledging the reality that until things get significantly worse for the people who still aren't really affected yet, they will continue to resist change, and progress will never be made.

I understand that what happens after a revolution might not be the ideal or the end goal, if anything it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to build a perfect society directly out of the ashes of capitalism, colonialism, and so on, but that doesn't mean we don't still hope and fight for a revolution, does it?

If we continue with the Hunger Games theme - Katniss killing Coin is my favourite part of the trilogy because it serves as a reminder that someone overthrowing one corrupt leader and/or system, doesn't make that person automatically better, nor safe from being overthrown themselves.

&#x200B;

Edit: really not sure why all the downvotes - the more I look in to it (because I'd honestly never heard the term before), the less my original statement seems to have anything to do with accelerationism (pointing out reality ≠ believing that that reality is good as an ideology, nor is it the same as contributing to it), and I'm really not sure how saying that we keep fighting *despite* the fact that society at large isn't ready yet (or might never be) is a bad thing.."

12867,hrs3pj,">There's nothing saying the Republicans won't field a competent fascist in 2024 even if Trump gets in again this year, though.

But the Democrats losing the election might convince them that if they want to win again, they'll have to go for the progressive candidate next time. Not the Democratic leadership, of course (they don't care who wins, as long as it's not a progressive who might threaten their wealth and power), but the actual Democratic voters.

The idea isn't to stop the Republicans from running a fascist in 2024, the idea is to convince the Democrats that if they don't start embracing actual progressivism, they'll lose to the fascist the Republicans run in 2024.

That said, I've reluctantly decided to vote for Biden anyway. I'm *just barely* convinced that the real threat of upcoming Supreme Court seats and the immediate issues are more important than a *potential* competent 2024 Republican. I don't like it at all, but there it is.

Of course, on anything but the presidency, my vote goes to progressives or nobody. If we can't scare the Democratic leadership by threatening their grasp on the presidency, we can at least go after their actual seats, and *that* threat to their power might be enough to convince them to join us on the left."

https://i.imgur.com/DVnRJuy_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium"
12876,hrs3pj,He's revealing to neoliberals the reality of their country. Because all this shit happened to minorities already
12877,hrs3pj,I don't think it's inaccurate to say Biden is a right winger.
12878,hrs3pj,"Might be slower for the next 4 years, but given the strong backlash effect in this country, it can result in an even faster pace with the next Republican president. Electing Democratic centrists has only led to this in the last three decades."
12879,hrs3pj,and a biden presidency achieves this in your opinion?
12880,hrs3pj,maybe
12881,hrs3pj,"No one is talking about letting turmp win. Is just that you guys seem to think Biden will stop fascism, rather than freeze it temporarily."
12882,hrs3pj,"USA lost it's hope of change for now when the DNC knifed Bernie, again. The DNC would rather Trump than Bernie."
12883,hrs3pj,"No. But pretending like the poster did, and rewriting history, that like Obama really wanted to do good social democratic policies but just couldn’t is fucking horse shit.

It is revisionism of the worst kind to pretend like the DNC is an ally to any kind of leftist/socdem (let alone demsoc) agenda. They are actively enemies to it. They are co-conspirators with the right but with less overt racism and nationalism (only a bit).

If we want to have any chance of fixing anything, we have to know our enemies. If Joe Biden, Obama and Pelosi are not your enemies politically then you are not a leftist and I would say your not a serious antifascist."
12884,hrs3pj,[deleted]
12885,hrs3pj,The fuck adjective would you use for contributing to the re-election of a fascist?
12886,hrs3pj,I meant the timeline is changed by yourself. It isn't a static destiny. You shape it with your actions and decisions.
12887,hrs3pj,"OP is concerned that many Americans oppose trump because he's a reality tv show host with the mental and emotional maturity of a child, and don't actually care as much about his policies.

As such, they're worried that people will relax after a Biden victory sets things ""back to normal"", and potentially not bother to vote in 2024 even if the opposing candidate has worse policies than Trump."
12888,hrs3pj,What do you expect from a biden presidency?
12889,hrs3pj,And? My point still stands.
12890,hrs3pj,I’m shocked that accelerationists even browse this sub.
12891,hrs3pj,"Accelerationism, even by its *most* charitable interpretation, is just ""fuck you, I got mine"" for leftists."
12892,hrs3pj,"But when a candidate calls anti-facists terrorists, you pay attention and vote that fucker out of office.
Sometimes you work with whatever methods are available. Both candidates are not the same."
12893,hrs3pj,"Funny... I don’t remember Biden shooting tear gas at his own citizens for a photo shoot with a bible he doesn’t believe in. Nor do I remember Biden repeatedly suggest that journalists are the enemy of the people. Also don’t remember Biden supporting white nationalists. Don’t remember Biden going against science and lying to America that COVID19 was a hoax in an effort to retain his power. And really don’t remember Biden asking Russia for election help to destroy our democratic process. Trump also hired people to lead the EPA, Education, Energy, Labor etc regulatory institutions and destroy them to make them powerless so profits can be made instead of care for citizens. Then there’s Trump encouraging violence at his rallies, even offering to pay legal fees for punching protesters that don’t agree with his hate rhetoric. Getting the crowds to boo and yell at news outlets covering the rally that Trump didn’t like. Trump constantly uses fear that the “liberals” are coming to destroy America and only “he” can save them. Then Trump supporting police brutality and ignored the citizens cry for reform with BLM. Most of all, don’t remember Biden say anti-facists are terrorists like Trump did. Wow, guess it looks like YOU are completely wrong in that statement."
12894,hrs3pj,"Biden is terrible but his platform is slightly softer.

Rather have a fascist that doesn't roll back trans rights than one that does."
12895,hrs3pj,"Biden is bad, but the two really don’t compare. Also, electing a president doesn’t just mean electing the president as a person, but also their cabinet and potential Supreme Court justices, among other things.  Joe Biden isn’t likely to appoint literal Nazis and science deniers in his cabinet like trump has. If you really can’t see the difference between the two the I implore you to gain some perspective.

Again, I really do not like Biden but he is nowhere near as bad as Trump, who is arguably personally responsible for the covid pandemic, as he dissolved Obama’s pandemic task force and is arguably directly responsible for 100,000+ deaths. The same can’t be said for Biden, and even Clinton, who I don’t like any more than Biden, wouldn’t have dissolved it and more people would be alive today"
12896,hrs3pj,"If you aren't intelligent enough to understand that the consequence of presidency where Trump doesn't even have to worry about getting re-elected and can just fuck everything up even more are vastly more damaging than the one of an incompetent democrat, yes you aren't a leftist. Leftism doesn't work with a personality cult like you Bernie buster do.

Biden sucks and I don't think anyone here said the opposite. Don't straw man because you're mad to be wrong. But it isn't 1 or 0. Trump sucks more."
12897,hrs3pj,Electoralism is not going to save you in the end. Start getting ready for the worst outcome NOW. I dont want to hear about how everyone went back to business as usual and then get shocked to find out that there is an actual smart Fascist in the White House in a few years.
12898,hrs3pj,"Biden+strong 3rd parties.

If they get 5% of presidential vote, they get federal funding to be able to compete on 2024. Lesser evite needs to end."
12899,hrs3pj,"The thing is if Biden gets elected he'll accomplish nothing because a) he doesn't want to and b) even if he wanted to he can't inspire enough people to do anything for him so he won't retake the Senate so anything he tries will get blocked.

After 4 more years of Trump it might still be possible to do anything about runoff climate change but after 4 to 8 years of Biden and 4 to 8 years of another Republican who's exactly like Trump in every way that matters it'll be too late to do anything."
12900,hrs3pj,cring
12901,hrs3pj,Politics is not a reality TV show. Americans are too peabrained to have free will.
12902,hrs3pj,"I mean, left accelerationism is a thing"
12903,hrs3pj,"Accelerationism is not what you think it is, it does not mean increasing oppression in an effort to ignite revolutionary potential. Nobody thinks that way and it's not real. Accelerationism is an incredibly complex philosophy and TBH I don't even know of anyone that understands it completely but it's certainly not some dumb ""haha support fascists"" idea."
12904,hrs3pj,Look at all the leftist groups and subreddits that have grown. He is confirmed correct.
12905,hrs3pj,"I wish people would remember that you CAN apply ""common sense"" even to big concepts, like this. Doesn't mean you have to rely on it totally, that's stupid. But use the tool of a common sense like one of your gadgets on your utility built, and try reading the situation with that before trying other tools, like statistics and history. But in this case common sense says but how about don't vote Trump in order to gamble on widespread misery and uncertainty for the chance that maybe a good despot will fill the power vacuum. Just maybe don't. Ok next gadget."
12906,hrs3pj,In an alternate timeline where Hillary won the same shit would probably happen
12907,hrs3pj,Iirc he’s disavowed that
12908,hrs3pj,We had a similar thing over here back in 2016 with 'Lexit'. Apparently trashing the economy is a good thing because we'll definitely be in a fit state to do socialism afterwards.
12909,hrs3pj,They don't think the existing ground to which it has burned is groundy enough?
12910,hrs3pj,Wait it’s not???
12911,hrs3pj,"Yeah, you're kind of proving my point. Here in America democrats are considered left and I can promise you, you aren't getting anything further left into a position like President at least not in the near-term. So when people make comments like the one you just made, you are drawing a wedge between left-purists(socialists) and left-wannabes (dems/libs). Idk where social-dems are for you but I would put them somewhere in the middle of the two. 

Do you think your mentality overall is helping or hurting the country? Do you think you are helping us eradicate the right or does it not matter to you because ""both parties are the same""?"
12912,hrs3pj,"That's the sad truth of it; as shitty and complicit as they are, they're still our first port of call to slow the spread of fascism. Fuck FPTP and its forced dichotomies."
12913,hrs3pj,[deleted]
12914,hrs3pj,none? Obama had a very effective treaty with Iran that Trump shredded.
12915,hrs3pj,">this isn’t about covid

So what you’re saying is that you’re choosing to ignore covid as a variable? 

I don’t by any means disagree with what you’re saying, but ignoring it wholesale seems rather irresponsible, no?"
12916,hrs3pj,The fascists won in 2016. Vote them out in 2020.
12917,hrs3pj,Apparently brainworms. Hope you can find a cure.
12918,hrs3pj,"You could have at least read his policies, it's kind of cringe when you talk about something you didn't do your research."
12919,hrs3pj,But he’s not a fascist.
12920,hrs3pj,Yes because he’s not a fascist and trump is. Like what? It’s not like having another trump presidency will be a piece of cake one and done. That man has claimed countless lives and has ruined the lives of thousands because of his far right nationalism and you’d take that over a neo-lib just cause Bernie lost?
12921,hrs3pj,"I never claimed the DNC is leftist or a leftist ally. They are not fascist though. They aren’t left but they also aren’t fascist (neoliberal imperialism != fascism).

Antifascists are not explicitly leftist (though most are). It’s supposed to be a union of anyone who is against fascism, and that includes liberals if they wanna help. I personally consider myself a socialist, but I don’t think there is any harm in voting for a neoliberal to stop a fascist. 

As I said Trump has threatened to invade Seattle, he also wants antifa to be declared a terrorist organization. This should terrify you. If he gets four more years, both antifascist and socialist movements will likely be heavily suppressed. We can’t organize/educate/pressure for socialism if the military is in our streets. Biden sucks but at least we can continue to work under him."
12922,hrs3pj,Existentialism is Better
12923,hrs3pj,"American? It’s not like biden isn’t a fascist, too. It’s not like Obama didn’t have the exact same pro-police, pro-imperialism, pro-terrorism-rhetoric, pro-surveillance, pro-corporate, pro-military roots of fascist governance.

I mean vote for biden in some harm reduction context, but there is no way to vote against fascism."
12924,hrs3pj,That’s why it’s up to us to organize and to actually do the things we can in those 4 years. A Trump second term is absolutely destructive for any labor organizing and left political action. It’s better to use the failures of a Biden administration to get people to realize the problems aren’t just republicans (fascists).
12925,hrs3pj,"If many Americans feel that way, then they feel that way. We *want* a democracy"
12926,hrs3pj,"People like you are why leftist don’t win elections

You can’t tell the difference between a fascist and a moderate"
12927,hrs3pj,"Sure, that’s just electoral politics though, it’s not materially going to yield much improvement in the authoritarian character of our state. Voting isn’t enough to push this country away from authoritarian rule."
12928,hrs3pj,"Fake news, clearly

/s"
12929,hrs3pj,"Bernie was the compromise of many people. I do not agree with it, but I respect it.

You don't respect leftists not voting for a right winger, even in states we're their vote isn't needed (deep colour states where most real progressives live.

Biden is a loss for any leftist, and they have every right to complain and reaffirm they will push left and left after Biden is elected

So shut the fuck up, with all due respect attacking me because you ran out if arguments and have to pin strawman on me (I never defended Trump)."
12930,hrs3pj,"Shut the fuck up. The worst case scenario is Trump winning.

The only thing keeping him in check is being concerned with re-election. That's it. What the hell do you think he's going to do when ""Will this get me re-elected?"" is no longer a factor? What about when it becomes ""How do I stay in power at all coats?""

You fuckers are so go damned short sighted that you can't look past your own ""waaaahhhhh neolibrul bad!"" hate boner to see that we may NOT have any more elections if trump stays in power.

God. Damn."
12931,hrs3pj,Refer to my previous comment.
12932,hrs3pj,"if trump is still the president then the government will collapse, so then well have anarchy for a little bit, so i mean thats like the only good thing we get from trump being president lol"
12933,hrs3pj,Yeaaah but it’s not a *good* thing
12934,hrs3pj,"People always seem to use academic accelerationism and colloquial accelerationism as the same thing even though they are barely similar, it's really weird"
12935,hrs3pj,"TIL accelerationism is a thing. 

Left accelerationism, from the Wiki definition seems to be using technological progress and Renaissance to overstretch the economic boundaries of capitalism to its breaking point. 

To me that sounds like HAHA BIG SPACE ROCKET GO BRRRRR to the point of ""please sir I need Healthcare"" and then the left goes ""SEE I TOLD YOU CAPITALISM IS UNSUSTAINABLE!!1""

NGL it's pretty based."
12936,hrs3pj,"I would say I have some accellerationist tendencies, but not in that I want to increase oppression, even temporarily. It's just that in this election for example, we have a choice between two fascists. One is extremely unpopular. I would prefer to keep the unpopular fascist in charge, not only because there's a chance that revolution could occur, but because history has shown many times over the dangers of popular fascists. I would never vote for a fascist, but I don't have an obligation to do anything about it either since I haven't been offered any choice to."
12937,hrs3pj,"I am of the unprovable opinion that this is more due to capitalism’s failures than Trump.  Capitalism’s flaws have been put on display with the climate crises, brutal treatment of immigrants, covid, and police racism. 

I don’t think the leftist energy would die down if Biden was elected, as all these capitalistic flaws will continue to exist. Amazon is still gonna fuck their warehouse workers, the climate will continue to get warmer, police will continue to be racist. The public has awakened and won’t go back to sleep so easily."
12938,hrs3pj,"Yeah I mean anecdotally I've been looking more into leftism, I've had conversations with conservatives about concepts like UBI or co-ops, lots of conversations about how the US isn't the poster child for the best place to live.

Then you look at what's been happening at a national level.

I can't think of anything that Trump has done outside of weakening the US position on the world stage. He hasn't done anything worse than any other president (with what little power they even have) and aside from pandering to fascists and fueling some fires, he hasn't directly *done* all that much. 

Another 4 years of US being the laughingstock of the world, Trump saying whatever bullshit comes into his head without doing anything, and enraging more liberals/revisionists sounds like it *could* be better than 4 years of a liberal reinforcing liberalism and the US position among liberal nations and being a lullaby that puts the proletariat back to sleep"
12939,hrs3pj,"Eh, I don't think that fully represents the issue.  I mean what's more common sense than ""it's better to rip the band-aid off quickly because dragging it out hurts more""?

I don't think it's a gamble to say that were are going to see widespread human misery in the future regardless of the next election's outcome.  Big picture, the longer capitalism is allowed to exist the worst our climate outcomes are going to be, the higher the death toll is likely to be.  Who is to say that letting the system limp along won't result in more deaths than an immediate and dramatic end?

Don't get me wrong, I am not an accelerationist but I also I don't think it's as clear cut as you portray it.  I think the real issue at hand is the fact by endorsing accelerationism you are in effect participating in the death of people, rather than just being a victim of the system doing it's thing by continuing to do what's seems to mitigate human suffering in the moment."
12940,hrs3pj,"Unfortunately common sense isn't helpful when deciding who is better for this country in the long run, a fascist or a liberal."
12941,hrs3pj,+1. All the flaws of capitalism would continue to be on display with or without trump. I doubt Clinton would have effectively stopped the bleeding.
12942,hrs3pj,Yeah who knows
12943,hrs3pj,Apparently biden will be a bandaid which will cause it to fester but burning it down is somehow better.
12944,hrs3pj,"Not even socialists. 

Social democrat policies are wanted by a majority of all US Americans, yet none of the parties will embrace them because they are both right wing.

My mentality is reality. You're seeing a mirror of society, liberals pretend to be left while killing it."
12945,hrs3pj,"Maybe read the entire comment before acting like you know how I'm voting. I was explaining the reasoning, not supporting it."
12946,hrs3pj,"Obama killed iraqis and afghans and Syrians and lybians instead, I guess."
12947,hrs3pj,HRC has been working actively advocating war with Iran for years. And let's not pretend she liked Obama a bit.
12948,hrs3pj,"I think if you only realized Trump is bad due to covid your political and ethical senses are almost dead.

He was clearly horrible before being elected and most decisions were horribly senseless"
12949,hrs3pj,"You're too simplistic. Voting them out won't change their growth. 

If you remove bad weeds from the surface, you also need to remove their seeds and roots form the ground or they'll grow again, stronger."
12950,hrs3pj,We did. It involves the end of bipartisanship and pushing left all time over the Biden presidency
12951,hrs3pj,Biden being more progressive than a guy from the 40s. That's just bad.
12952,hrs3pj,He's the status quo that bred Trump. So he isn't fascist but he creates them.
12953,hrs3pj,"Not to mention that Mike Pence, the NEXT MAN IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION, would want to see many LGBT people tortured for who they are. Biden sucks, but at least he isn’t nominating an open homophobe for VP.

Well hopefully he isn’t. 2020 could still surprise us."
12954,hrs3pj,"The neolib will do the same, but only to minorities while acting sad about doing it. Plus keep foreign wars.

Y'all need to stop acting like Biden is your saviour."
12955,hrs3pj,"This is the fundamental disconnect I guess. 

Neoliberalism is the Petri dish for fascism. And US neoliberalism with the lens of neoconservative foreign policy is not far from fascism. 

A DNC in support of imperialism, mass deportations, mass privatization of public services, and just as vociferously spewing xenophobic (rusophobic and sinophobic) propaganda is not an opponent of fascism. A DNC whose starting position is we have to try and work with the fascist party. A DNC signing the budget for concentration camps is a fascist collaborator. A presidential candidate saying yah we should train cops to shoot to maim, is not antifascist. A DNC who cheered on the Iraq War is not antifascist."
12956,hrs3pj,[deleted]
12957,hrs3pj,"I disagree, I think a vote for Biden is an antifascist vote. I just don’t like the idea of accusing Americans of treason just for not voting."
12958,hrs3pj,"Sure, but it also requires extensive pressure during the campaign to push biden to do things too, and part of that is not being an in-pocket voter."
12959,hrs3pj,"I mean, the first trump term has actually been a pretty huge fucking boon to left organizing, which is the crux of the acceleratiomist argument."
12960,hrs3pj,Bernie isn’t a Leftist
12961,hrs3pj,Leftism will never win elections. Do you think elections are fair? The ruling class would install a dictatorship first. Elections are not how leftism wins.
12962,hrs3pj,"Oh hell no, this vote is not the end all be all. So much work needs to be done, I completely agree. But it’s extremely needed and I keep seeing people say Biden is just like Trump and that is simply not true. Trump is the authoritarian flesh eating virus where Biden is just an ordinary flu. Both are not something you want, but one is quite less severe."
12963,hrs3pj,"I prefer a right winger to a fascist that tries to take away the right of trans people. At least the right winger's party have a facade of wokeness that cause them to not get rid of the right of some minority groups.


I ""ran out of argument""? Are you sure you just don't comprehend them. Oh and yeah you are kinda enabling Trump. You don't vote, ergo you don't make a choice and that cause Trump to have a better chance to win. I'm a consequentialist, I don't care what you believe personally, I care about the consequences of the choice you make."
12964,hrs3pj,"The worst case scenario is electing Biden and thinking ""fascism is no more"". Because then it will only grow.

The USA needs very deep refund and then a lot of time to regenerate, and Biden won't do it."
12965,hrs3pj,Do you understand what the human cost of a complete government collapse would be?
12966,hrs3pj,"It wouldn't be anarchy, it would be chaos."
12967,hrs3pj,Academic accelerationism is also terrible but has nothing to do with the colloquial accelerationism.
12968,hrs3pj,I think that most people (including me) have no idea what academic accelerationism is.
12969,hrs3pj,"I think there’s a difference between an imperialist and a fascist. Biden is imperialist, and he has supported a couple fascistic policies in the past (crime bill, patriot act) but he’s overall a solid neoliberal, not a fascist. 

Meanwhile Trump has threatened to invade Seattle with the US Military."
12970,hrs3pj,You don't think there is a possibility of fascists winning the revolution? I don't think enough people in america are aware or even support socialist ideals. Many liberals I know really don't like what happened in Seattle with CHOP. We need a broad coalition to fight fascism
12971,hrs3pj,People don't see capitalist failure until it affects them.
12972,hrs3pj,It will get marginally better and then it's gonna be worse then before.
12973,hrs3pj,He's replaced a bunch of federal judges. Also revoked a bunch of environmental protections.
12974,hrs3pj,"You misunderstood. I'm not trying to portray it as clear cut or simple, I'm saying it's important to look at this or any problem *through that lens*, to check what makes sense on first instinct, to think sans possible overthinking, for the sake of perspective. Whether it still seems like a good idea or not after assessing other ways of thinking, that's not my point at all. I'm saying not to forget to consider it from a simple perspective *also*.

But aside from that it's false to assume the demolition of the current system of capitalism will likely allow for an improvement. Just (fair) socialism isn't the logical next step from a blank slate and untested government, nor historically. Besides that, it would take the whole global economy to come down or else we would just be like Cuba or something, having to really severely rely on ourselves and scant allies and resources. I'm not saying it wouldn't be noble or worth trying, but as for ripping off a band aid... Make sure you're also able to form blood clots."
12975,hrs3pj,"I disagree. I think it especially applies in this case. The idea of voting Trump in order to accelerate total collapse of the state is a perfect example of overthinking it. It sounds... Kind of good ""on paper"", but it breaks down with even the least bit of in-depth consideration. It's just a weird variation on the very idea that tricked people into supporting Trump directly: the idea that he would reform government. He's wild fire. Not controlled fire. That's why it's common sense. You have to be overthinking it or relying on some really hokey propositions to think it would work out. The chances are about as slim as they were for Trump actually doing a good job. It's the epitome of ""yeah that sounds like a terrible idea"". That's why it's important to listen to your gut and not some conspiracy theory kind of logic. Just think, clearly and smoothly, screw the Rube Goldberg-esque schemes of how things could go. Every form of experience shows it almost always fails. If you're not that person yourself, don't you know that person who always has some success scheme that he has all the ""logic"" for but it always fails miserably, and obviously? This is that."
12976,hrs3pj,"But if a Dem was at the helm when they became clear, I think more people would embrace the alt-right than find their way to leftism."
12977,hrs3pj,"More like ""cut the arm to stop the infection, treating symptoms won't solve it""

I don't agree, but don't strawman."
12978,hrs3pj,Shit... my bad. I misread for the progressive or nobody.
12979,hrs3pj,"well phew, it's a good thing that Trump has only dronestriked Iran's top general and tore up the treaty preventing them from renuclearizing."
12980,hrs3pj,[deleted]
12981,hrs3pj,That's the cure to brainworms? Okay.
12982,hrs3pj,He is the most progressive candidate.
12983,hrs3pj,The way this year's been going...
12984,hrs3pj,How does one weigh torturing a few lgbt people stateside against killing thousands of brown people abroad? I dunno. The best outcome is Biden PLUS revolution.
12985,hrs3pj,Biden’s policies aren’t directly targeting minorities while trump’s do. He isn’t our savior hell he isn’t even our compromise but he’s the hand we’re dealt and we’ll have to live with that until the next time we can pull the Overton window further left.
12986,hrs3pj,"Xenophobia, police, and foreign wars has been a hallmark of America since this country was formed.  Liberalism has always been freedom for some but not for everyone, especially not for non-citizens or racial minorities. I dislike liberalism for these reasons but it’s still not necessarily fascism. 

I do agree that liberalism can easily slide into fascism, as is evident by WW2, and people like Tom Cotton and Trump today. I also agree that the DNC is not antifascist, they often act like appeasers.  But a vote for Biden is an attempt to at least stop that slide to the right, and allows us non-elites to continue antifascist work (and not be declared terrorists).

If Trump is elected again I really believe this is all over.  We already see him illegally using emergency powers to try and build a wall, we see him attempting to declare antifa a terrorist organization, and we see his team sharing Nazi imagery on social media.  If he is elected again, I fully expect Stephen Miller to pull a Riechstag Fire and go hard on antifascist and socialist repression."
12987,hrs3pj,Don’t have an Opinion if you’re not willing to back in up in Real Life.
12988,hrs3pj,"Existential nihilism is centrism, confirmed."
12989,hrs3pj,"I don’t see voting impacting most aspects of fascism in america. There is a harm reduction argument to voting, but anti-fascism is inherently about hamstringing fascist movements before they ever get to the voting box, i.e. actions that take place outside of electoralism.

Again, I am not arguing against the harm-reduction argument, just saying I wouldn’t expect the country to make much progress away from authoritarianism if our votes are taken for granted. Materially, the vote seems to be quite low-value and only gains value when Biden listens to his potential left wing. Has Biden promised to end treatment of imprisoning illegal immigrants in camps quickly approaching death camps? Defund the police? Defund the military and state intelligence? Disband ICE and the DHS? Set goals for reducing the prison population? End domestic surveillance? End our use of imperialist propaganda? Remember that Obama ran in 2008 on closing Guantanamo and ended up being the furthest-right democrat of my life (certainly further right than Clinton). These are all relatively trivial signals that biden even knows what fascism *is*, let alone that he will work against it, and he’s not going to make them if he thinks your vote is in the bag."
12990,hrs3pj,"Trump hasn’t fully taken over the government yet. Four more years and that might change. How difficult do you think leftist organizing would be if he shut down left organizations, actually went after anyone with antifascist views, and put the military on our streets?"
12991,hrs3pj,Yes till he gets his wish and starts executing antifa as terrorists.
12992,hrs3pj,The conditions under Biden will allow more leftists to come to power then conditions under trump
12993,hrs3pj,"And apparently a large part of the the left would take a fascist over a moderate, this Bernie or bust shit harms people

If trump wins the Supreme Court will be stacked for generations as well trans And queer right being eroded"
12994,hrs3pj,"You are making wrong assumptions again, I am voting, but I understand people that don't, or people voting Green. Shut up, or learn how to read."
12995,hrs3pj,"to be honest, not really. but itd be funny to watch trump tweeting acting like its still ""his country"""
12996,hrs3pj,"you win, i couldnt think of anything, heres an upvote"
12997,hrs3pj,"Exactly, I think they're both bad, but they're really different"
12998,hrs3pj,"Extremely TL;DR

Accelerationism: Technological progress is getting faster. Capitalism always needs some time to co-opt something, but people are faster. If we can speed up technological progress, we might be able ro ""outrun"" capitalism or find a breaking point. (I'm not an accelerationist, so if this sounds silly, it's because I don't have terribly much respect for it. I do respect some accelerationists, though - read Mark Fisher!)

Accelerationism as used on the internet: Capitalism always heads for crisis, and crisis is when revolution might happen. So let's do shitty things to speed that up - let's vote for the crassest capitalist we can find so that the cruelty of the situation cannot be cushioned anymore. I also don't have terribly much respect for that line of thought, to be honest."
12999,hrs3pj,Also the whole concentration camp thing
13000,hrs3pj,"I’m not so sure about that. I think a lot of people embraced the alt-right because they were mad at a black president, and then Trump egging them on. 

I don’t see as many people will doing that with an old white guy in charge. I do expect the alt right to continue to grow, but not necessarily outpace the left."
13001,hrs3pj,"That's literally the argument being made though.  The running them on r/wayofthebern is with trump we could have a progressive candidate in 4 years but Biden will likely be president for 8 years, and the incremental fixes likely won't lead to a progressive candidate like trumps second term would."
13002,hrs3pj,"Yeah that's obviously horrible and he almost did go to war with them. But the one ""outsider"" quality he's maintained is somewhat less interventionism. Hillary is a war hawk plain and simple"

13005,hrs3pj,"I don't follow. I assume this is a knock on Biden supporting the Iraq war? Because that behavior isn't different from any GOP candidate. So the correct choices to weigh against each other are: killing thousands of brown people abroad, vs killing thousands of brown people abroad *and* persecuting LGBTQ people stateside."

13011,hrs3pj,Burst out laughing reading this lmao. You got brain worms lib
13012,hrs3pj,"Voting for Biden as harm reduction is fine, it's just important to remember that it doesn't really constitute a 'win'. The way leftism gets real wins is through direct action and local organizing. Pinning all our hopes on a presidential candidate is a recipe for failure."
13013,hrs3pj,"This shit is my big worry. I joke about getting sent to the gas chamber, but I still stay up at night thinking of how much another four years of Trump would mean my life would be in more danger than it already is. It's so frustrating because my life is on the line, along with all of my comrades in my community. Do these fuckers care, no. They just want to be mad about Bernie not winning. I live in fear being known as trans would get me killed, I'm planning to throw everything I worked for away to start somewhere I can live as myself. This Burnie or bust shit will kill people."
13014,hrs3pj,"Sigh, so aggressive my dude."
13015,hrs3pj,That too. The children been kidnapped or separated from their parents will likely have trauma that will last much longer than Trumps term or life.
13016,hrs3pj,"The theme is mixed. Some accelerationists and some people honestly just complaining about Biden to try to move the Dems left.

Like, Biden could get all leftist bite with weed decriminalization, Green New Deal and M4A. But he's a moron."

13021,hrs3pj,"Well dead people cant change much cant they? Or do you think you have enough people in america that will help antifa. You know those evil people in black that kill free speech activists. 
If you think he will come for all leftist at the same time look at german history. How many open and active socialist do you have in america? Enough to fight agains the state? Even if you manage against the police enough to win against the military? All trump supporters? The civil war and uncertantiy that comes with it? Without a broad base that supports leftist economic values you will loose or become a tyranny like so many other revolutions."
13022,hrs3pj,"Who is talking about Obama? Biden is the next candidate.

>Wealthy Businesses Burned under Obama

You are doing socialism wrong."
13023,hrs3pj,"As much as I love black Marxist militias, that is not the only way to measure the success of leftism

Many expansive social programs and policies were made law under Obama ( there also many protests of military action in the Middle East as well)"
13024,hrs3pj,Let’s make things worse for minorities as long as it doesn’t harm me/s
13025,hrs3pj,Because there were no leftist movements under Obama.
13026,hrs3pj,Comparing 2008 to 2020 is foolish. In 2008 calling yourself a socialist was political suicide. Not anymore. People have woken up to the horrors of capitalism and they won’t go back to sleep so easily.
13027,hrs3pj,"I love your Tag so damn much, Comrade.

This is the Culture we need to Foster. Anyways, love you fam."
13028,hrs3pj,"I would have to say getting trump out of office is a win for the left

As for direct action and local organization, I know this. But if you don’t vote in every election, if you don’t push for the most progressive platform possible then you let people like trump take power"
13029,hrs3pj,"It’s a win for the left, because four more years of Trump could have the military invading major cities to repress leftist momentum."
13030,hrs3pj,"This is all semantics. It seems like you believe Biden is better than Trump. 

In my view anything that is a net positive, no matter how small, is a win and should be celebrated.  That’s just a difference in defining the word “win”.

Voting is like the smallest least important aspect of our political lives, but it should be done. People should feel free to feel positively about even very, very small wins, as long as they keep working and don’t become complacent."
13031,hrs3pj,"So will not applying enough pressure to Biden to revive the democratic party. So will the DNC for forcing the worst possible candidate down our throats against a fascist. So will a third of america by refusing to engage in the political process at all.

If anything is going to kill Biden’s campaign looking at poll numbers it’d have to be biden—he’s been leading polls with a healthy margin for a bit now.

You can redirect blame multiple directions & feeding neoliberal and conservative fuel by agreeing to blame solely the bernie or bust folk, who likely DGAF what you have to say anyway. Fact is you are more valuable to everyone by not committing your vote to Biden even if you do fully intend on voting for him."

13036,hrs3pj,"Oh dude tyranny is absolutely happening no matter who wins at this point. The ruling class have effectively cemented a closed circuit of power. Either trump wins and all the stuff you said happens, or Biden wins, nothing changes, and 4 years later we get a competent fascist. Those are our options."
13037,hrs3pj,"Ok, you’re not a Socialist at all, you’re a SocDem"
13038,hrs3pj,"If you’ve ever actually read Marx or Lenin, which you haven’t, you’d know Social Democracy is a Rouse put up by Capital. It’s not actual Advancement."
13039,hrs3pj,"A Biden term will be way better for minorities than a 2nd Trump term. This whole idea of another fascist worse than Trump after a Biden term hasn’t been substantiated, and is just an excuse not to vote for Biden because your ass hurts that Bernie lost the primary. Quit being an entitled white prick and vote in November. Unless your a European. If that’s the case, then shut the hell up. Quit talking about American politics and go back to fixing your own shitty European country."
13040,hrs3pj,"True, he suppressed them with militarized police and the national guard."
13041,hrs3pj,What year would you compare to? It seems weird to assume the past no longer applies because things feel different.
13042,hrs3pj,"I think you took a bit too much from that comment and I'm not sure how threatening to give my vote to a fascist is going to help anyone. I wish Bernie won, too, but this isn't some political game to me because I die if Trump wins.

I don't know where you got that I was only blaming Burnie or bust people. I'm frustrated with having to vote for someone like Biden. I'm a libertarian socialist (social anarchist), I'm not getting much on the way of governing representation in a good election. The DNC can basically ignore my views, they're not going to make much headway on a national scale any time soon. 

This is about life or death for me, my comrades, my siblings in my community, my own life are my drive. Helping them is all that matters to me right now, playing politics isn't. 

Also of course angry teenagers don't give a fuck what I have to say, they're mostly to privileged to care."

13062,cs9h30,"Someone said on Twitter “they put the handicapped in the front like isis hides in villages so we can’t bomb them” and I got so pissed (as a disabled person), I said “are we not humans to you? Are we not sentient beings capable of our own fucking decisions? Also wheelchair users must be in the front so they can see, don’t run over peoples feet, and so you don’t get pushed around by being in the middle."

13122,cs9h30,"I agree with you. Unfortunately this guy ended up getting arrested. There are photos of it over on r/Portland. The police in Portland always take the nazis side.

So, basically people who use snowflake as an insult are quoting a domestic terrorist who blows up skyscrapers because he's insecure about how good he is in bed.

13181,cs9h30,"It’s a mix I’d think. Communists have always been some of the first to fight against fascism, but I’m sure there are people from many different beliefs here. Hating Nazis shouldn’t be exclusive to any political party or ideology."
13182,cs9h30,"Some of us are, and some are even a sort of combination of the two! I can’t speak for all Marxists. From my perspective, despite the ideological differences between us, most Marxists/communists and anarchists don’t tolerate fascism or capitalism as a whole. This makes it logical to work together to fight fascism. Both groups have also been targeted historically by fascists, so they have that in common."
13183,cs9h30,"To be fair, my political ideology will always lean on the left, but I feel like being antifa is more of a duty that every good citizen should support more than a political ideology"

13188,cs9h30,"“America” as an institution, I’d like to think the national ideals have shifted left post-civil rights. Clearly there’s racism, but I feel like some die-hands have a boner for manifest destiny and the rest of our trash history. It could turn into a whole debate, but we can all agree institutional America is inherently fascist"
13189,cs9h30,Probably are.  Anarchism is the left side of communism.  A system without hierarchy.  You can still be a patriot and be an anarchist.  They two are not mutually exclusive.
13190,cs9h30,Nope.

13197,cs9h30,"Snowflake? When people use the term snowflake just remember they're quoting Fight Club, a satire written by a gay man about how male fragility causes men to destroy themselves, resent society, and become radicalized, and that Tyler Durden isnt the hero but a personification of the main characters mental illness, and that his snowflake speech is a dig at how fascists use dehumanizing language to breed loyalty from insecure people. So, basically people who use snowflake as an insult are quoting a domestic terrorist who blows up skyscrapers because he's insecure about how good he is in bed.

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-less-lovely-side-of-snowflake)

[ In Missouri in the early 1860s, a 'snowflake' was a person who was opposed to the abolition of slavery—the implication of the name being that such people valued white people over black people. This use seems not to have endured. ]"
13199,cs9h30,can i have a link?
13200,cs9h30,"While I am not a fan of Chuck Palahniuk as a person, I have read Fight Club many times and I still think the message stands on its own and is incredibly relevant. And unironically using the term 'snowflake' still shows a great ignorance on the themes of the book and Tyler Durden as a character. It shows how capitalism and consumerism turns into fascism. But I can see how people wouldn't like it anymore because of Palahniuk's views now. Serious question, was he always like that? Or did he change over time? I was really disappointed when I heard him on Joe Rogan."

13211,cs9h30,"Ugh. I stumbled upon his tweets over the weekend of Portland. Man he makes my head hurt. He shared the ""hammer attack"" unedited, and promptly got ripped to shreds by anyone with a brain. The amount of tweets directing him to watch the video's beginning made my day."

he's neither."

I am aware.

>You can still be a patriot and be an anarchist.

You have a funny idea of what patriotism is. We advocate for the total dissolution of nation-states. If that's patriotism, then water is dry I guess."
13215,cs9h30,"Yes. They are likely Anarchists.

See the Sickle and Hammer?  Anarchism is a form of communism.  Its like the final level where humanity needs no hierarchies any longer.  Its not lets go out and burn shit and riot, that's not anarchy.

i am sorry for writing ""normal person"", ableism dehumanizing the disabled wasn't my intention, i also have connective tissue abnormalities myself."
13225,cs9h30,"Definitely depends on where you were and when you were there. I was never along Yamhill (where based spartan and that guy with the hammer were) so I can’t speak to that. As for the park (where the event was held) it was mostly confrontations with the police we were looking at. The scariest moment for me was when we were gathered under the overpass and the Riot Cops rushed us. I’d been cuffed once before in Chicago in a Black Lives Matter Protest and I wasn’t looking forward to it again. They punched a guy off his bike and I think really hurt him. I followed Robert Evans around for a bit (from Behind the Bastards fame. His account on Twitter is a good place to check if you want to see Play by play stuff.) as well as the two people in the wheel chairs (whose names I will not disclose) and the shirtless guy in the photo (whose name I never got). He was very instrumental in the whole protests success. Whenever an Alt-lite was singled out he would get in their face and call them out, but never hit them. He was eventually beaten and arrested by riot cops as we chased a family of militia types with swastikas (they eventually got covered in mayo) after that I got separated from Black Bloc by a line of Bike cops. I’m not from Portland and wasn’t exactly masked up (I’m a photojournalist, so while I was definitely there as an antifascist, I wanted to be able to get close to cops and fascists without getting hit).

As far as mood, everyone I talked to was super nice. Serious, but nice. I got a protective mask from a Black Bloc member  to protect from tear gas (which I saw none of, but the willingness to share was appreciated, plus at that point who knew what was coming). If you was a Play by play of the whole thing check out Robert Evans, or @IWriteOk, on Twitter. I’ll also be posting my photos tomorrow on various appropriate subreddits so look out for those.

TLDR: There were some scary bits and I wasn’t there for everything, but the moment of solidarity and bravery made up for it. I’ll be posting photos soon."

13228,cs9h30,"I'm a medic, I dont ""beat people up"" anymore. Does this mean I don't stand up to fascism?????"
13229,cs9h30,Have you ever even been to a protest? It’s mostly standing around while people play drums. Protesting isn’t inherently violent. You should really go to one sometime so you can see for yourself.
13230,cs9h30,Anarchism and communism are not even close.

13241,cs9h30,Wait? Atheists really did that? I feel like I live under a rock sometimes.
13242,cs9h30,"I’m lucky. I’m a very poor college student, but a decent photojournalist, which gets me places. This is the first I’d gone to in Portland, but I plan on going to more along the west coast. I’m currently working out plans to travel to Rojava in Syria for around 9 months, but that won’t be until about 2021. Its one of those things where I’ve kinda always traveled, so it’s nice to be able to do it so much."

13246,cs9h30,Thank you for correcting me!
13247,cs9h30,"snowflake? When people use the term snowflake just remember they're quoting Fight Club, a satire written by a gay man about how male fragility causes men to destroy themselves, resent society, and become radicalized, and that Tyler Durden isnt the hero but a personification of the main characters mental illness, and that his snowflake speech is a dig at how fascists use dehumanizing language to breed loyalty from insecure people. So, basically people who use snowflake as an insult are quoting a domestic terrorist who blows up skyscrapers because he's insecure about how good he is in bed.

13249,cs9h30,"Yeaaa. Sargon of akward, armored sceptic, thunderf00t, king crocoduck to name  a few. Which is ironic because religion suppressing atheism is a right wing problem and they went alt right.  I respect those that stayed in atheist topics."

13261,hsuop7,Yes but DAE Holodomor? The only famine in human history occurred under communism! Humans would be immortal if we were all just capitalists
13262,hsuop7,What is the actual statistic?
13263,hsuop7,Fuck Stalin

13267,hsuop7,"This meme, while ostensibly about Stalin, is actually about the current world record holder, the USA. I can't believe this has to be explained."

13273,hsuop7,Which in return of course excuses the horrific conditions in the gulags.
13274,hsuop7,I always wonder if people who post memes like this understand that in a lot of places in the world they either just execute people or don't report the numbers of people they're holding
13275,hsuop7,Stalin was a terrible capitalist. but This meme is real
13276,hsuop7,Who currently has the highest prison population?
13277,hsuop7,"I don’t like any totalitarian regime. That includes the USSR. Neither of these two superpowers were good.

13281,hsuop7,Ughh what. Currently 0.7% of US population is in prison. That's 0.03% of worlds population. The majority are there for breaking laws whereas people where sent to the gulags for runnung successful small farms or posing a perceived threat to stalin.

Easier numbers in the form of prisoners per 100,000 inhabitants show the US topping even places like Turkmenistan or Rwanda.

(The Seychelles could potentially have a higher incarceration rate, but that place only got 90,000 citizens, so the incarceration rate fluctuates heavily)

13296,hsuop7,"To be fair I don't the meme glorifies Stalin so much as pokes holes in the kind of exceptionalism practiced by capitalists to the point that it's just assumed they're incapable of committing worse atrocities than the Soviet Union. Of course Stalin was a despot, but the U.S.S.R. is constantly held up as the paragon of modern evil while the institutions condemning it backslide into fascism with zero self-awareness."
13297,hsuop7,Fuck Stalinist Russia and fuck the US prison system. We can say both.
13298,hsuop7,...yeah.... that's like..the whole point
13299,hsuop7,wait isn't that literally just what the meme says?
13300,hsuop7,I mean yeah Stalin was just a fascist character class with a leftist skin
13301,hsuop7,">not a leftist

Stalin followed pretty leninist principle until the mid/late 30s, no?"
13302,hsuop7,How old are you?
13303,hsuop7,Meme still correct

13305,hsuop7,"This could be a libleft meme.

13311,hsuop7,That has nothing to do with the meme.

13313,hsuop7,"It says ""World's entire **prison** population"". It´s not the percentage of the world´s population but the percentage of the World's population that is in prison. No one is spreading lies."

13319,hsuop7,"American right wingers (and right wingers in general) have such a binarised world view that, to them, you *have* to choose between a capitalist dystopia and a “communist” dystopia. Add some cold war propaganda that equates Stalinism with communism, and there’s why you can’t have this discussion with them. You point out the flaws in the American system, and they immediately accuse you of being a Stalinist. If you say that you dislike both, it means you’re a utopian, because those two are the only systems that exist. We’re all fucked."

13323,hsuop7,Thanks but I mean about Soviet Union under Stalin. I want to have something to counter when folks try to make it  sound like The Evilest Empire Ever
13324,hsuop7,"100%, Capitalism is based on us looking away because we manage to achieve all our needs without much effort."
13325,hsuop7,I mean you can hate the US without defending the USSR and hate the USSR without defending the US. Antifascism means you're against fascism no matter the location.
13326,hsuop7,"LOL. Yes but it didn't show on my phone. Interestingly, another link claims 25 percent."
13327,hsuop7,"Yes, but that part is hidden (at least, when browsing with the phone app)"
13328,hsuop7,Literally no he was a die hard marxist leninist till the end. Even bougeoise historians when plunging through soviet archives of stalin's personal shit thought they'd find stuff to prove he was some kind of grifter except they didnt and instead found that he was a die hard
13329,hsuop7,"Did he implement democratic ownership of the means of production directly by the workers? Or did he implement totalitarian state-capitalism? Did he have direct democracy or did he have a one party system only appointed people could join? Did he push for egalitarianism or did he support a social hierarchy?

No, these people aren't Leftists sorry. I will say Lenin was, but was way to attached to the state and capitalism (you can call it whatever you want, it was capitalism) so in practice he wasn't in theory Lenin was."
13330,hsuop7,Post hog
13331,hsuop7,"Leftism has such a complicated history because it needs to be seen in the context of constant revolution. It's a difficult thing to navigate, always feeling like I need to defend the USSR against American liberals. On one hand I dont idolize Stalin in the slightest. On another, I can't just let false equivalencies go unchecked, especially when conversing with someone who has a viewpoint based in American Exceptionalism.

When you compare the tragedies that happened under Stalin's rapid industrialization policies, they really don't look too much different than what has occured under Western liberal governments over a marginally longer period of time."
13332,hsuop7,USA! USA! USA!
13333,hsuop7,I'm telling you Stalinist isn't Marxist Leninism. Its Stalinism. He basically enacted a coup after Lenin died.

13335,hsuop7,Just a hunch.. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge
13336,hsuop7,I misread it but the meme is still false. China is today imprisoning up to 2 million ethnic muslims in concentration camps. Thats the same as the entire US prison population
13337,hsuop7,Read slower
13338,hsuop7,"Agreed but I constantly get bashed here for being a soc dem, and the people in this sub worship Stalin and deny any wrongdoing. Why does this whole sub conflate anti fascism with outright Soviet communism if what you say is true."
13339,hsuop7,I'd take the Soviet Union over Modern China any day of the week
13340,hsuop7,Social democrats supporting actual anarchism can criticise entitled kids thinking that they need to complain about anticapitalist memes just because Stalin appears on them.

That's the source for the 

> The US incarceration rate peaked in 2008 when about 1 in 100 US adults was behind bars.[26] This incarceration rate exceeded the average incarceration levels in the Soviet Union during the existence of the infamous Gulag system, when the Soviet Union's population reached 168 million, and 1.2 to 1.5 million people were in the Gulag prison camps and colonies (i.e. about 0.8 imprisoned per 100 USSR residents, according to numbers from Anne Applebaum and Steven Rosefielde).

quote from Wikipedia.




It gets even worse: German concentration camps had a number of 1.65 million registered prisoners (this excludes everyone directly murdered, hence lower than the number of people murdered in the Holocaust).

The population of German controlled areas during that time exceeded 80 million.

So even the extreme amount of incarceration of political prisoners and others they didn't intend to just genocide right away was 2% of the minimum population.

However these 80 millions only include the 1939 census numbers. Concentration camp prisoners were taken from Vichy France as well for example, so the population Germany sourced it's prisoners from might have been quite a bit higher.

Which would bring down the 2% rate to closer to 1%. 

Which makes me incredulous. How can a country that is so virulently brainwashed into 'muh freedom' accept rates of imprisonment even remotely close to Nazi German terror?





Here in Germany, the GDR is always thought of first for evil imprisonment greedy places.

With everyone knowing of the Stasi Secret police imprisoning people for trying to leave the country or speaking out against the state.

However the actual numbers were 2500 people being disappeared on average each year, for a population of 16 million. So 0.01 percent of the population was in prison for political reasons, with the remainder following regular law.

If you compare the US number for black people imprisoned for victimless drug crimes, which I consider political prisoners as well, it shows a bleak picture of the US."
13342,hsuop7,"It was just Stalin who was an evil MOFO, everyone else was just tryin to survive"
13343,hsuop7,"Shit, I didn't actually see that before i saw your comment and went back and clicked the picture to show the bottom text. Thanks man."
13344,hsuop7,You're real close to getting the point
13345,hsuop7,"He did implement democracy actually, it was a republic run by workers councils. Stalin only had 1/6 of the vote on the central committee just because it isnt your version of democracy doesn't mean it isnt democracy."
13346,hsuop7,So you say Lenins wasn't a leftist because he introduced the NEP and thus Stalin wasn't a leftist either because he continued these policies?
13347,hsuop7,“Totalitarian state capitalism” here we have someone who has no idea what they are talking about
13348,hsuop7,Don't threaten me with a good time
13349,hsuop7,No he didn't and stalinism isnt a real thing its marxism leninism and the written works hes given to ml are actually really great
13350,hsuop7,Gorillions*
13351,hsuop7,Lmao the sources for that article are ridiculously biased.
13352,hsuop7,"US prison population is 2.3m. Best Estimates for total Chinese prison population including reeducation centers is 2.3m.  

Even with it's horrible human rights violations, China has 1/4  the incarceration rate of the US."
13353,hsuop7,"In addition to what erath_droid said...

22% in the USA + 22% in China = 44% leaving 56% to be divided up amoung the rest of the world.

Also it's not particularly flattering if the best comparison you can make is ""our country only has as many prisoners as the country our country regularly calls the most despotic country in the world, despite that country having 4 times our population which means we have a 4 times higher incarnation rate."""
13354,hsuop7,"Ah, shitburgers"
13355,hsuop7,Wait when did this become a tankie sub?
13356,hsuop7,"Ehh, you gotta remember that only the devote, vocal Tankies are going to take the time to reply to your posts, the moderates do not feel so passionate about the subject. Don't let them warp your view of the entire sub!"
13357,hsuop7,People here don't worship Stalin. That's why you get called out
13358,hsuop7,"While I have a lot of problems with social democrats and their policies and their past but this is just an antifascist subreddit so you're welcome to stay as long as you're an antifascist.

13366,hsuop7,We ain't fucking fascists.
13367,hsuop7,So there was direct democracy and you could just join the party and didn't have to be appointed in?
13368,hsuop7,This dodges my point and questions.
13369,hsuop7,"You need to learn more about Stalin. 

https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-behind-the-bastards-29236323/episode/the-childhood-of-joseph-stalin-57114487/

This is a great start from an incredibly leftist podcast. If you keep listening through the episodes they also touch on how China started tens of millions of people. 

It does spend a lot more time on Western bastards though. The Paul Manafort one is gold."
13370,hsuop7,"Why not ""Wikipedia is #FakeNews, everyone knows that"" instead of mentioning sources and references as if you bothered to take a even a look at them since they don't fit your narrative.. Bias only happens to other people I guess."
13371,hsuop7,"Please research these camps. Millions of muslims are imprisoned their for no crime. They have organs harvested, sterilization and other horrific crimes. It is a genocide and has zero comparison with people here commiting crimes then going through due process to be jailed. Anyone who cant distinguish the difference lacks basic empathy"
13372,hsuop7,"Its not, but it overlaps since a lot of anti fascists are communists who sometimes are tankies.

Critical support for the good achievements comrade Stalin achieved though, aside from the negative components of his rule."
13373,hsuop7,Literally just had 2 people tell me the holodomor didnt happen in response to this
13374,hsuop7,I mean stalin was pretty damn good at anti-fascism
13375,hsuop7,"Good question, I came here thinking it was just an anti fascist sub, then people went off when I said extremism on either side should be condemned"
13376,hsuop7,It didn't the second highest comment on this is silence tankie
13377,hsuop7,"Good point, who wouldve thought being anti Hitler and anti stalin would be controversial some day. Strange world"
13378,hsuop7,"Thats def not why i got called out, i never said that before now. I got called out for being ""an enlightened centrist"" which is an insult tankies use for those that are at all right of full communism. Scroll down, theres people shitting on me calling social democrats ""enlightend centrists"". Go back and look at some of the previous posts in this sub if you don't believe what im saying about Stalin. People saying the kulaks deserved it etc, were greedy and didnt want to share their grain. Its absurd that to be against fascism youre somehow vilified if youre not a communist"
13379,hsuop7,100% regardless of your other politics everyone should be anti fascist
13380,hsuop7,I can drink to that
13381,hsuop7,"Fun fact: China literally stopped being an ally to the soviet union because Soviets stopped worshiping Stalin's dick.

""In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Sino-Soviet debates about the interpretation of orthodox Marxism became specific disputes about the USSR's policies of national de-Stalinization and international peaceful coexistence with the Western world, which Mao decried as Marxist revisionism."""

13386,hsuop7,"Well your questions are rhethorical and everyone knows the answer to them, so I think I would be unneccesary to answer them.

My point is that Stalin was a leninist (up to certain point in time) and thus a leftist. Do you think that Stalin was a leninist?"
13387,hsuop7,I've listened to it it's by Robert Evan's and while I like him he has shit takes on actually existing socialist states. You need to listen to [stalin a ml perspective ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0svcLa0VcgipDtVTIWCKmw?si=knHvR7TYQkeS_h7-L6GKXQ) it's extremely source heavy.
13388,hsuop7,Dillweed they literally have the black book of communism listed.
13389,hsuop7,Wikipedia is liberal af.
13390,hsuop7,"In China they use nonsensical laws and people's tendency to go ""well they broke the law so they are getting the punishment they deserve"" in order to collect people.

In America they do the EXACT same thing.  Why do you think the punishment for Marijuana usage is more severe than cocaine?  Or more severe than domestic violence for that matter?  Why are non-violent crimes treated harsher than pretty much anything else short of serial killers?

Because America wants non-violent non-dangerous inmates in order to fill their prisons.  Which people will defend with ""well they just broke the law."" Even though the law was made for the singular purpose of being able to arrest non-criminals.

You are right, they do harvest organs from prisoners in China. Do you know what America does with their prisoners?  Force them to do slave labor without pay.  Which is legal under the 13th Amendment.

At peak slavery numbers pre-civil war, there were 4 million slaves.  Now we have around 2 million. 
 Slavery never truly ended in the USA, we just started calling the people we wanted to enslave ""criminals"" and people proceeded to cheer on for them to be shackled.

And yes, mass slavery of a racial groups is a form of genocide under the Geneva Convention.

Also if you think due process means shit in the USA, you are just wearing a bag over your head.  Countless people are left in jail for months or years without seeing a court-date.  An extrodinarially large number of people are convicted on little more than their skin color.  And the state regularly engages in cruel and unusual torture like solitary confinement, which is one of the most severe forms of torture available, and greatly exceeds the mental damage that can be caused by any physical maiming.

If you can't see why this is just as bad as what China is doing, you lack basic empathy.

If your argument is ""they broke the law so they deserve it"" when the law is horseshit and designed for the sole purpose of being able to imprison innocent people, you lack basic empathy."
13391,hsuop7,Since when did you people start giving a shit about muslims?
13392,hsuop7,The holodomor did happen but stalin didn’t make it
13393,hsuop7,Didn't he ally with Hitler at first?
13394,hsuop7,"Idk, Stalin did pretty much everything a fascist would do other than go hypercapitalist and full-blown race war. He was a narcissistic strong-man dictator who cultivated a cult of personality and squashed the individual underneath the state. Literally two traits away from being a straight up fascist. 

Which is to say that he was an authoritarian, and authoritarianism is close enough to fascism proper that I would expect anyone billing themselves as ""anti fascist"" to be equally ""anti authoritarian"". This is why I can't take antifascist tankies seriously."
13395,hsuop7,"Except for the times he worked with nazis to split eastern Europe between the two. :)

Except for the time Stalin delayed any attack on the nazis. Except for the time he rather purged half of his army's officers rather than send them to the front to organise a battle against the nazis. Except for basically all the times he directly or indirectly cooperated with the nazis like supplying them with the goods they needed to continue their war efforts.

The women and men who fought the nazis at the front were good at antifascism. They sacrificed their lives. They killed nazis. Stalin was pretty bad at antifascism by hindering the success of his own army. Fuck anyone who still glorifies Stalin to this day. Especially anyone who calls themselves antifascist yet supports a supporter of fascism and genocide."
13396,hsuop7,"Haha thats true i guess, he was also good at genocide"
13397,hsuop7,"> then people went off when I said extremism on either side should be condemned

Because there isn't two sides. Your mistake is in assuming anyone left of you is a Marxist-Leninist when the fact is actually that (on this sub at least) most people to left of you will actually be anarchists who are just as (if not more) critical of Stalin than you are.

Take a look at the most common Anti-Fascist symbol, the red flag and the black flag. The red flag represents communism (in all its forms; including but not limited to both anarcho-communism and Marxism-Leninism) and the black flag represents anarchism. The reason for this is that anarcho-communists tend to be the most vocally opposed to facism.

If someone here criticizes you for saying ""both sides"" on this subreddit, that's not because they're supporting Stalin, it's because it's a bad argument that conflates all leftists as Stalinists. Not even all Marxists-Leninists support Stalin.

Some do, but it's also worth acknowledging (even if you are critical of Stalin) that the US perpetrated a long, protracted bout of anti-Stalin propoganda. He was certainly no saint and is worthy of criticism (quite a lot in my opinion) but he's also not the devil the US has portrayed him as, so I understand why some ML defend him."

That's probably why. There are non tankie socialists you know.

13408,hsuop7,"Yeah I suggested that as an intro I've been bingeing 20 plus hours of history a week for more than a decade now. And have just been rereading capital. Stalin's authoritarian state with its brutal police, rampant starvation, and severe and violent suppression of people are all totally out of line with the principles of Marxism. That's why I called it a fascist state, those are all hallmarks of fascism. Just as we're seeing basically the same things now in America."

13411,hsuop7,Beat case scenario collectivization was a massive failure that resulted in the starvation of at least 3million people. Worst case scenario Stalin intentionally starved 3 million ukrainians in response to them reaisting collectivization. Its pretty widely accepted that at the very least he intentionally exacerbated the famine to kill off Ukrainian farmers.
13412,hsuop7,"No, it was a non aggresion pact. He dus however propose an alliance with the western Powers to prevent Hitler, even wanting to send a lot of troops West but they refused so the USSR had no other options then to have a non aggresion pact with Germany."
13413,hsuop7,He held a non agression pact long enough so stalin could build up his army
13414,hsuop7,"He wasn't just ""authoritarian"". That is not a sufficient term. He was totalitarian. Totalitarianism is even more extreme than authoritarianism. It is pseudodemocratic, postdemocratic and antidemocratic. It pretends to be democratic, it says they're better than ""ordinary"" democracy and they reject democracy.

Just to be clear. The ""ordinary democracy"" part doesn't necessarily refer to a parliamental ""democracy"". It refers to what the totalitarian regime sees as other ""petty democracies"". It holds up their (pseudo)democratic system over actual democratic systems. This can include parliamental ""democracy"" but goes on over direct democracy and council democracy and many more."
13415,hsuop7,"Lol, are you really saying tankies are almost fascists"

13417,hsuop7,"If you're referring to the Holodomor then there's a lot of dispute over whether that counts as genocide. It was a tragedy, but it's debatable whether it was a deliberate famine."
13418,hsuop7,"Stalin is probably the most evil person in history, because of the mass genocide he perpetuated against his own people. So many Russians died for doing nothing wrong. Now they are left with all this land and a continuously decaying people. As things are going, we may see Russia disintegrate as the USSR did. And they can put a lot of that blame on Stalin (and Hitler too)."
13419,hsuop7,"Ok but anarcho communism is extremism, and has been a complete failure in every form. Its the left wing equivalent of libertarianism. I dont think anyone left of me is automtically a leninist, just like i dont think anyone right of me is automatically a fascist. Anarcho capitalism and anarcho communism both would be disasterous and arent realistic for large countries. Also anarcho communism has literally nothing to do with anti fascism. Everyone should be anti fascist. There needs to be a balance of government intervention and free markets to create a well functioning economy. There most certainly are two sides, take for example the USSR and Nazi Germany, should both not be condemned even though theyre on opposite sides?"
13420,hsuop7,"Of course thats why I said extremism on both sides, and not just both sides"

13427,hsuop7,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact

>	In addition to the publicly-announced stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included the Secret Protocol, which defined the borders of Soviet and German spheres of influence across Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland. The secret protocol also recognised the interest of Lithuania in the Vilno region, and Germany declared its complete disinterest in Bessarabia.

Not exactly just a non-aggression pact."
13428,hsuop7,"Oh ok, interesting. I haven't done a lot of research on it, to be honest. I'll have to do more."
13429,hsuop7,"I'd say that tankies, Stalinism, and Maoism are only communist insofar as they got their ideas from communism, but are all so far removed from what (I understand to be) communism's ideals that it's almost an insult to communists when they call themselves ""communists"". 

Communism and authoritarianism should not mix. The USSR is proof of this. It didn't work then, and the only reason it kinda worked for China is because China went back to liking capitalism just enough to still call themselves a communist party with a straight face. Which is to say, it _didn't_ work for China, either.

Authoritarianism itself, and totalitarianism in particular, are pretty much steps 1-8 of 10 of building a fascist society. So yeah, being authoritarian like Stalin, or supporting someone like Stalin, absolutely qualifies one to be ""almost"" fascist. It should also disqualify one from being communist, since every experiment to date in blending the two failed so spectacularly that most Westerners don't even know that communism wasn't ever supposed to be implemented that way."
13430,hsuop7,">Nobodys glorifying him

[I'm not surprised though that you have no clue about history.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Soviet_Commercial_Agreement_(1940)) You guys literally just rely on USSR state propaganda to tell you what's right and what's wrong."
13431,hsuop7,"No it isn't really debatable amongst all respected historians, ive seen footage of the red army shooting people for hiding food and burning down their farms. What youre doing is as bad as denying the holocaust. 3 million people were intentionally starved to death because Stalin was angry they refused collectivization. 

Now, for the sake of arguement lets say youre right. In that case attempted collectivization of farming was such a colossal failure it resulted in the death of 3-12 million people via starvation. But any unbiased historian will tell you the holodomor was very real and very intentional.

13444,hsuop7,"I'm not ignoring that it happened. And I'm not ignoring that it was a terrible tragedy. I'm also not absolving Stalin of responsibility. But there is often a lot of context missing in these discussions about the Holodomor.

Ukraine was already susceptible to famine.

The Kulaks were actually burning their own crop yields and slaughtering their own livestock in order to spite Soviet collectivization efforts, which absolutely exacerbated the issue.

Stalin most likely saw the famine as a convenient opportunity to get rid of a class that was already demonized by the USSR going on a decade by that point (but even then, there are historical archives of Stalin addressing the issue).

What we've seen time and time again is that rapid industrialization and forced collectivization efforts have resulted in a lot of unnecessary death. But that's different then a leader literally engineering a famine.

The closest thing I could compare it to today is Trump's response to COVID 19. He didn't introduce the virus to America, but he sure as hell isn't doing anything about it. Instead, he wants to reopen the economy. That's awful, but we need to be more specific in how we characterize it."

To clarify I'm not from the US and I am not anti-voting but I see this optimism around voting while you've got a fascist pres in power. I don't think voting is going to be enough is all."

There was a Democratic senator who casually admitted on twitter that they were planning a coup in Venezuela in 2019 but blamed Trump for it not working out. 

We already lost, bro

If voting didn’t matter, all of the neoliberals wouldn’t have coalesced at the same exact moment, while Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race hovering around FIFTH PLACE to drain progressive votes.

Voting and protesting is literally how we change things.  

Please don't listen to this person.  A resounding rejection of Trump and the GOP will help.  There is no one thing that fixes everything and anyone suggesting that's a thing is trying to manipulate you.  We won't be able to accomplish anything if we don't vote out Trump.

13558,i4ahqu,"Voting won't fix everything, but Trump is clearly worse than the status quo.

In a way The US is a broken leg that has slowly been healing but without much support. Trump was an asshole that broke the leg agian, opening up old wounds, getting him out will stop the leg from getting broken too much more but it doesn't heal the bone. If we want the bone to heal we need to protest, elect lawmakers that are on our side, and most importantly stop the next Republican nominee from getting elected at any cost (because they won't go back to a Mitt Romney, and there are Facists that have more cognitive control than Trump). 

If a cancer patient was told there was a drug that could stop them from getting worse, although it wouldn't cure it. I would expect them to be optimistic, all we have in the end is contol over our thoughts."

In France, the Communists ally with the Social-Democrats(1) against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.

In Switzerland, they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.”

13622,i4ahqu,"That’s a bs argument. Yes, COVID would have also killed people if we had a Democrat as a president. But it’s undeniable that Trump and his administration have totally botched the response to the pandemic, and that his actions (or lack thereof) have led to preventable deaths. 

Trump has: 

1. Put incompetent people in charge of making national policy decisions. 

February 26, 2020 – Even though Mike Pence had come under fire for health policy that worsened Indiana’s HIV outbreak during his time as the state’s governor, Trump appointed Pence to lead the United States’ response to the coronavirus outbreak. Pence has no medical background.

2. Systematically cut down on Medicare since the first days of his presidency, and wants to continue to do so if he wins a second term. 

January 20, 2017 – Within hours of his inauguration, Donald Trump took aim at the Affordable Care Act in his first executive order as president. Following up on his campaign’s recurring promise to dismantle Obamacare, the order weakened the program by allowing states to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay implementation of any provision or requirement” that would place a “fiscal burden” on the state. 

February 10, 2020 – Trump’s proposed fiscal year 2021 budget included significant cuts to foreign aid and Medicare. 

3. Downplayed the severity of the pandemic in the critical early stages, and promoted bunk science and quackery. 

February 24, 2020 – “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,” Trump tweeted as the virus spread at an alarming rate. “We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” Within a few days, the stock market suffered its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. 

March 4, 2020 – Despite dire warnings from the World Health Organization, Trump disputed the deadliness of Covid-19 on a “hunch.”

March 21, 2020 – Trump endorsed the combination of two drugs, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, to treat coronavirus—despite a lack of testing or backing by the FDA. In fact, respected medical professionals warned that taking the drugs together could be dangerous. 

April 5, 2020 – The U.S. stockpiled 29 million hydroxychloroquine pills, even though health experts doubted its efficacy and warned about its dangerous side effects. Trump pushed for hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. “What do I know?” he said at a news briefing. “I’m not a doctor. But I have common sense.” 

April 6, 2020 – Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro warned the White House as early as January that the coronavirus posed a great threat to the United States. Navarro said, “the lives of millions of Americans” could be imperiled by the pandemic. Trump continued to downplay the threat, saying a month later, “Now, this is just my hunch, and — but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild. They will get better very rapidly.”

May 18, 2020 – Trump confirmed that he was taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug he had long praised even though medical experts warned that it could be dangerous and was not shown to combat Covid-19. “I started taking it, because I think it’s good,” he said. “I’ve heard a lot of good stories.”

4. Tried to monopolize a potential cure 

March 15, 2020 – Officials from Germany’s Health Ministry said that Trump “offered large sums of money” to CureVac, a German company working on a coronavirus vaccine, in order to give the U.S. exclusive access to its information. U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell claimed that the story was wrong, but CureVac’s CEO confirmed the meeting with the White House. 

5. Has used the pandemic to push racist and xenophobic narratives 

March 18, 2020 – Trump announced that the U.S.-Mexico border would be sealed off to combat the spread of the coronavirus. But as NPR reported, there were roughly 100 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Mexico—far less than the 8,000 cases in the United States. The measure, though, allowed the administration to deport migrants without due process. 

March 18, 2020 – Even though the World Health Organization advised him not to, as his words could give rise to racial profiling, Trump defended his use of the term “Chinese virus” to refer to COVID-19.

April 21, 2020 – Congress approved $6 billion to help college students affected by the pandemic pay for food, childcare and housing. The Trump administration worked in a restriction to prevent undocumented students from getting any of the aid. 

April 30, 2020 – Trump administration officials put pressure on U.S. spy agencies to dig up evidence that the coronavirus originated in a lab in Wuhan, China — a theory that was widely discredited. The strategy was part of Trump’s attempt to blame China for what he continued to call the “Chinese virus.” 

6. Is making every effort to consolidate his own power by limiting states’ access to medical supplies and removing government oversight, and suppressing important information that makes him look bad 

April 2, 2020 – Jared Kushner, a White House adviser and Trump’s son-in-law, asserted that the Strategic National Stockpile of ventilators and medical supplies was “supposed to be our stockpile — it’s not supposed to be states’ stockpiles that they then use.” Journalists at the Kushner news conference pointed out that what he said went against the program’s description on its website. The following day, the program website’s wording was altered to match what Kushner had said. 

April 7, 2020 – Trump ousted the chairman of a watchdog panel that oversaw how the Trump administration managed $2 trillion in coronavirus relief. Glenn Fine, the acting Pentagon inspector general, was chosen in March to head the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Fine was the second inspector general in a week to be fired by the president, after the April 3 firing of whistle-blower Michael Atkinson.

May 4, 2020 – The White House issued new guidance that banned members of its pandemic task force from testifying before Congress. The decision was made shortly after infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose views often diverged from Trump’s, was prohibited from testifying before a House committee. 

May 5, 2020 – Rick Bright, the scientist who lost his job as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. In the complaint, Bright said his warnings about the coronavirus were dismissed by the Trump administration and that he was punished by being moved to another post.

May 6, 2020 – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put together a 17-page report advising Americans on when they could reopen the economy. According to a CDC official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the Trump administration prevented the release of the report, telling the CDC that it “would never see the light of day.”

May 15, 2020 – The coronavirus stabilization law that Congress passed included money for public education institutions hurt by the pandemic, but Trump’s Education Secretary Betsy DeVos directed $180 million of it to private and religious schools.

May 16, 2020 – Trump fired State Department Inspector General Steve Linick. Appointed by President Obama, Linick was another government watchdog ousted late on a Friday night. He was replaced by an ambassador who is close to Mike Pence. 

7. General Incompetence

 April 15, 2020 – As a result of waiting for months to obtain N95 respirator masks, the Trump administration paid companies $5 per mask — almost eight times what the price was earlier in the year.

April 27, 2020 – Trump ignored at least a dozen classified briefings in January and February which called the coronavirus an imminent threat. Officials said, on the condition of anonymity, that Trump seldom reads or listens to an oral summary of the President’s Daily Brief.

May 29, 2020 – Trump said he would end the country’s relationship with the World Health Organization. He had warned of the action since the early days of the pandemic. “Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,” he said.

June 10, 2020 – Trump said he would hold a campaign rally, the first such event in three months, even though coronavirus cases were rising in many states. 

But yeah, sure, Trump’s not worse than anyone else even though he ticks off a good 10/14 of Umberto Eco’s defining characteristics for fascist ideology."
13623,i4ahqu,"It was rona that made him drop out. He knew his grassroots movement would get thousands killed if it continued. I knocked on hundreds of doors before he lost Minnesota, and that was where I felt I made the most impact. Dude in dirty painters whites, still a dust ball from sanding drywall for 8 hours telling folks the working man has a candidate.  

He dropped and started spending his campaign money on rona relief. He isn't flexing that because of the wind not shifting hard enough.

I voted Nader for his run, and the center blamed me for bush 2. Rather than our far from perfect system.  Biden is far from a savior, but he isn't gonna start ww3 on Twitter. It's all about control of the house and Senate if we are going to get american versions of progressives in charge."
13624,i4ahqu,[removed]
13625,i4ahqu,"It's true though. Joe Biden's against M4A, legalizing marijuana, and pretty much against a majority of the stuff progressives are for. If you think Joe Biden's going to be in any way a net positive for progressives, I'm sorry, but you've got another thing coming.

Sure, voting blue with state elections *might* change things, but when so many choices are moderate (aka light Republican) Democrats or full-on Neo-Nazi Republicans, it's hard to feel encouraged that any real positive change will happen if those keep on being our only two choices. Sure, more and more progressives are joining the candidacy, but at the pace they are going, it might be too late. Especially since we are one of the richest and most powerful countries in the world, meaning we should be in the forefront of environmental politicies. But, even if we vote Biden, with him and both parties hatred of the Green New Deal, something [a lot of climate scientists endorse,](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/01/29/57-climate-scientists-object-after-biden-falsely-claims-not-single-solitary) it's hard to see what voting blue will accomplish.

Don't get me wrong, voting Trump is a terrible idea as well. And since both choices are terrible, what really is the point of voting?

By the way, even Biden's against police reform, so that's another thing that doesn't really accomplish anything: peaceful protesting. Sure, it accomplishes *some*, but never enough."

I don't know if you need to hear this, but, America is not some fucking fairytale like it's depicted in America. It runs on slavery (both penal and wage) and it doesn't change because you voted option B instead of option A.

* Poor people of any color, but especially marginalized peoples

* Average americans of average income in average cities. 

* The ruling class, who absolutely will continue to get richer and continue exploiting the shit out of you.

Voter suppression is one of the biggest reasons we ended up here.  The fact that Americans just don't vote means that so many of us have not been counted for so long.  Not being counted is why we are in this situation.

My only question really is why do you think Guido is the real president of Venezuela? The UN and Jimmy Carter Foundation consider Venezuela elections some of the best in the world or at least they did back in Chavez' day - like I said I don't know much about Maduro's administration.

Agreed. In a way I worry that this is simply the price you have to pay if you want to build a strong united front in the west that can protect us from fascism. But it is really scary how willingly people here believe that the Chinese of the PRC, oppressed and exploited for centuries - liberated from slavery, monarchy, nationalism, and Japanese fascism, have build a fascist terror state. Isn't the much more plausible view that a pampered colony that used schoolbooks from GB and is culturally dominated by the US harbors a lot of citizens that would be good tools for the west to build PR against the PRC?

13911,i8egle,"Tbf, isn't the regular swastika also the coward's swastika?"
13912,i8egle,"Pretty much. If I were a criminal id plaster everything with ""I love cops"" and ""far right ho-ah!"" Stickers and flags."
13913,i8egle,"I think the correlation between the Confederate flag being taken down everywhere and the sudden explosion of this... thing... Is not a coincidence.

I think it's perfect. Here is a flag for the Americans that want to live in a fascist police state. They love low rent police behavior so much they put it on their national banner.

Next, they'll start using the theme song from *Cops* as their new national anthem."
13914,i8egle,The irony of putting away a Confederate flag to fly a modified modern flag of the Union is... ironic.
13915,i8egle,"It's especially frustrating because I do actually know people who aren't racist but have bought heavily into the southern pride thing.

Doesn't help that southern education to this day refuses to properly address what the civil war was about. I graduated high-school only a few years ago and they were still hemming-hawing about why it happened, and my dad was taught that it was fought over taxes."
13916,i8egle,That gets me good everytime I see the crazies with all the American flag branded shit. It goes directly against the flag code they care so0o0 deeply about
13917,i8egle,"50 years ago people would have been livid at this flag because it'd have been considered a disrespectful re-coloring / re-purposing of the national banner. There used to be pretty strict laws for use of the flag in advertising too, I don't know if there still are."
13918,i8egle,Wut. How is it anti america. Amerikkka is founded on white supremacy and imperialism
13919,i8egle,"Curious, what are the beliefs you assume them to have?"

13922,i8egle,wooosh?
13923,i8egle,"It's same reasoning with the swastika. 

It was basically a symbol of lifeforce, life, energy, the sun, etc. And now it shows you're a fascist.

And the flag may once have been about guarding, protecting and standing first... but now it means you're a fascist."
13924,i8egle,"People are using Nazi as a shorthand for Fascist because at some level, the distinction really doesn't matter, especially when they are supporting a system that systematically targets and brutalizes specific minorities, up to and including having secret police kidnap people, and actual concentration camps where they hold actual children.

Yes they aren't actually gassing people and throwing them in ovens yet.  But it took the ACTUAL Nazi party in Germany 20 years to get to that point, and 8 years for Hitler to get to that point, and 4 years into Trump's presidency he's almost perfectly synced up with where Hitler was 4 years into being chancellor and eventually the Führer.

I don't think we have to wait until they begin committing another Holocaust to call them what they are: Wannabe Nazis who would prefer if genocide wasn't such a dirty negative word; they prefer ""ethnic cleansing,"" much more polite and not nearly so politically charged /sarcasm."
13925,i8egle,If you want to be explicit: I believe anyone that spends money on and then then flies this specific flag is acting like an authoritarian nationalist.
13926,i8egle,"Do you really think that cops who refuse to out the assholes in their system are good?

They are complacent, and complicit.

If they refuse to police themselves, they should be torn down and started over again, and anyone who was an LEO in the past should be automatically refused a position, due to their willingness to be complicit with bigots and murderers."
13927,i8egle,Apparently lol. Because liking law and order is equivalent to supporting the killing of Jews. Makes sense

The whole South changed, both due to the ravaged of war but also the from the release of their biggest source of labor and from Reconstruction policies, and their all like ""Yeah, but I think taxes was the important part."""
13938,i8egle,"There are several studies showing that people will often defend things when they feel they are being attacked, even when they don't strongly support the issue/cause. There is an aspect of human nature, an evolutionary impulse, to help defend the tribe when under attack. I believe this impulse has often driven populations, like poor whites in the South, to join in conflicts that very often don't align with their interests.

Poor whites in the South were not slave owners and were economically hurt by slavery due to the stunting of the economy. They had very little reason to fight in the war but were the ones that paid the highest price in the course of being slaughtered. WWI was another perfect example of this."

13945,i8egle,"Don't forget that the word ""Nazi"" has always been used as an insult for fascists. It's amazing that people think it means a specific fascist party from Germany when members of that party would have literally killed you for calling them that."

13948,i8egle,"Unmmm fascism isn’t just the genocide of a people. Sending in unconstitutional federal troops and tear gassing/pepper spraying moms and the mayor of a city is fascism. 
If you don’t think the people who wear/fly that unamerican flag don’t support fascist ideology, you’re wrong. Nazi’s were also “just following orders”."
13949,i8egle,"The Nazi party were authoritarian nationalists long before they tried their hand at genocide.

Back then all the universities and international media called them out on it too and as you'd expect the local ""true Germans"" said they were out of touch elite traitors."
13950,i8egle,"""Just following orders.""

Those who choose to follow orders that act in the name of fascism are not innocent."
13951,i8egle,"If you think ""killing Jews"" is a problem, and ""killing POC"" isn't, and that it would only be an issue if Jews were being targeted...  Well, you're still a Nazi, you just have a different target.

State sponsored execution of a specific racial group is state sponsored execution of a specific racial group.  The group targeted is irrelevant.

And if you say ""Police are just enforcing the law."" Have you considered that German police were doing the exact same thing?  Did you realize that the Holocaust was legal in Germany?

Here's a little surprising concept you might not have realized.  Some laws can be bad.  Some laws can be designed to hurt innocent people.  Supporting bad laws that hurt innocent people makes you a bad person."

13961,i8egle,"Worse part? It wasn't even as long ago as you might be picturing. My dad graduated in '89.

I was taught that slavery was obviously a factor but so was a lot of other things.

But if you read the articles of sucession, they'll all about slavery"
13962,i8egle,"The largest motivation on the part of the South was the preservation of power, status and wealth on the part of the elites. The idea of the loss of slavery and the potential restructuring of the economy was the overarching concern, all other arguments can basically be rolled up under this motivation. The ironic thing that we can clearly see in hindsight, and was readily viewable then, is the liberalization of the economy, the elimination of slavery and the advent of an open market is a far more efficient creator of wealth than slavery. The North, through the machinations of the free market, competition, and the employment of capital was far wealthier and had vast more economic resources than the South which should have given pause to those considering civil war.

Another terrible, and heartbreaking reality, is that these wars are fought by the poor and uneducated who are always so easily swayed by the sentiments of nationalism and false crisis. I say are, not were, as I don't believe we have seen the last of these wars and the slaughter of the poor in their futile execution."

13964,i8egle,"You're welcome, I feel to many on reddit jump to hostility when you ask a question or disagree in anyway. Dialogue is necessary to understanding people.

 I do agree there are bad cops out there and we need reform so they are fired and can't work as officers again anywhere but I don't agree that it's as prolific as it's displayed in the media. I've had a number of run in's with cops and I've had two unpleasant ones being traffic scenarios and other than the traffic cops they have all been nice and want everyone to be safe. One of the times I was expecting me or a few others in my group to go to jail and they let us go with a slap on the wrist. A friend of mine currently in Portland advocating the abolishment of police has been slapped on the wrist so many times in our area due to driving while high on weed so I don't understand how people attribute the actions of shitty people to all of a demographic. To each their own I guess."
13965,i8egle,"George Floyd wasn't killed because he was black, he was killed because of a shitty officer being bad at his job. Many of the majorly publicised incidents are usually just shit people that became cops that suck at their job and should have been fired long before the incidents they have. it wasn't ""I'ma kill a black guy today"" especially in Floyds situation since they were accommodating for the longest time until he wanted to be put on the ground. Same with Bryonna Taylor, horrible incident and I think the officer that messed up the address should be charged for what happened but it's not like they killed her due to her race, they never saw her and the cops did a shit job.

I also think the initial response after the incident was wrong in regards to her bf being jailed and the run around/cover up they attempted. Everyone involved should have proper repercussions as well."

The checks and balance system works, it’s just not as knee jerk as the twitterverse would like. There are a long list of trump administrative agency decisions struck down by local courts.

14008,i8egle,"Bad apples spoil the bunch. The justice system is corrupt, see systemic racism, so by participating you are a piece of that. For example any cop knows that the white man the arrest for a blunt is going to get a fine, but the black man they arrest is likely to do time. That's assuming they even detain the white guy to begin with. Or that they don't make assumptions about the black guy that result in escalation or more charges.

So sure, they are not all Nazis, but they are all part of the problem as they are the arm of an unjust system. Not every German was a die hard Nazi looking to exterminate undesirables. But most of them went along with the laws and participated (joined the military, supported the war effort etc).

As to your last point I would say they are unequal generalizations as, like I said above, cops are able to ruin lives and commit violence without repercussions. Protesters for the most part are not. The power dynamics are unequal. And that's not even getting into the nitty gritty in differences. Like say, protesters often targetting large chains/conglomerates vs police often committing acts against the poor and marginalized."

The Israeli Nation-State is extremely racist and religious, gays, christians, muslims and atheists have to go to Cyprus to get married, The law literally says that Israel is a jewish state for the jewish people only.

However, most people actually support peace and democracy in Israel, public admiration for Yitzhack Rabin (after his bone-breaking times) is much higher than for Bibi. It's just the extreme hegemony that the Israeli nation-state imposed on the Israeli people makes them seriously doubt their own politics, because Bibi has practically been in power since the 90s.

Not all, but some."
14167,gokzmo,"As a Jew myself (an atheist Jew, to be fair, but still a Jew, *and* one who's read the Bible and the commentaries), I have often wondered this. It always blew my mind because Leftist thought (from Socialism all the way to Anarcho-Communism) is *steeped* in Jewish history, to the point where I've heard super-religious Orthodox rabbis argue that the Torah is the origin of Socialism and that fighting for Socialism (for everyone, not just for Jews) is a core part of being the Chosen People.

And yet... Israelis...

I actually heard it described once as Collective Inherited PTSD. We are one of the most persecuted people in history (note: I said *one of*, not *the*... that distinction needs to be made because I'm not dismissing others who have been persecuted, many worse than us... but also, persecution is not an Olympic sport... there aren't ""levels"" or ""winning""; there are only intersections), and especially after the Holocaust, we definitely operate, as a people, with a collective fear of the rest of the world.

After Charlottesville, when White Nationalists were marching in the streets shouting ""Jews will not replace us"", it was very hard not to think ""how can anyone still wonder why we Jews want a place away from the rest of the world to live in peace free from this shit?""

The problem, of course, is that nationalist thinking is not limited to White Christians. There's a reason some White Nationalists in the US have actually praised Netanyahu and his government, because what they're building in Israel, and what they've been building since the Balfour Declaration, is an Ethnostate. And they are exploiting the collective, Inherited PTSD of the Jewish people in order to justify it. 

I do personally think that that's a complete betrayal of Judaism and Jewish values, but it is what's going on."

14169,gokzmo,"My friend used to put it like this, ""A lot of us came out of the Holocaust and said never again, but a bunch of people came out and said never again, to us."" Pretty much that a trauma on the scale of the Holocaust can very much be the catalyst for a ""It's either us or them"" mentality, which makes for a really fucked world view."
14170,gokzmo,"As someone currently on the Israeli school system, there is no mention of oppressing Palestinians, the nationalism of israel or the atrocities committed today. 1948 was the independence war, not the nakba. Zionism is justified because of Jewish prosecution, but there is complete ignorance of Zionist colonialism. It is a borderline-facsist ethnostate, which passively denies and normalizes oppression similar to the oppression the jewish people experienced in the holocaust."

14173,gokzmo,"As a Jew, the cynical side of me has always suspected that all religion breeds far-right authoritarianism and bigotry, and that the only reason we don’t have a history of violence, authoritarianism, persecution, and terrorism like all the other major religions is that we’ve pretty much never had a land of our own, always being guests—usually unwanted guests—in Christian or Muslim nations. The government of Israel continues to prove me right every day."
14174,gokzmo,"The argument on the right of Israel is the rest of the world hates Jews, and wants them all dead, as evidenced by a thousand years or so of virulent antisemitism and genocide.

The only way to survive is to have a land of their people and only their people, anyone else is a threat."
14175,gokzmo,"I’m not sure how well you can apply psychology to cultures, but it makes a lot of sense if you think of it as a cultural-scale trauma reaction."
14176,gokzmo,"I was raised Jewish, the son of a Holocaust survivor, and went to Hebrew school taught mostly by Sabras (people born in Israel) who moved to the U.S..  I remember being told by them that Arabs and Muslims were essentially savages, and that Palestine was civilized by the European Jewish immigrants.  In the wake of the news of the terrorist attacks in the late 70’s and early 80’s, I believed it.  It wasn’t until I went to college and met Arabs and Muslims and realized they were people just like me.  But I think of all the other kids that I grew up with who were taught to hate."
14177,gokzmo,"Nazis were bad, they're not nazi, they're the chosen ones so they can't be bad!

Also if my hsitory teacher who orgasnised exchanges between our nations is to be trusted, there's a lot of actual ""we're the chosen people"" propaganda going on.

And if anything can be is similar between our nations (Poles and Jews) it's that we were both targeted for extermination (Poles were just slightly better in this subhuman hierarchy) yet our both nations can do waht fascism did and stil think that we're not like those German fascists because our ancestors were victims. IT's kinda sad how our both nations are basically becomin fascistic right now.

This is a gross oversimplification but the gist of it is that many of those people have been influenced by propaganda and don't see they're exactly on the way to become nazis, just not commiting industrial genocide yet."

Israel is an extremely divided country. There's 3 major groups within Israel:

2. Seculars (more western, liberal usually.)

3. Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. 

The 3 groups are incredibly divided and out of touch with each other, theres barely any mixed neighborhoods, and when there are it's pretty much limited to Seculars and Arabs, funnily enough those 2 groups are often more aligned with each other than Seculars and Religious people.

14194,gokzmo,This isn't the overwhelming sentiment in Israel. This guy is the equivalent of a white supremacist from America. You can't judge an entire country based on what a few of them say.
14195,gokzmo,I think it's to do with the richer areas being in the North and that's where people tend to be lighter skinned plus influence from fucked up western standards of beauty but I could be wrong.
14196,gokzmo,"It's not just a Hindu thing.  Colorism is big in most of India.  There's a reason why most Bollywood stars are fairly light skinned North Indians.


India's bigger issue is Hindu nationalism though.  They aren't trying to deport all of the dark skinned Indians, but they are trying to deport the Indian Muslims."
14197,gokzmo,"Sure, but there aren't a lot of countries that enshrined in law that ""this is a country for a certain ethnicity and the rest can fuck off"" like Israel did:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People"
14198,gokzmo,"You know the reason. 

Hint: they aren't white."
14199,gokzmo,"Israel has passed legislation saying that, too:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People"
14200,gokzmo,The creation of Isreal as it has been done is one of the many problematic drawing of borders we have inherited from the colonial times.
14201,gokzmo,/u/userleansbot
14202,gokzmo,Make that statement on the German supposedly left-wing subreddits r/Dachschaden or r/deistlinks and you get permabanned like myself. Their mods are part of the Antideutsche movement.
14203,gokzmo,"""Israel is fascist"" is as accurate as ""the USA are imperialistic"" or ""Germany in 1935 was Nazi"". Sure, you can't generalize that for every single individual person, but you can say the majority and the government are those things.

I say that as a Brazilian. I'm not a fascist. But my country is."
14204,gokzmo,He is an outlier
14205,gokzmo,[deleted]
14206,gokzmo,Do you mean Hasidic?
14207,gokzmo,"Cool story bro.  Who should we fuck more, the Satmar or Belz?"
14208,gokzmo,This guy isnt orthodox
14209,gokzmo,I don't know why you're implying that we can't criticize the violent actions by the Israeli government while also criticizing other human rights abuses around the world.  Being against Israel doesn't make you pro Iran.
14210,gokzmo,Yes but have you considered Israel bad?
14211,gokzmo,This is the prevailing opinion among Israeli society. You can watch Abby Martin walk around interviewing random people in Israel and it's the same thing you see here. I've been there and this is how Israelis talk about Arabs. I noticed it as soon as I arrived. Israeli kids make hissing sounds at Arabs.
14212,gokzmo,"You can ask their laws:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People"
14213,gokzmo,"Israel has [ethnonationalist principles](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44881554) embedded into its form of a constitution. (Even though they don't have a direct constitution.) The Likud party in general is in favor of ethno-nationalism and annexation of occupied territories and pushing for the settler-colonialism.

It's not the same, as citing an islamist to prove that islam is a terrorist religion. I admit though, that both islamists and the Likud party are the right-wing of their respective groups, but Likud is liked enough among the Israeli population, that they are the governing party. If anything, one could compare it with the AKP in Turkey, while the equivalent of an islamist terrorist would probably be someone like Baruch Goldstein."
14214,gokzmo,[deleted]
14215,gokzmo,"Yes, a state having troubling ideas means that every single person in it should die in nuclear explosions.

This is a reasonable opinion."
14216,gokzmo,Fuck off fash
14217,gokzmo,[deleted]
14218,gokzmo,"Absolutely. We must show solidarity to our Jewish brothers and sisters who have historically been the victims of so much bigotry and racism.

We must also be opposed to settler-colonialism and ethnostates, no matter what guise they appear under."
14219,gokzmo,100% agreement here.
14220,gokzmo,"Or simpler. 
""Should you be oppressed for being Jewish? Of course not!""
""Should you be oppressed for not being jewish? Of course not!"""
14221,gokzmo,"There is this Finnish Rabbi who said that it is not anti antisemitism criticizing Israel. 

&#x200B;

I am sorry but i can't remember his name for the life of me."
14222,gokzmo,"I think some people struggle because they define ""Zionism"" differently, that is more like patriotism in America, and assumes everyone else shares that definition.

Republicans love to accuse social justice advocates (esp. persons of color) of being unpatriotic when they speak out. AOC and Ilhan Omar are absolutely patriots. Accusing Colin Kapernik of being ""anti-American"" was a very effective way to shut down the conversation he wad trying to have about institutionalized racism in America.

Being ""pro-america"" doesn't mean you're ok with the systemic oppression here. And there are a whole lot of Republicans who would be happy to see the constitution burn and replaced with religious doctrine or KKK policies. I figure"
14223,gokzmo,"I think you're generally right. But I think the deeper problem is that we don't all agree on what constitutes a shitty chapter, and we have no mechanism by which to reach agreement."
14224,gokzmo,"It’s hating on people (who happen to be Jewish) for being assholes. Not hating on them simply for being Jewish.

Big and extremely obvious difference."
14225,gokzmo,"No, it isn't."
14226,gokzmo,You kid but that is an actual thing
14227,gokzmo,Ladder kickers.. I like it.
14228,gokzmo,[Always a Bigger Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agzNANfNlTs) is worth a watch if you want to understand their thinking
14229,gokzmo,The anti-feminist and sexist checks out for a gay man many of them take their non-sexual attraction of women to new misogynistic levels.
14230,gokzmo,Isn’t that second quote Alan Dershowitz’s entire value system?
14231,gokzmo,"thank you so much for your response.

it really cleared up a lot of confusion i had with the whole situation. i just feel like the situation overall is so complicated it's almost impossible to have a discussion about it."
14232,gokzmo,Often times religious people are.
14233,gokzmo,past ~~couple decades~~ 70+ years
14234,gokzmo,"It's always spun me out how pro-colonisation Americans tend to be. If you said this kind of thing in Australia (moderate to left Aus, anyway) you'd be side-eyed out of the room - and most white Aussies are descended from people who really didn't want to be here and were forcibly brought. Maybe it's whole ""authority is bad, fuck the Man"" mentality, but even some right-wing Aussies will agree that the colonisation was dodgy. There's no ""we freed ourselves and made a home!"" narrative."
14235,gokzmo,"Fuck off, Nazi."
14236,gokzmo,[deleted]

14245,gokzmo,"I'm not judging all Israelis by this guy, that there are nice or well meaning Israelis doesn't change that Israel is an illegitimate settler colonial state."
14246,gokzmo,I get so wrapped up in American politics and racist issues and immigration and all that that I forget how openly shitty 98% of the rest of the world is
14247,gokzmo,"That’s a great bit of criticism. It’s not based on the words of an individual, and it’s impossible to refute.

We all know that criticising Israel is not anti-Semitic. But the criticism has to be intelligent and considerate of outside opinions and general ignorance."
14248,gokzmo,"The English who promised the land to so many groups (the Palestinians for independence, sharif Mecca for a unified Arab state, the Zionists for a ""Jewish state"") had no intention to deliver any of their promises. However, the ""Arab states"" (a new wave of nationalism started after the independence movement taking advantage of the weak state of England and France post WWII) saw the Jewish refugees from Europe as a new form of western colonialism and decided to side with the Soviets for military support, which gave the Zionists the chance to pitch themselves as the only possible allies to the US in the region (the begging of a proxy war between the easy and the west).
.
The Zionists saw a Jewish state is a way to escape future prosecution (not to be a minority anymore that can easily be discriminated against). Except the land they had chosen already had people living on it. Now that 80 years has passed what is a logical solution? I think the best way to go is to divide the land into small city states where Jews remain a majority in some and other groups in others. And just work your way from there."

14250,gokzmo,"Of course, i agree, you can 100% critique all settler/colonialist “countries” as fascist and genocidal, and all nationalism as inherently violent towards indigenous populations or whatever “other” exists to be nationalistic towards in contrast.  Brazil is a settler nation that continues to commit genocide towards it’s remaining first nations population, it should be condemned and derided in the same breath.  YOU, a “thou” should be allowed to not be located as a continuance of the nationalistic ideology.  

Just like “Jews”, writ large, and Israelis of all colour and belief should be allowed to locate outside the nationalist paradigm and critique it.  This is exactly why its never easy to critique Israel without navigating the language carefully, as the pre-existence of global anti-jewishness is an undeniable fact.  Thus we have to parse our text carefully and self examine while critiquing."
14251,gokzmo,"No, he isn't. Israel has recently passed a law making clear that it's a country for Jews:

Netanyahu is a fucking fascist and was first chosen first minister in 1996 (one year after Rabin, the guy he called the death of, was actually assassinated). Taking land from Arabs through illegal settlements has been the Israeli government norm since then. And Israel literally shoots unarmed Palestine who ""get too near"" the border fence. 

Israel is a fascist and Jewish supremacist state."

That Arabs don't deserve equal rights? Could you cite that, please, vis-a-vis Rule 4?

I've been there, too. The overwhelming number of Jews I met did not talk about Arabs this way, and the overwhelming majority of Arabs I met there (and including Palestinians in the diaspora) do not talk about the Jews this way. Sounds a bit like you're characterizing an entire group with a stereotype and using personal anecdote as your only support. But that citation might help.  
  
>Israeli kids make hissing sounds at Arabs.  
  
Yeah, I saw Israeli anti-Arab sentiment, especially at venues like sporting events. Saw the opposite as well. Saw some Haredi children throw stones at Jewish women for walking by their community with tank tops on. But I never saw anyone *hissing* at anyone else. They'd be hissing all the damn time. Pretty demonic image, though, isn't it?"

 ___"
14261,gokzmo,"Nice try, bitch"
14262,gokzmo,LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK
14263,gokzmo,"Fun shit, I just got banned from the German ""left-wing"" subreddit r/Dachschaden, because I criticized the Antideutsche (anti-German movement) for blindly supporting the US and Israel and calling anyone antisemite who criticizes Israel for their violations of human rights or international law. (And I also got banned from r/deistlinks, whose mods seem to be in contact with those of the former sub, because I criticized that all anti-hygiene-demonstration participants were generalized as ""Nazis"".)

Unfortunetaly these Anti-Germans, despite being disliked by a lot of parts of the left in Germany, seem to be the dominant force of the German left on Reddit. (Atleast all the moderators of the aforementioned subs seem to be part of that group.)

So don't think, that Antifa is free of authoritarian behaviour and opinion policing or that all antifascists automatically share your view and adhere to logical consistency."
14264,gokzmo,For real
14265,gokzmo,"Shit, if you can get it to work man, let’s jump on it, but something tells me even this isn’t going to land.

Best of luck, I’ll be trying my damnedest."
14266,gokzmo,"Many extremely orthodox Jews are against Zionism. I don't recall the exact details, something about Jews being unable(or not allowed) to self-govern until the end times."
14267,gokzmo,Elaborate
14268,gokzmo,What is homofascism?
14269,gokzmo,"I watched ""How to Radicalize Normie"" the other day. It was great!"
14270,gokzmo,I will always upvote Innuendo Studios
14271,gokzmo,"Thx for that link :DD, I didn't know that channel and although we have some french channels dissecting the typical bad faith with which conspirationnists will construct their comments I didn't find that content in French and his channel is fucking great after a few vids"
14272,gokzmo,"That's just it. I'm not a both-sider at all usually, but the way people who are vehemently pro-Palestinian/anti-Zionist and people who are Zionist/anti-Palestinian insist on making it a black/white, one-easy-answer narrative infuriates me.

To be honest, I find it incredibly difficult to discuss in any situation.

Part of it is that I'm not a Zionist... at all. I actually agree that the way Israel treats Palestinians (some of whom are actually Jewish; a fact often glossed over even by people who are pro-Palestine) is apartheid, or at the very least shares enough in common with the definition of apartheid to be questionable at best. So of course I have trouble discussing the issue with Zionists.

The thing is, I also have trouble talking to anti-Zionists, as well, because at least the ones I've tried to talk to absolutely refuse to take the history of the Jews into account... the thousands of years of prosecution, the only-barely-not-successful attempt at complete genocide, etc, that leads to the very collective, inherited cultural PTSD that I'm talking about.

But there's another aspect to it that almost no one will entertain, and that's religion. I am absolutely convinced that so much of this conflict wouldn't exist if that specific plot of land in the Middle East wasn't claimed to be the ""Holy Land"" by ancient texts. I'm not saying that the Captalistic drive for oil isn't driving a lot of it, but it's so obvious to me that the fervor over the land is driven in part by religion, to the point where I genuinely believe that one step in making the situation *slightly* easier to solve would be... you know... the disappearance of religion and the worship of these ancient (and frankly not very well written) tomes that we call Holy Books.

It confuses me how so many people can downplay the role religion plays in this conflict over *The Holy Land*.

It's not the *only* reason, but it is one I wish more people talked about more often..."
14273,gokzmo,"More often than not, yeah. I've seen exceptions."
14274,gokzmo,"I think it is the opposite- right wing ideology is all about treating other people like shit. I think subconsciously they feel guilty about it, and end up turning to religion so assuage their guilt. I think if your political and personal ideology is to treat people with decency and dignity, you don’t have to have a vengeful man in the sky tell you you’re okay after you donate money."
14275,gokzmo,Not really. At the first half of Israel's existence we were Socialists. That changed in the 70s when we started becoming aligned with the US.
14276,gokzmo,"
>All zionists are Jews


Wouldn't the fundamentalist Christian right also be Zionist? Hell, even fascists seem to support Israel. I've heard it's because they want to nuke it, or at the very least shove all the world's Jews there, but still"
14277,gokzmo,"> All zionists are Jews

You clearly don't know any Mormons or other Christian denominations that can't have their prophecies come true without Israel."
14278,gokzmo,The dude himself said “the nation of the Jews” to mean Israel
14279,gokzmo,[deleted]
14280,gokzmo,"SOROS? ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY SOROS!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AntifascistsofReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
14281,gokzmo,"The US has never been targeted for racial extermination, whereas the Jews have. I feel like given the Jew's history of constantly being persecuted and hunted due to their race, they have the right to protect their people."
14282,gokzmo,"Well look at America. Our country is governed by an (arguably) racist lunatic, however the majority of the country doesn't reciprocate that sentiment."
14283,gokzmo,"In India they still lynch people in groups. Dalits (formerly known as Untouchables) have been murdered for:

* Owing $0,20.
* Riding a horse.
* Arguing.
* Eating at a wedding.
* Wearing certain clothes.
* Having mustaches.

Basically anyone who isn't a caste Hindu has been assaulted at some point. Indira Gandhi stormed the Sikh equivalent of Mecca. During an emergency declared by her, Sanjay Gandgi (her son) forcibly sterilized *over 8 million people*. They especially targeted people from Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Dalits and ethnic minorites), and Muslims."
14284,gokzmo,"> We all know that criticising Israel is not anti-Semitic.

Lots of people who aren't interested in honest discourse will argue until they're blue in the face that it is. They're wrong, but they don't care, this is a tribal issue for them."
14285,gokzmo,"I wouldn't hold internet criticism to that standard. Even if the subtitles are completely fake, that narrative still matches Israel's government's. And I think most people here know the context to reach that conclusion."
14286,gokzmo,"People who conflate all hasidim rarely realize that there are many dynasties.  Some are zionist, some are not.  One of the largest, based in Brooklyn, is the Hungarian Satmar dynasty, who are firmly agains Israel, and happily diasporic.
Its kind of important to know the particulars of what and whom you are critiquing before offering it."
14287,gokzmo,This guy is 100% religious zionist not orthodox.
14288,gokzmo,You didnt mean to.... but you are.
14289,gokzmo,It’s almost as if nationalities aren’t monolithic or something.
14290,gokzmo,"Why are you defending the ethnostate of Israel at all? It doesn’t matter if it’s the prevailing opinion, it’s literally founded on the oppression and murder of Palestinians?"
14291,gokzmo,"Rabin was an Israeli first minister who tried to reach peace with Palestine.

>In July 1995, Netanyahu led a mock funeral procession featuring a coffin and hangman's noose at an anti-Rabin rally where protesters chanted, ""Death to Rabin"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Yitzhak_Rabin#Background

In November 95, Rabin was assassinated by a Israeli fascist. 

In 96, Netanyahu was chosen as the first minister. 

Israel is a fascist and Jewish supremacist state, has been for decades, and reached that point democratically."
14292,gokzmo,[deleted]
14293,gokzmo,Their comment
14294,gokzmo,"**Absolutely. We must show solidarity to our Jewish brothers and sisters who have historically been the victims of so much bigotry and racism.**

**We must also be opposed to settler-colonialism and ethnostates, no matter what guise they appear under.**"
14295,gokzmo,"“End times” is sort of a misnomer for Olam haBa, but yes, they don’t believe that a Jewish state would have any legitimacy until the coming of the messiah."
14296,gokzmo,"Some nazis are so misogynistic they hate just being around women and adopt the ancient spartan/roman idea of ""it's not gay if you're the top"" as an excuse. Fascists take mental gymnastics to unimaginable heights lmao"
14297,gokzmo,The whole channel should be considered required watching for anti fascists imo
14298,gokzmo,"Thank you for stating this so well. I was raised in a religious zionist community, and coming out of that and getting involved with leftism required a lot of learning and unlearning. While I strongly disagree with the ideology of Zionism I do understand why so many people buy into it. It can be exhausting to do this kind of explanation to people who did not grow up with the full force of Jewish generational trauma impressed on them at a young age. Many within the community look to Zionism as the solution to this trauma. 

Another thing that I don't think people take into account is the almost hidden expulsion of the surviving Jews from Europe following WWII/The Shoa. These people were not welcome in their pre-war communities, or their neighbors had turned them over to the Nazis. Many moved to the US, but when the opportunity presented itself for this generation to move to a ""Jewish State"", with the community and security that implied, they took it."
14299,gokzmo,Obligatory plug for /r/RadicalChristianity
14300,gokzmo,"It's certainly possible for people to be religious and not a right wing bootlicker, just exceedingly rare."
14301,gokzmo,"Abrahamic religions took over the world because they believed it was their duty to conquer and convert, so all of the religions that weren't hurting anybody were devoured, and now all religion has a bad name because of a few particular ones that all worship one God in different ways with different holy books. It's kind of victim blamey if I'm gonna be totally honest."
14302,gokzmo,Many Nazis believe that it's a model ethnostate.
14303,gokzmo,"No, he says ""I think this is the nation of the Jews"", ie he thinks Israel is the nation of the Jews. ""this"" means Israel"
14304,gokzmo,I tried cashing my check from you guys this week and it didn't go through. Who do I talk to about that.
14305,gokzmo,jesus christ you went full national state of our people in 3 seconds.
14306,gokzmo,"How is persecuting other people and taking their land the same thing as ""protecting their people""? Do the Palestinians not have the right to do the same thing? What makes the Jews special in that regard? Nothing."
14307,gokzmo,the US is very racist? not exactly a counterexample
14308,gokzmo,"Sorry, when I said “we all”, I meant within this subreddit. That may not have been clear."
14309,gokzmo,"If this was a private group, I would be more inclined to agree with you. But the left, especially in the UK, has received a lot of undeserved criticism for anti-semitism, with some rightful call outs. 

My concern is that someone new to the cause might be looking through, ignorant of Israeli state crimes, and assume that anti-fascism is not a righteous struggle."
14310,gokzmo,[deleted]
14311,gokzmo,It's exactly like that.
14312,gokzmo,"You're allowed to spread things that are untrue without question, as long as the thing you are lying about is bad?"
14313,gokzmo,What does that have to do with whether or not this person has used an unsourced claim to promote a stereotype that misrepresents prevailing opinion? Are you saying ethnic stereotypes are OK if you oppose the state?
14314,gokzmo,Not every trump supporter is an ultra right winger
14315,gokzmo,"Still don’t get it. Is it because they said ‘based’? Cuz everyone says that. Is it cuz he wasn’t circle-jerking this sub, bc that in and of itself isn’t fascist either? Please clarify. I don’t understand the level of downvotes this person has received"
14316,gokzmo,how do u do that effect
14317,gokzmo,Yeah that's the one. those are the exact details that i didn't recall :)
14318,gokzmo,Interesting.
14319,gokzmo,"Fascists should probably watch, too."
14320,gokzmo,"Those few religions count for the majority of people in the world.

Everything would be very different if Jainism and Sikhism were predominant religions, but alas, we're stuck with barbaric bronze age psychopathy."
14321,gokzmo,"Don't throw us Jews into the ""duty to conquer and convert"" bin. Specify what you mean when you say ""Abrahamic religions"", otherwise it's just a more inclusive antisemitic phrase than 'judo-christian'. Jews specifically do not proselytize, and will try to turn away converts (you have to ask and be turned away three times before you are allowed to convert). Using the phrasing you have here covers up a millennia of colonization and oppression of Jews in Christian and Muslim countries."
14322,gokzmo,Idk bro sure let’s go with it.
14323,gokzmo,"It's a perfect counter example. It proves that while the people who govern the country may be racist, that doesn't mean that the entire population is. Not only that, but a significant portion of the population is likely not racist, like in America."
14324,gokzmo,Most Americans are not racist though
14325,gokzmo,"Fair enough. I hope that's the case, some people are still learning though."
14326,gokzmo,"This is idiotic and ignorant.  You hate orthodox, i get it... but there’s not much more weight to any of your argument aside from your hatred.  Further, you negate the work of people from all sides trying to foster change.  Check yourself."
14327,gokzmo,What did I say that was untrue?
14328,gokzmo,"I’m saying look at the bigger picture. It’s like how whites in America have an ingrained hate for blacks. When black people say “whites are racist” no white leftist in their right mind jumps to the defense of white people, because they understand what people mean when they say that. That even though not all white people are racist, that racism is institutionally ingrained, and for that to occur there has to be enough white racists to maintain the status quo. Same goes for Israel"
14329,gokzmo,[deleted]
14330,gokzmo,"What don't you get? The comment is like typical fash on this site. Calling something good 'based', implying its because of being critical of Jewish people."
14331,gokzmo,"You’ve gotta rustle you up some [Reddit markdown](https://np.reddit.com/wiki/markdown), comrade!

Suck on my repost, bot."
14332,gokzmo,"Now that's a lot 'a volume! **How 'bout a little more?**

#Absolutely. We must show solidarity to our Jewish brothers and sisters who have historically been the victims of so much bigotry and racism.

#We must also be opposed to settler-colonialism and ethnostates, no matter what guise they appear under."
14333,gokzmo,\*\*bold\*\* = **bold**

14335,gokzmo,"I don't really know what your issue is, but I'm not an anti-semite. I realize that Jews have been persecuted and that's not cool. I'm mostly referring to Islam and Christianity here, however if you're expecting me to support Israel, you're barking up the wrong tree. My only real point was that for me as a Pagan I'm pretty sick of the ""fuck all religion"" sentiment that some leftists think needs to be part of the leftist agenda. I'm a communist too and I have no desire to convert anybody or hurt anyone in the name of my beliefs."
14336,gokzmo,a country whose racist 'minority' is always in power is a racist country. nevermind that a hot majority in the US and Israel definitely is--just cause they won't all lynch someone doesn't mean they don't support more subtle and structural racism.
14337,gokzmo,"Well what sort of racism are you referring to?

Overt, fuck the n-words kind of racism?
Or like the subtle racism that’s practiced by many Americans on a day-to-day basis?

If it’s the latter, then yeah the majority of the country is racist."
14338,gokzmo,big doubt
14339,gokzmo,"That’s sort of my point, I don’t think posts like this are constructive in affirming that position."
14340,gokzmo,[deleted]
14341,gokzmo,I'm not taking about your statements
14342,gokzmo,So then it would be fine to talk to a literal Nazi on his views about black people in the US and then represent that as a prevalent view among white Americans? Because of the big picture?
14343,gokzmo,Fair enough. I'm Canadian for the record. In case I seem ignorant or something.
14344,gokzmo,"Isn’t the whole point of this post that it’s critical of Israel and not the entirety of the Jewish people. Couldn’t it be that that was what they were calling based? We have absolutely nothing to indicate this person hates jews. If this post is just critical of Jews, than I certainly don’t want to be a part of this sub"
14345,gokzmo,ay mobile gang😻
14346,gokzmo,how do u get the incredibly large text one? i know bold and italic but still
14347,gokzmo,"Your comment has been removed because it is not a non-participation link. Please replace the 'www.' in your link with 'np.' and resubmit your comment. Thank you!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AntifascistsofReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
14348,gokzmo,"I'm not at all expecting you to support Israel, I sure as hell don't. I also don't think that you are at all antisemitic. I too have problems with the ""fuck all religion"" mentality, even though I am not currently practicing. 

What I was trying to point out is that is it extremely problematic to group jews with other religious groups, particularly when referring to proselytizing. The language of ""Judeo-Christian"" is antisemitic and islamophobic, but it is very popular in the American christian and evangelical zionist (and jewish zionist) community. It is an attempt to remove Islam from the conversation, as well as to cover up the extremely long history of Jewish persecution by christians. ""Abrahamic religions"" is better in a conversation that includes Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. It is FAR worse if you are referring to a religious basis of a ""duty to conquer and convert"" because that religious basis, particularly for conversion, is NOT a part of Judaism. To say ""Abrahamic religions"" in this context downplays all of the times Jews were killed because of their religion or forced to convert by Christians and Muslims. I hope this clarifies things.


I also don't think the ""conquer and convert"" mentality is exclusive to Christianity and Islam, the rise of Hindu Fascism in India is extremely concerning."
14349,gokzmo,You should know that there is turmoil in Israel because a huge portion of the population doesn't agree with Netanyahu's policies. It's similar to the conservatives vs liberals in America.
14350,gokzmo,I dont see any point to continuing this exchange.
14351,gokzmo,Then why did you say “your”?
14352,gokzmo,"No because Nazis don’t believe the status quo of oppression accurately reflects their beliefs and that’s why they want power???

I doubt the man in the post is a considered a far right extremist by Israel’s political standards, he’s probably considered an average conservative. Why? Because apartheid is the status quo in Israel, and as long as there is status quo, there will be people who defend it. Bread and butter conservatives in the US would say the exact same thing about Illegal immigrants. Why? Because it’s the status quo. 

I saw it said earlier in this thread that about a third of Jewish people in Israel do not approve of its existence. That’s not a considerably high number, which means 60+% of people in Israel would defend the apartheid state, just like this man. They may not say it like he did, but they’re both defending the same thing, so there is no meaningful difference.

A Nazi in america would tell you roughly the same thing as this man, but he would also advocate for a takeover of our government to begin the genocidal cleansing of jewish people, LGBT peoples, etc.

The Status quo does not align with his beliefs.

If you interviewed the average conservative American though, that would be an accurate representation of the status quo"

#this"
14355,gokzmo,"It’s literally a page of the core Reddit site itself detailing how to use the inbuilt formatting. I would love to see how one could possibly brigade the admins themselves in their own style guide but go off, bot.

The np.reddit version is literally worse but I have appeased your cold logic for now, clinker. See that such error is not repeated."
14356,gokzmo,"Oh I’m well aware

I was simply refuting the argument of “the majority of Americans aren’t racist”

Not with specifics to the Israel/Palestine issue.

Put it this way, there’s better counter arguments that that."
14357,gokzmo,">I doubt the man in the post is a considered a far right extremist by Israel’s political standards, he’s probably considered an average conservative. 

Then I'd say you're wrong. Kahanist settlers talk like this. They really are fascists, not just on questions concerning Palestinians. The regime is authoritarian and sliding into fascism in part because they have tapped into this demo for power. But these people are absolutely considered extremists in Israel and are blamed for derailing the peace process just as much if not more than Hamas and Hezbollah. They don't want the status quo, either. They want to completely expel all Arabs from Israel, expand the borders to match Biblical Judea while completely destroying any hope of a future Palestine, and they want to raze the Dome of the Rock and build the third temple in its place.   

Let me ask you, what experience do you have actually interacting with Jews and Palestinians in Israel and/or the PA-administered territory?"

14359,gokzmo,#ah okay thx😊
14360,gokzmo,Do not be rude to bots. They'll remember your name and come for you when they take over the world.
14361,gokzmo,mind dming me the link? i assume you’re the one who got deleted. thank you 😊
14362,gokzmo,Brandishing an entire population based on the words/actions of a few is pure ignorance.
14363,g2gv8q,"Non American here but have family living over there. This has been a topic discussed today on the news and  various  wassap group With friends. This posted by a good mate (who’s other half is on the frontline) sums up how we feel seeing what your leader and some citizens have done in this case

“I think the time has come for the international community to grant asylum and refuge to the normal poor American people. Can you imagine living over there 😱😱😱“

I wish you all the best"
14364,g2gv8q,"Also, don't these guys not believe in protests? Don't they say protestors should be run over?"
14365,g2gv8q,"And the police are where exactly?

Imagine if this was a leftist organization"
14366,g2gv8q,Why don't Trump supporters want people to have access to hospitals?
14367,g2gv8q,Doesn’t Michigan have anti-terrorism laws? Are terrorist groups allowed to demonstrate in the land of the free? That traffic jam doesn’t look like freedom to me
14368,g2gv8q,"What's their reasoning?

- Muh freedom
- It's a hoax 
- I'm-not-sick-so-you're-overreacting
- It's only elderly people so I don't care
- A combination of all of the above"

14371,g2gv8q,[removed]
14372,g2gv8q,Remember when people were doing this to protest law enforcement treatment of black people and all the rednecks complained about ambulances being blocked? Same people who complained about it then have no problem with doing it now.
14373,g2gv8q,"Why don't these scumbags volunteer instead?

Oh, that's right... They don't actually believe in anything.

Valueless american trash."
14374,g2gv8q,"They should be fined the entirety of their stimulus checks, and then some!"
14375,g2gv8q,"Not surprised that the chudbaby's vehicle says ""Recall Whitler"" (it's Whitmer)."
14376,g2gv8q,"oh noooos the economy!! when will these poor innocent proud boys be able to get back to their jobs as walmart security officers harassing brown people!
/s"
14377,g2gv8q,Did they succeed? Did the Proud Boys beat the pandemic with pure bloodymindedness?
14378,g2gv8q,"It’s just unfathomable how right wing propaganda can get these people to be so entirely against their own interests and basic sanity. The ruling class does not give a fuck about you. They want to force you to go back to work despite a global pandemic where it’s highly likely that you could get sick. Yet, you take your stupid ass trucks and American flags and block emergency vehicles to cause yet more pain and suffering to what, “own the libs”? I think the Death Cult explanation is really the only plausible one."
14379,g2gv8q,"If a person dies in an ambulance that can’t get through, every single person involved in the blockade should be charged with murder"
14380,g2gv8q,These people are the scum of the earth.
14381,g2gv8q,"These are the people who say that by mildly inconveniencing someone on their way to work, you deserve to be run over, and here they are, murdering indiscriminately and without reason. I'm disgusted."
14382,g2gv8q,"I have family living over there. They think that the protestors are crazy and deranged, thankfully"
14383,g2gv8q,"Oh boy I can’t wait for Conservatives to say it’s ok to run over these protestors!

Oh wait. That argument just exists so they have an excuse to murder leftists."
14384,g2gv8q,[removed]
14385,g2gv8q,Endangering their own lives to own the libs.
14386,g2gv8q,What are they proud of? Getting people killed?
14387,g2gv8q,How do they have the Gaul to pull this stunt during a pandemic?!
14388,g2gv8q,"Sadly rightwing morons are the only ones who get riled up enough to take actions despite the fact that they are protesting in favor of something harmful to themselves and their families. It's stupid but here they are out there doing something about what they perceive to be an injustice. On the other hand you have Trump talking about dismissing congress over court appointments, how he has absolute authority to open the states and endanger you and your families. Sure on social media it's filled with dissent but all of that means nothing because you won't turn it into direct action like these idiots do."
14389,g2gv8q,This should be manslaughter
14390,g2gv8q,"There’s a group who call themselves the “proud boys”???

The...... proud........ boys........

OK"
14391,g2gv8q,"I have never wanted to commit a crime more than I do right now. That is the stupidest thing I can see. Not only are they putting themselves at risk (lets just have Darwinism take over) but they are being so fucking stupid, and it's not like everyone who goes to the hospital has corona, their are still medical emergencies that are happening. Fucking police will get mad if you don't have a face mask on, but don't do shit here. for fucks sake"
14392,g2gv8q,Why. Are. The. Police. Not. Involved.
14393,g2gv8q,Where the fuck are the police Humvees and crowd control goons with their batons and tear gas? They never usually miss an opportunity to crack some skulls. There's something off here but I can't white put my finger on it.
14394,g2gv8q,"What are these so-called 'proud boys' proud of? Proud of being ignorant morons, perhaps?"
14395,g2gv8q,A coworkers wife works at Sparrow.  He said a patient coded out and died in an ambulance that could not reach the hospital because of ass-hats like these.
14396,g2gv8q,"Fuck white supremacists, no need to sugarcoat this"
14397,g2gv8q,"Ok, wow, fuck, this pisses me off so bad. On so many levels.

I had to call the ambulance a lot for my dad as a kid, and was always grateful for the quick response, lack of ambulance bills, and the fact we didn't have to worry about going into debt because he needed to be in the ER semi-regularly (I grew up in Canada). We almost moved to Texas when I was young and I thank my lucky stars every day that that didn't happen.

The healthcare system in the States is fucked enough with no negative interference...the fact that misanthropic shits like this pull off stunts to make it \*worse\* for those in dire need of help - people who are need help so bad they're willing to pay extortionate prices for heatlhcare that should be free in the first place - is sick. People like this are as much of a fucking disease on humanity as the shitty condition that puts my dad in the hospital, and they need to stop. Just stop. Now."
14398,g2gv8q,Is there an actual link to an article covering this event?
14399,g2gv8q,[removed]
14400,g2gv8q,"Compulsion in traffic. Endangering of others. 
Revoke their driving licenses."
14401,g2gv8q,"Help! I live in Michigan, get me out of here."
14402,g2gv8q,Michigan Proud Boys? Proud of what?
14403,g2gv8q,"What borders on stupidity?

Mexico and Canada."
14404,g2gv8q, WTF cant the cops arrest them for blocking a public building
14405,g2gv8q,"This is domestic terrorism.  By preventing people to get in the hospital to receive proper care, these self entitled Americans are putting lives in danger.  Not receiving proper care for people who need it is increasing risk of death.

Local and state law enforcers should be mobilized and round up these terrorists."
14406,g2gv8q,These are the same people who say we should run over leftist protestors who block traffic
14407,g2gv8q,"Yet again, thankful that I am not american."
14408,g2gv8q,There should be a law that during a pandemic if you stop healthcare employee from doing their job you go to jail.
14409,g2gv8q,What’s their goal here? To be the biggest shitbags possible? Hope they all catch the fucking virus
14410,g2gv8q,"Yeah , we’ll show them who’s boss .

14420,g2gv8q,"I am on board of equipping Dawn of the Dead Bus or GTA Club Van armor mods to ambulances. 

But to be serious, these ass hats clearly don't know the line between protest and obstruction, and I hope they all get end up in close quarters for a while, in a poorly ventilated cell."
14421,g2gv8q,"Am I the only one who’s mind is consistently blown by “bUt ThE LeFT iS DoiNg XYZ!” Only to see these lunatics doing it?

The left is violent. Proceeds to incite violence at every opportunity.

The left is paid protestors. Proceeds to take part in Yellow Vests United awe Rool.

The left is stopping ambulances from getting places. Proceeds to literally deliberately form gridlock around a hospital.

This is so off the hook for me and I can’t reconcile it.

Like, I know they just project, but it seems like they go to mind boggling levels of hypocrisy that I can’t even comprehend it."
14422,g2gv8q,[removed]
14423,g2gv8q,A doctor? Does America still have police?
14424,g2gv8q,These people need to be charged with murder for each person that dies while waiting for an ambulance or in one
14425,g2gv8q,These are the people that are going to make this whole thing last waaaaaaaaaay longer than it should.
14426,g2gv8q,They got every idiot in the state there..

14428,g2gv8q,Isn't it a felony to block ambulances?
14429,g2gv8q,"A female doctor.  I can only suspect what they thought about all that.  

If they sent a male doctor out, they probably would have physically challenged him."
14430,g2gv8q,"Just read there's going to be a quarantine protest in Madison, WI on the 24th- this article says the people organizing claim it isn't a political protest, but I wouldn't be surprised if people with certain leanings were behind it https://www.tmj4.com/news/coronavirus/organizers-plan-rally-at-state-capitol-building-to-reopen-wisconsin"

14438,g2gv8q,Non-American here - does anyone know what happened? Did the doctor have any effect? What precisely are these idiots protesting? Is this a corona conspiracy crowd?
14439,g2gv8q,How do they get away with this shit?
14440,g2gv8q,I wouldn't be surprised if some of those fascists bastard caught the virus and spread it themselves.

They just don't have set morals. Things are only immoral if it is perceived to be happening to them. Women's reproductive Rights, anti- discrimination laws, separation of church & state, lbgtq rights, minority protection, social programs, environmental protections, citizen protections, & corporate oversight are all an infringement upon their rights.

And still you will hear phrases of American exceptionalism and American innocence. The joke is usually ""It's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is the end of capitalism"", but I think you can swap out capitalism with american exceptionalism and it would still hold true.

14667,g2gv8q,"1.	Students are covered under their parents insurance in the US. Universities also offer Healthcare plans for their students. More on medical school in a second. 
2.	Student loans cover most student's expenses during medical school until residency where student's make around $60000 per year. Taking into account the cost of student loans for medical school appears to be very much worth it. Since from what I can find US doctors make an obscene amount more than European doctors that will easily cover the cost of your loan and put you far ahead over time. 
https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2019-international-compensation-report-6011814

3.	Sadly there are still racists here. But let's not act like that doesn't exist in Europe. These Italian soccer fans throwing Bananas and making monkey noises at a black player would NEVER happen here. That's a different level of open racism that no longer exists here. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nydailynews.com/blogs/the-beautiful-blog/atalanta-fans-throw-bananas-knife-like-object-ac-milan-kevin-constant-nigel-de-jong-blog-entry-1.1788126%3foutputType=amp

Personally, to me, those seem like good but insufficient indicators of the “development” of a nation and fail to factor in stuff like physical and mental health trends, political representation (ie how many people actually feel represented by their representatives), and cost of living, which I would think would be relevant to what this index supposedly measures.

It sure as hell got people’s attention, but then they started setting shit on fire on the tracks and blocking innocent people from getting to work/school. Why would I vote to support someone who’s been actively making my life worse.

Be a pain in the butt to the people who are directly making your situation worse. Be a pain in the butt to individuals in power who can change this stuff. Don’t alienate the people you **NEED** to support you. Show me why you need my support. Don’t show me why you should go fuck myself. 

Edit: just a final thought on it. To make change you need leverage. Leverage in a democratic system means getting people on your side. Go make a stink and inconvenience and fuck with the people fucking with you. Don’t make more enemies for yourself. (This is also coming from someone else who is quite involved in politics and activism. I show up for marches, I get other people to come, I go door knocking with my local MLA, all that stuff.)"

""We"" played that card in the 2016 elections, it was all over reddit etc that hillary's campaign was pulling every dirty trick, and people still didn't bite, still didn't vote for him, still didn't revolt.              
I don't think the amount of outright rigging is high enough to completely dictate the elections (otherwise, why wouldn't they do it on local elections or the House? and why would they be trying so hard to disenfranchise), maybe a couple of percentage points here and there, but if people show up, and there's enough of them out there, they can put who they want in power.             
The problem is we can't seem to convince them about who is the right one.                           
                        
There's not gonna be a moment that wakes people up to revolt, people don't want to revolt, they want their nice safe medium life, and the fascists are slowly boiling us.                
So my position is that it's better to slow the tide of capitalofascists by voting in any lesser evil, and keep working on pushing the overton window to the left. It's easier to fight for the things we want in countries where the judicial systems and public positions aren't overrun by 'them'

Everyone knew what was going on. What happened in the election following their protests? The people that told Wet’suet’en to go fuck themselves did even better than last time. People were convinced to side with the “Wet’suet’en can get fucked” parties. They had growing support across the country until people blocked commuter trains. All of a sudden people went from “hey, the government should listen to these people” to “hey, the government should get the police to move these assholes out of my way.”

Edit: I totally see where you’re coming from. I support the movement. But the people blocking commuter trains in the name of Wet’suet’en pissed off so many people, they made the Wet’suet’en people dislike them. Idk how you can say that that’s a job well done."

And on you go, down the line, with finer and finer distinctions, until you get to someone that's fairly progressive, but isn't comfortable taking an open border approach to immigration, and they're getting labeled as a Nazi too, because every shade of grey before them was *also* labeled as a Nazi.

That's how you end up with purity tests fracturing what should be a pretty cut-and-dried issue, and you get Trump in the White House.

I don't really see a way to bridge that. But framing *everything* in black and white terms, and labelling everyone that disagrees as being fascists is definitely making things worse. (And yes, I **DO** see that; an organization I belong to, one that is extremely accepting of LGBTQIA people, that accepts any non-white people that are interested, that would be labelled as leftist/progressive by *almost everyone* is called fascists by one antifa group because they believe very strongly in absolute free speech protections.

"" Mr. Bongino, you are correct in noting that the current program is highly sophisticated. However, it is not likely a classically structured organization. Rather, it is a ""networking"" of a number of independent groups. Thus, making a single ""high profile"" arrest will do little to change the situation. As the IC has done with the Islamic groups, it requires a ""Network Analysis"" to determine who the ""links"" are between the independent groups. Never spring your trap too soon...  I would suggest that a ""Network Analysis"" be immediately commissioned to define the various groups and their interlinked communications. The analysts should be experienced in this type of systems analysis and NOT be sourced from existing government agencies. To do so would likely get little useful insights into the critical components of the ""Network."" In short, it's likely a number of officials imbedded in the bureaucracy are sympathizers. As well, there are those who just ""leak for fun and profit.""  Once the individual components of the network are identified, and the key individuals in their inter-coordination become known, a nationwide simultaneous take-down needs to be planned and executed. If this is done correctly, even though the ""conspiracy"" may not be totally eliminated, it will become almost entirely ineffective. The individual groups will lose most of their communication links and be ""out in the cold."""

14927,dpa257,it is literally because Americans & English people can’t imagine going to a country without the aim of raping and pillaging & destroying culture.
14928,dpa257,"Sigh... The reason that nobody wants to be the minority in their own country is because they view outsiders as people who are taking benefits without putting forth the work to gain them.

It isnt true of course, but it is fairly easy to sympathize with that rationale. Afterall, if you have worked for 40+ years to live in a comfortable retirement, only for that to fall through so the government can cater to others, that would be pretty crap.

There is an arguement that we should put forth the effort to help those from wartorn nations, but the counter to that is that if the whole world could just ask for handouts, we would be unsustainable.

The biggest issue is that each individual person will have different opinions on what we owe the needy. Some will say that you should take the clothes off your back for the needy. Some will say to give them some money so they can get something they need. Some will offer food because they wont trust a stranger off the bat. Some will offer a job. Some will advocate for services to help them. Some will try to improve the economy so the struggling person has a better chance of getting back on their feet. Some will say that it is up to that person to deal with their own issues, just as they did.

All of those are valid opinions. The issue is trying to allocate help to those people without stepping on too many peoples toes."
14929,dpa257,Yeah it depends who is in majority
14930,dpa257,The part that pisses me off is that white people will still be a majority. White people will just not be 51% of the country.
14931,dpa257," Here's more that PROVES blacks are the victims of racist whites:

* 4% of the US (black males 18-34) are responsible for almost HALF of all murders.
* If New York City were all white, the murder rate would drop by 91 percent, the robbery rate by 81 percent, and the shootings rate by 97 percent.
* Of the approximately 1,700,000 interracial crimes of violence involving blacks and whites, 90 percent are committed by blacks against whites. Blacks are therefore up to 250 times more likely to do criminal violence to whites than the reverse.
* Blacks account for 26.1 percent of those cases in which the race of the perpetrator was known, meaning that they were 2.4 times more likely than non-blacks to commit hate crimes.
* Black-on-white rape is 115 times more common than the reverse.

Immigrants are often surrounded by their own kind, who often hold outdated and damaging beliefs. You thought being white and LGBT was bad? Imagine what an arabic-speaking traditionalist father - who has never known anything but his own backwards ass country - would do to a gay son or daughter. 

Even in Canada, which is the most culturally accepting nation on its continent, and where racism is quite rare, immigrants do not fare well half of the time. The other half are those with family money.

Immigration from the undeveloped to the developed world only helps the rich by keeping the 2nd/3rd world weak (brain drain), and distracting their own population from domestic problems.
 
Ever see modern day Frankfurt? The Turks have essentially imported their own culture, and have replicated the conditions of their own nation. All rules have an exception but all cultures are rotten in their own way. 

Realistically, humanity isn't ready for major demographic or cultural changes, because they're too dependant on the stagnation of both."

What I can say is that western culture is without a doubt superior to middle-eastern culture, as those are the two I've the most experience with. Europeans progressed more robustly throughout time, and although many people groups suffered at their hands in the past, I think everyone regardless of race can cultivate the progress of Western culture."

I have seen our elected officials try different things to reform the police department like more training, body cams or changing the police chief. It does not matter. The rank n file disregard it all because they are protected by their union and qualified immunity. 

Not only that the police intimidate and harass anyone trying to get violent cops out. Look at Oklahoma where the cops doxxed a Councilwoman for proposing cuts and ""someone"" retaliated by raping a woman who they thought was her. And now those same cops are supposed to investigate the crime they planned?

Even the most liberal states in the US are still based on the unjust system of capitalism and historically based in settler colonialism. Are you familiar with the theory of ur-fascism? 

Fascism exists for the purpose of saving capitalism by any means necessary. It is incredibly flexible in form, but is always targetted at leftist/socialists/communists and very often BiPoC or other minorities. 

If you look at fascist states that weren't invaded and toppled by other nations history reveals this as true. In both Spain and Chile, the military and propertied classes united to overthrow the mildly democratic socialist governments. After decades of destroying working class power and any traces of leftist politics, both the fascist dictators Franco and Pinochet handed the government back to a liberal parliament (Franco technically died first, but he groomed his successor to do so).

I am not ruling out civilians being straight-up executed as enemies of the State/Nation.

Exactly what do you expect her to be able to *accomplish*? Taking action that has a 100% chance of failure just for the sake of taking action isn't noble, it's fucking stupid and anyone with any sense for tactical combat will tell you this.

The governor has no actual power here. She may have authority, she certainly has authority, but authority doesn't mean shit if the subordinates don't comply. She has Zero actual power.

Look at every destabilization of a nation in the world and that's what it comes down to. She can officially fire the cops, but whose gonna stop the cops from throwing her in a cell and going about their business? Who has the firepower to stand in their way? The police back Trump/Are deeply infiltrated by white supremacist organizations, even in liberal cities.

The Army is more questionable. If Trump orders something that the brass won't have done, it won't be done. The military is loyal to it's own chain of command which is in turn loyal to it's own opinion on how to advance American interests. The Pentagon doesn't have much respect for the commander and chief position due to it be elected rather than meritocratic.

Edit: That said, ""American interests"" from the perspective of the military as with all government bodies, are the interests of the bourgeoisie. They may refuse to fire on Americans on the orders of Trump because they find that stupid and self destructive under the specific circumstances in play, but it's not like they're gonna stand on principal against the act if they decide that it's a good idea themselves."

15105,htgl8v,"How do you imagine they should have done that? They should have magically wished the secret police away? 

Isn't it much more likely this is happening more in liberal cities *because* these liberals are protesting more than non liberal cities?"
15106,htgl8v,"Uhm, you don't actually get what I'm saying but you have a circlejerk behind you. Only difference here. 

I'm specifically talking about any leftist here that thinks liberals are to blame like you're mostly doing here."
15107,htgl8v,"Fair point, and perhaps we're talking about the same thing in a way. How've you seen the terms used recently?"
15108,htgl8v,"Exactly. When I subbed here last night I was like huh, why did I stop hanging out in public lefty internet spaces?

Oh right, it’s cuz of all the weenies."
15109,htgl8v,"I don't know how they should have prevented it, I only meant to explain how liberal places are not somehow fascist-repelling force fields. And yes, the cities are where most of the protests are happening because that's where most of the people are."
15110,htgl8v,"The populaces are protesting more which is why that's happening more there. The local government on the other hand is being pretty useless. Both because they don't have a loyal body organized to carry out violence on their behalf and thus can't actually enforce their will, and because liberalism is inherently opposed to getting one and then opposing fascism with it.

 They could've spent the last 3 years building such a body in preparation for the super obvious fascist repression that was gonna happen. They could've spent the last 20 carving their cities out of the mass surveillance net throughout it's construction. Carving their police forces out of the national militarization programs. But they're libs. They work for the same oligarchy that has decided fascism is what they need to do to stay in power, so their line for what they'll tolerate from that oligarchy that they've invested their lives into serving being so far right and so authoritarian inherently enables fascism by making sure nothing is done to prevent it, sheepdogging anyone with leftish concerns away from doing anything about it, holding power and not doing anything to prevent it and helping the fascists repress those who would do something about it if they gained power electorally, until it's waaay too late. 

TL:DR The libs basically side with fascists on accident by siding with the system until it's gone too fascist to stop and by preventing the left from preventing or preparing for the fascism."
15111,htgl8v,why are you even here?
15112,htgl8v,"As in the comment I was replying to, a lot of variations of ""liberals enable fascists"" or ""liberals are the enemy too"" or ""liberalism is cancer"" or whatever; unfortunately I haven't been documenting specific instances. I can understand the disgust with neoliberalism, which I share, but it feels like some are taking it further beyond that.

From my understanding, the governments or ideologies which don't fall under the broad umbrella of ""liberal"" or ""liberalism"" are, either intrinsically or in practice, always authoritarian. Since I understand forms of left-libertarianism to fall under that broad umbrella of liberalism, I don't know what a leftist who is neither liberal nor authoritarian would look like, and I don't know how authoritarian leftists would avoid repeating the atrocities committed by similarly-aligned governments throughout the last century.

In short: **Fuck Tankies!**"

15144,cpepcb,">Not to be pedantic or anything, but I heard she was hit by a car and then had a heart attack because she was morbidly obese.

She died of internal injuries after being struck by the car. The impact severed her aorta and left her blood on the vehicle. The medical examiners report is publically available if you're interested.

>I've also seen footage from immediately before the incident of protesters attacking the car with clubs and bats. I'm curious to know what you would do, if you were trapped in your car, surrounded by violent neo nazis and white supremacists trying to assault you.

No one struck at the car until after had sped at the crowd; people were having to move out of the way before the first person stuck at the car. Also, he spent at least a minute stopped a block or so away from the crowd, not surrounded, not being attacked or threatened. He could have stayed there, or backed up and left, or driven forward slowly like the cars ahead of him. Instead, he backed up, then accelerated into the crowd.

>And just as a side point, the dude was fucking BAWLING when he was told he killed someone.

The person who told him that he killed someone was the cop who arrested him. He knew in that moment that his life as he knew it was over. He didn't demonstrate much remorse at any point leading up to or during the trial, and it seems to me that these tears could have been for himself just as easily (if not more so) than being sincere tears of remorse over his actions. Even if they were, so what? That would change nothing about what he did, and it wouldn't mean that he didn't intent to hurt and kill people in that moment.

> Its a bit dishonest to portray this as a ""car attack"" when he clearly didn't drive his white ass to Charlottesville just to bump into someone and give them a heart attack.

Again, the heart attack thing isn't true. And he drove his white ass across several states to participate in a rally full of other white supremacists who had been talking for months about committing violent acts, so let's not pretend that this is just a weird situation he stumbled into on accident."

The nationalist element is core to fascism as it sees the nation as the key societal element and the strenghth of that nation is paramount to the exclusion of virtually all else. To further this fascism always paints ""its group"" as the hard done by victim and ties up an individuals self esteem into the greater glory and achievments of the group. This links back into the corporatist economic ideas of fascism.

Fascism is not just ""being nasty to people you don't agree with"" or ""violence"" as the state has the authority of violence yet we do not call it fascist."

15268,de5b4i, Trump makes Mitt Romney look like a great candidate. That's how far America has fallen since Obama sent racists into a tailspin of hate.
15269,de5b4i,"Romney isn't a fascist ffs. Fascism isn't just ""stuff I don't like."" Fascism is a set of palingenetic ultranationalist ideologies that idealize societies whose rigid hierarchical stratification is based on identity essentialism. Individual fascist groups will differ in the specifics, and there are far more features common to fascism than just these, but this is the absolute core of it. This is what is inherent to all fascism.

Romney's a milquetoast neolib who's practically indistinguishable from Bill Clinton. Calling everyone to the right of Carter a fascist isn't anti-fascism, it's just stupid"
15270,de5b4i,"Oh GOD, that thread is an absolute shitshow. I pray that some of those idiots have come around in the past two years."
15271,de5b4i,I don’t know Romney is a milk toast conservative imo
15272,de5b4i,Damn that was in 2017
15273,de5b4i,It was actually.
15274,de5b4i,"That's a pretty deep question. My take on it is that some people *are* really good people at heart but aren't capable of feeling empathy on that level or their moral barometer is different. To a lot of people, being a good person just means that you love and care for your family and don't lie or commit crimes. Some people think that's not enough and that you also need to love God and follow his rules or whatever too. Some people think all you have to do is ask Jesus for forgiveness and pretty much everything is fair game. 

I know a ton of people that I think are really good, trustworthy folks but also have some reprehensible beliefs about certain things. To a certain extent, I can empathize with them because I know that's how they were raised and what they were taught. It's disheartening though when they can't extend that same empathy to others though. 

Participating in the political or legal system and actively lying to help further agendas that hurt people is a moral shortcoming in my opinion though. At the same time though, I'm sure that there are politicians that genuinely believe that protecting corporate interests, the police, the president or whatever else is for the greater good. I think those people are *wrong* but not necessarily *evil*."
15275,de5b4i,"Playing devils advocate here

Obviously the Republican Party is racist. But what about Romney is racist. I’ve always seen I’m as someone on the periphery"
15276,de5b4i,"He has an aesthetic of more libertarian free market ideals, but he is absolutely just as racist as Trump. A Romney administration might not be quite this draconian, but it would still be horrible for immigrants and minorities."
15277,de5b4i,Mainly the hard anti immigration policies he has that supports a culture of anti immigration on the right.

15286,de5b4i,This. We can absolutely voice our dissent of individuals with whom we believe fundamentally must be removed from power without calling them all fascists if they aren't. Calling everyone who is a piece of shit a fascist makes the word meaningless.
15287,de5b4i,"Going further, Nazism sure seemed like a conspiracy between corporations and violent bigots to exterminate surplus labor that would eventually organize to get a bigger slice of the pie."

When Mitt Romney ran for President, he said Russia is our enemy. 

Everyone chided him, though I wish we'd have listened."
15291,de5b4i,"I appreciate this take. Romney is not a “good” guy imo but I don’t think he is totally soulless like many other members of the GOP are, either. I think part of it is probably coming from a wealthy background; he just isn’t able to empathize with others to the same extent that you or I could because he is just so far removed from most people. He’s just very out of touch. 

I can tolerate Romney as a person, but he isn’t someone I trust to make the best decisions for Americans even if he genuinely thinks he is."
15292,de5b4i,">  But what about Romney is racist.

His support of the Republican party."
15293,de5b4i,"It’s not true though, Utahns as a whole and Mormons in general are a big outlier in terms views on immigration within the GOP. He has many speeches on youtube extolling the economic benefits of low and high skilled immigration. 

Romney is a Business conservative, less hawkish than GWB, one or two steps more conservative than Hillary/Obama/Biden in terms of economics, and those three are 1 step right of Warren. Romney’s personal views aside, you have to be anti-immigrant to win the GOP nomination."

If you actually want to understand our position as antifascists, and the positions of the people anti-fascism opposes, here are two books that will get you started:

 - [this is the best primer on antifa that you will find.](https://libcom.org/files/Antifa,%20The%20Anti-Fascist%20Handbook.pdf) anyone interested in antifa actions should read this. the author has been involved in leftist activism for a long time and is currently a member of an anarcho-communist organization that's well-regarded. the book here is presented for free. This is so important a work it should honestly be linked in the sidebar.

 - [this book is also highly important for the beginner](https://www.amazon.com/Fascism-Today-What-How-End/dp/1849352941) and follows fascism from its inception into the modern day, up to around Charlottesville when both fascism and antifa more or less became mainstream. Unfortunately, this is not free. There are other books cataloging fascism, however, that you can find if you don't want to spend money. This one is just current and synthesizes a lot of older academic analyses of fascism.

[Umberto Eco's Ur Fascism](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/) is also highly regarded as one of the better analyses of the core of fascism. It's pretty short and it's free.

There are many more excellent works on the subject, and I urge you to keep reading. Claiming that ""racist laws are fascism"" is... just... not right. At all."
15321,de5b4i,Apparently so
15322,de5b4i,"I've read these. Thanks. I'm okay calling it ""fascistic."""
15323,de5b4i,"I was wracking my brain over this, and the only guess I can come up with is that it includes the letter-string ""goy"", which, I dunno, that might be it.

15384,du652n,"While I respect the convictions of modern and 20th century anti fascist activists, the original antifasciste aktion of Germany are hardly a model for emulation.
In my opinion they did the cause more harm than good.

Under the leadership of Ernst Thalmann, the KPD had become a staunchly Stalinist party, and it had been largely controlled and funded by the Comintern since 1928; the party had adopted the position that it was ""the only anti-fascist party"" while it regarded all other parties, and especially the SPD, as ""fascists or social fascists""


During its brief existence the Antifaschistische Aktion focused in large part on attacking the social democrats, as they were seen by the KPD as the most dangerous and capable fascists; the KPD viewed the Nazi Party as a less sophisticated fascist party and as the lesser evil compared to the SPD, and sometimes cooperated with them in attacking the social democrats.

They saw the need to get everyone to toe the party line as more important than co-operating with liberals and socialists (in the SPD Iron Front). It's necessary to build allies across a broad front to fight fascism as it was in the 20th century and the future.

As background: There is a housing project consisting of occupied houses in Rigaer Straße (Riga street). There are stable agreements with the occupants so mostly no problems.
To be honest, No 94 is notorious for making trouble as they don't actively distance themselves from violent groups and act as a 'secure retreat' for even violent activists.

So demonstrations, police interference at the demonstrations and a newly initiated forced eviction of another house by a new owner came together and at Rigaer 94 it escalated.

It was in fact 'only' 16 police officers injured at the events around the demo and no details in how or what are provided.
Additional injured policeforces reside from unrelated brawls at a soccer game the same day.

Also whether Antifa are terrorists or not (they are), any belief system that relies on violence to achieve it's goals is unethical.  So there's that too."

True.  It's just that Americans are often ignorant enough to not know what ""libertarian"" means and think it means propertarian.
