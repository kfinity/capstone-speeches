Thrilled To Be Back In This State That Gave Us American Independence You Know That American Steel Which We Now Have Coming Back By The Way Like Never Before And Generations Of American Patriots Thank You Very Much Thank You Thank You This Is An Incredible Time For Our Country The Unemployment Rate In Pennsylvania Has Just Reached An All-Time Historic Low That'S A Pretty Good Stat How Do You Beat That Somebody'S Going To Come And Run And They'Re Gonna Say They'Re Gonna Do Good In The History Of This Country You Just Hit An All-Time Low That'S Pretty Tough To Be We'Ve Ended The Last Administration'S Eight-Year War On Pennsylvania Energy And We'Re Unleashing Clean Coal And Shale And America Is Now Their Number One Producer Of Oil And Natural Gas Anywhere In The World Man This Is A Lot Of People [Applause] I Think Next Time We'Ll Just Have To Get A Bigger Hangar That'S A Big Hangar Looking At [Applause] Thank You Thank You Thank You Very Much And I Thought That Was The Sun In My Eyes It'S These Stupid Lights These People I Mean What Do We What Are They Doing It'S Really Way That Can Turn Those Lights Down Folks Crazy You'Ve Got A Thing Called The Sun We Like The Sun Better

In Big Trouble It Was Depleted You Know That It Was Depleted The Equipment Was Old The Planes Were All We Have The Most Beautiful Fighter Jets In The World Being Delivered Now Every Day Every Day Our Spirit Is Strong Our Stride Is Back And Our Stand Is Clear We Are Finally Putting Like I Said America First And After Years Of Building Up Foreign Countries We Are Now Building Up Our Country About Time We'Ve Got The Hottest Economy Anywhere In The World The United States Added Two Hundred And Sixty Three Thousand Jobs Just Last Month Far Exceeding Any Expectations And Since The Election We'Ve Created Nearly Six Million New Jobs Now If I Would Have Ever Said That To The Fake News Media Look At How Many Back There That'S A Lot Of People That'S A Lot Of People Looks Like The Academy Awards Used To Look Before They Decided To Go Political Against Us Now The Academy Awards Is You Know But That Includes A Half A Million Brand New Manufacturing Jobs Which The Previous Administration Said Will Never Happen Will Never Happen And It Wouldn'T Have Happened If You Had Them Or The Like Right Here In Pennsylvania We'Ve Added A Hundred And Fifty Five Thousand New Jobs Including Twenty Thousand New Construction Jobs Nobody Thought That Was Possible And More Than Five Million Americans Have Been Lifted Off Of Food Stamps We'Re Getting Americans Off Welfare And Back Into The Workforce And It'S Happening By The Thousands And Thousands And Thousands 1 Million People Have Been Lifted Out Of Poverty And The Poverty Rate For African Americans Has Reached The Lowest Level Ever Recorded The Hispanic American African American And Asian American Unemployment Rates Have Also Reached An All-Time Historic Low Those Debates Should Be Very Easy When We Meet Whoever We'Re Going To Meet Because Statistically I Mean Maybe I Don'T Know Who Knows Politics Is A Crazy World But When You Have The Best Employment Numbers In History When You Have The Best Unemployment Numbers In History When You Have The Best Economy Probably That We'Ve Ever Had I Don'T Know How To Help You Lose This Election Right And Actually That'S Just The Beginning Joining Us Tonight Are Many Terrific Pennsylvania

Worst Part Of Obamacare And We Almost Had It Repealed And Replaced But We Had One Man That After Campaigning For Eight Years He Decided To Go Thumbs Down At Two O'Clock In The Morning That'S All Right But We'Ll End Up We'Ll End Up With Even Better Because We Have Plans That Are Even Better Than That So That'S Good Sometimes When You Have Adversity It Works Out Actually Better But I Want Fred To

On Countries In Trade That The Democrats And Republicans Didn'T Do Anything About No Fairness For Years And Years China And So Many Other Countries I Don'T Want To Embarrass Cuz Frankly A Lot Of My Great People But They Don'T Understand How They Got Away With It Either But We Have To Make A Decision Soon Do We Keep Our Logo Do We Keep Our Slogan Make America Great Again Or It'S Very Risky Changing The Most Successful Slogan Has To Be They Think That Was One Of The Greatest Elections Of All Time And Now We'Re Taking The Slogan Or The Logo From That Election And Possibly Changing It But We'Ve Had A Hundred And One Or A Hundred And Two All-Time High Stock Markets Record Stock Markets We Have Just About The Best Unemployment In History Including The Absolute Best For African-American Asian As You Know An Hispanic So We Have All Of These Records That We'Ve Been Setting Our Military Strong Our Second Amendment Is Good Everything'S Good So Do We Make It Make America Great Again And

Know It Better Than Anybody What They Did To Pennsylvania In Particular Ohio Pennsylvania Some Of The States In Particular Frankly North Carolina What They Did Was Disgraceful What They Did To The Workers They Took Out Your Businesses They Moved Them To Other Countries They Sold Back The Product With No Taxes Nothing You Lost Your Jobs We Lost Revenue And Nobody Even Apologized Except Me I Said We'Re Going To Turn It Around And That'S What We'Ve Done Now We Have Companies Are Pouring Back Into Our Country They Want To Be Where The Action Is They'Re Pouring Back Including The Auto Company In The 8 Years Before My Election The United States Lost A Quarter Of A Million Manufacturing Jobs But The Great Betrayal Of The American Worker Ended On Day One The Day I Took Office And You Know That Better Than Anyone The Forgotten Men And Women Of America Will Never Ever Be Forgotten Again It'S Not Gonna Happen And They'Re Looking For You They'Re Trying To Figure Out Who The Hell Were All These People Where Did They Come From Remember The Deplorable Deplorable You Know I Watched Your Speech Well She Actually Said I Thought Worse She Said Deplorable And Didn'T You Say Irredeemable X' To Show You How Good I Am Politically I Said Oh That'S A Killer The Word Irredeemable Is - Well It Turned Out To Be Deplorable Was The Word That Caught On Right I Would Say Irredeemable Is Worse Than Deplorable What Do You Think But They Believe In Both And Not Only Her It'S The Democrats Upon My Inauguration I Inherited One Of The Worst Trade Deals Ever Negotiated It Was Ready To Be Put Into Action The Trans-Pacific Partnership It Would Have Destroyed The State Of Pennsylvania The Tpp Was A Gift For The Lobbyists And The Donors And The Special Interests And The Foreign Countries That Have Made A Fortune Hurting The American Worker The Tpp Would Have Been A Catastrophe For The People Of Scranton And Allentown And Pittsburgh In My First Week I Proudly Withdrew The United States From Further Negotiations On That Job-Killing Disaster Which By The Way Would Have Destroyed Our Auto Business Would Have Destroyed It Just Like Nafta Just Like Nafta Was Such A Disaster This Would Have Been Worse It'S No Wonder That When Joe Biden Announced He'S Running For President By The Way By The Way We Have Thousands Of People So And This Is It I'M Not Even Announcing Today We'Ll Wait For A Couple Of Weeks Okay This Is Just We'Re Going For Fred Look At The Thousands And Thousands Of People We Have Now They Said He Had 600 People Now Now Very Good Very Good I'D Say 150 And That Was Doing An Announcement Right I'D Say 150 People But He Announced He'S Running For President And He Said It'S Because Foreign Leaders Called Him Up And Begged Him To Do It Absolutely Foreign Countries Liked It Much Better That'S What They Want They Want Biden So That China Can Continue To Make Five Hundred Billion Dollars A Year And More Ripping Off The United States They Like It You Look At What These Countries Have Made We Lost On Just Trade 800 Billion Dollars On Average For Many Years 800 Billion Not Million 800 Millions A Lot 800 Billion It'S Not Even Conceivable And We Didn'T Do Anything About It And I Mean Not Only President Obama I Mean Others Too It'S A Shame But We'Re Straightening It Out It'S Not Easy It'S Not Easy Because We Have A Lot Of Assaults From Within But We'Re Straightening It Out And It'S Getting Done And You See What'S Going With China We'Re Taking In We Will Soon Be Taken In Over A Hundred Billion Dollars In Tariffs So Remember This They Subsidize Their Product People Are Moving From China Now To Go To Areas That Aren'T Tariff We'Re Going To Build Places In Pennsylvania And Others Rather Than Order It Like The Old Days Remember The Old Days We Actually Made Our Own Product Okay We Made Our Own Very Expensive For China They'Re Not Happy But That'S Okay It'Ll All Work Out Foreign Countries Liked It Much Better When They Could Push Us Around Rip Us Off And Make Us Pay For The Privilege Of Handing Over Our Jobs And Handing Over Our Wealth Eight Long Years Ago If You Remember I Said It'S Really Bad We'Re Never Going Back The Previous Administration What They Did To Our Country They Should Be Ashamed Of Themselves Sleepy Joe Said That He'S Running To Quote Saved The World Well He Was He'S Gonna Save Every Country But Ours And Remember He Said A Week Ago China'S Not A Competitor China'S Nautica But You Know Hey Look What They'Ve Done To Us Is Indescribable Economically We Have Rebuilt China They'Ve Done A Great Job And I Don'T Blame China I Don'T Blame President Xi I Don'T Blame Them Look We Allowed It To Happen Our Leaders Allowed It To Happen Well It'S Not Happening Anymore Iran And We Have Saved America We Made America Great Again And We'Re Gonna Keep America Great That'S What It Is And If You Don'T Mind We'Re Gonna Take A Little Bit Of Money Out Of The Hundred Billion Dollars That We'Re Saving We'Re Gonna Take A Little Bit Of Money Okay Doctor Get The Same Doctor Get The Same Doctor He Was Great Are You Okay Okay We'Ll Be Okay Go Ahead Take Your Time [Music] Take Your Time I Love These People [Music] [Music] Take Your Time [Music]

You Did [Applause] Okay Thank You Thank You Very Much Great Job Thank You So The Very Same Establishment That Sacrificed Our Prosperity Weakened Our Military And Tied Us Down Through Endless Wars That Never Ended Folks They Never Ended You Saw What We Did With The Caliphate Now You Have To Understand These People Are Stone-Cold Crazy So You Never Say You Won Because Then They Blow Up A Store They Hurt And Kill People They'Re Totally Crazy But We Beat And Took A Hundred Percent Of The Caliphate The Area The Land Took A Hundred Percent And Did It Very Rapidly Very Rapidly Hope We Want To Start Bringing Our People Back Home We Win And Bring Him Back Home And Now They'Re Asking Us To Repeat History And Relive The Same Failures All Over Again The Failures They Brought You Like You Wouldn'T Believe And We'Re Never Going To Let It Happen One Of The Worst Fiestas From Our Former Leaders Was The Disaster Of Nafta All Buildings In Pennsylvania In New England All Over They Were A Total They'Re Empty And Even To This Day Some Were Converted To Nursing Homes Some Were Taken Over But You Still See The Shock Of What They Went Down And Now We'Re Replacing Them With Brand-New Beautiful Buildings We'Ve Got It Up We'Ve Got It Working Again All Over The Country We'Re Building Plants And Factories Like Actually Forever Before Nearly Two Decades Ago The Same Politicians Who Gave Us Nafta Also Voted To Admit China Into The World Trade Organization A Disastrous Really Decision I Mean That Was A Disastrous Decision Since Then We'Ve Lost 60,000 Nut Jobs Listen To This 60,000 Factories Here'S The Good News We'Re Building Them All Back They'Re Coming Back You Know I Used To Give That Because It Was Really Two Years Ago So Many Have Come Back But I Used To Give That Number And I Used To Say It'S Got To Be A Mistake You Can'T Lose 60,000 Factories And When The Fake Dues Didn'T Correct Me I Knew That I Was Correct Because If I Was Off By One Factory They Would Have Said He Made A Mistake Past Leaders Let China Freely Plunder The United States Economy And Take The Crown Jewels Of American Industry Now We Are Finally Responding To Years Of Chronic Trade Abuses By Defending Our Workers With Tariffs And Anything Else That'S Necessary Because Nobody'S Going To Steal Our Businesses Nobody'S Gonna Close Our Factories And Nobody'S Going To Close Our Plants Any More They'Re All
