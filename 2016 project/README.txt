Hello!

We ran "2016 scraper.ipynb" first, to pull the 2016 candidate speech data from UCSB, do some preprocessing, and store it in /data/
That data's included, so you don't need to run it.

"2016 testing.ipynb" just creates the plot "2016_all_speeches.png"

"2016 text analysis.ipynb" does most of the work - some preprocessing, our Naive Bayes classifier, some plots at the end.

"Naive Bayes Classifier.ipynb" runs our data through the SciKit-Learn MultinomialNB classifier

Thanks!
