Prime Minister forgot to do something for so many decades we\\'ve been losing tens of billions of dollars to China and Japan and India and named any country yeah we lost but we\\'re not losing anymore and I said listen we got to do something sixty eight billion dollars in trade losses over the last four or five years a year so we\\'re renegotiating and I think he\\'ll be fair I think he\\'ll be four and by the way he he started by saying that he\\'s putting 40 billion dollars into the United States for new car factories Toyota\\'s coming in with 14 billion dollars and they\\'re coming in frankly to Michigan they\\'re coming back they want to be back to Ohio to Pennsylvania to North Carolina South Carolina Florida and what\\'s the name of this special place is called Wisconsin [Applause] so they\\'ll be investing very shortly and it started already 40 billion with the be forty billion dollars and it\\'ll be a lot more than that the poverty rate for Wisconsin families has reached the lowest rate in 22 years [Applause] the unemployment rate for Wisconsin workers has reached historical has never been this low before ever ever ever think of that [Applause] never been historic law and we\\'re now the number one economy anywhere in the world and it\\'s not even close [Applause] by the way Saturday night is there any place that\\'s more fun than a Trump rally [Applause] can you imagine sleepy Joe crazy Burnie you look at the candidates right I think Pocahontas she\\'s finished she\\'s [Applause] no when it was found that I had more Indian blood in me than she did and then it was determined that I had none but I still had more that was the end of her 32 year scam on colleges but can you imagine any of these people up here doing what I\\'m doing they\\'d be 200 people show up if they were president if they weren\\'t president nobody would show up is that right [Applause] I have to say I was saying on the way over there tell me about bad weather by the way we may have to cancel tonight I said are you crazy how can you imagine I learned this morning they thought you\\'re gonna have a big snowstorm right a big big saucer the people that get it wrong the most are the weather forecasters and the political analysts now they said there\\'s a big big storm it\\'s gonna be hitting Green Bay we may have to cancel I said like hell we\\'re gonna cancel people are standing out 24 hours ago thirty two hours ago outside who stood out there for 24 hours thank you we love you thank you thank you and you know what and you rewarded with the best seats in the house right [Applause] America\\'s futures never been brighter yet the Democrats very friendly I\\'ve never been angrier than they are today you see somebody else with a very low level of energy we\\'re supposed to be standing here instead of they wouldn\\'t be in this room [Applause] that or not I got some problems I would say that but you know if you look two weeks out in 2016 I was going to rallies we were doing five and six like this and there were thousands of people outside just like there are right now we had sixty nine thousand people sign up to come in what is this place all in like 10 or 12 or whatever whatever it homes we set the record I just was told by the owners wizzy owner I don\\'t know what the hell it halls but we just set the record [Applause] wizzy owner is this your record thank you thank you that\\'s always dangerous he said yes it is Sir so is dangerous yes like what no sir I\\'m dead they will take they will take that answer that\\'ll be headlines thank you very much you saved me now this is the record we sent records everywhere and it\\'s not me there\\'s a movement like we\\'ve never seen in the history of but the radical Liberal Democrats put all their hopes behind their collusion delusion which has now been totally exposed to the world as a complete and total fraud the greatest political hoax in American history early husband so this witch-hunt was never really just about me it was always about stopping you the millions and millions of freedom-loving citizens who rose up on that incredible November day and demanded a government that puts America first ok and we\\'re doing that with China we\\'re doing that with India we\\'re doing that with Japan we\\'re doing it with a great new trade deal that hopefully will get approved in the house I hope they go to approve it cuz it\\'s great for the farmers everybody wants it everybody loves but we\\'re all signed up and getting ready I guess in 30 days to put it in the u.s. MCA like the song YMCA right you remember us MCA that\\'s with Mexico and Canada it\\'s a great deal and it\\'s going to be very really good for manufacturers and really really because they have to ratify it you know they have to approve it and frankly with what you have today maybe they\\'d rather have us have a loss then do something that\\'s good for the country right because NAFTA is one of the worst trade deals ever signed in the history of our country you look it around Wisconsin but you still see the scarves empty buildings you up to New England you go to Ohio you go to different places NAFTA was a disaster and what we had the one thing I wanted more than anything else I want to make it almost impossible for a company to leave Wisconsin and leave other states and go to Mexico and go to other places but go to Mexico fire it\\'s work open a new plant in Mexico hire other workers and sell the equipment into the United States I don\\'t want that and we\\'re not gonna do it it makes it virtually not economically viable that\\'s what I want so it\\'s gonna be great I hope we can get Congress to get it approved quickly because it\\'s going to be fantastic for everybody in this room and especially manufacturers and farmers and people aren\\'t going to be firing people and moving their plants to other countries [Music] [Applause] remember that spell we were going through before I was a politician remember can you believe I\\'m a politician I can\\'t even politician but remember that spell where everybody was just leaving the country and going into Mexico Canada Mexico Canada and Canada has been taking big advantage of your agricultural products you know that you know Canada we love to Soho Canada let\\'s say no Canada we love the song but I came up here a year ago and I was with farmers and they were selling specialty milk now you\\'re getting killed for years two hundred and ninety seven percent tariff that means you can\\'t sell it that\\'s essentially putting up a barrier so all of those things are taken care of in this new deal and you\\'re gonna be opened up it\\'s gonna be good for everybody it\\'s gonna be good for everybody and if they didn\\'t approve I would have just put tariffs on the cars I would have done that I didn\\'t want to do that I didn\\'t want to do but I said if that\\'s not gonna happen we\\'re putting tariffs on the cars and frankly we\\'ll make more money but the farmers wouldn\\'t be helped so much but you watch the company grow and prosper as you starve that\\'s no good right so we like it and it\\'s good actually it\\'s good for Canada it\\'s good for Mexico it\\'s good for us we gotta get Congress to improve it so put a lot of pressure on these geniuses we have over here that\\'s gonna be a great trade deal and we\\'re very close to making a deal with China but who knows I always say who knows cuz you would have those the deal is either gonna be a great deal has to be I told President she\\'s a friend of mine I said listen this can\\'t be like a good deal for moe this has to be a deal cos we have been losing to China for many years five hundred billion dollars a year we have rebuilt China we\\'ve given them so much more think of it and that\\'s cash you know they can say it\\'s surplus they can say it\\'s deficit call it whatever we were losing cash we\\'re giving them five hundred to help can you do it and as Prime Minister Robby said to me today said nobody\\'s ever talked to me this way [Applause] he said it friendlies a friend of mine but he said nobody from this country no president has ever sent this you know that nobody ever even talked about it will lose 75 for big in a year Japan as an example sells us their cars the cars coming no tax they don\\'t take our cars other than that it\\'s a very fair to you so the cars come in two centuries two and a half percent but essentially it\\'s no tax or agriculture they don\\'t want it we want to sell the agriculture so they sell cars we sell practically nothing that\\'s how we have these massive imbalances with so many countries now China is the big because with China it\\'s at least three hundred and seventy five billion dollars here deficit honestly in all fairness to Obama this was him but this was before Obama a long time before Obama this has been going on for a long time and all I\\'m telling you is if we don\\'t make it deal we\\'re gonna do even better okay we have all the cards don\\'t forget we\\'re the piggy bank that everybody\\'s robbing whether we\\'re the ones with the piggy bank that everybody is stealing from and robbing and taking advantage of but no matter how hard they try to stop us they can\\'t because our love for America will always be stronger than a corrupt thirst for power this I don\\'t I tell you what you know people say oh he wants to take over the country he wants to extend they don\\'t believe I\\'m leaving in six years he wants to extend he wants to have presidency for life these are sick people I promise at the end of six years they\\'ll be very happy but you\\'re gonna be left with the strongest country you\\'ve ever had [Applause] all right USA USA and that\\'s right and that\\'s what this fight is all about we\\'re taking on the failed political establishment and restoring government of by and for the people it\\'s the people you\\'re the people you are there and if you look at what\\'s happened with the scum that\\'s leaving the very top of government people that others used to say oh that\\'s one then dirty these were dirty cops these were dirty players you take a look at what\\'s going on there\\'s 21 of them already and I\\'m not even doing they\\'re just leaving because they got caught like nobody ever got caught and in the truest sense of the word what we are doing now is draining the swamp that\\'s true [Applause] I mean we\\'re draining the swamp but are we having a good time and look at all those beautiful red hats and some white rocks [Music] [Applause] look at that those are that\\'s a lot of red hatsan but you do have the white ones too right and yet the black ones to have a lot of them you have a lot of different eyes but let me just say so we have to make a decision you want to make it tonight so we\\'re doing great the country is doing great we\\'re rebuilding our military we\\'re doing so many things listen so we have a decision to make we may have the greatest theme in the history of politics it\\'s called make America great is go make a country [Applause] it\\'s called maggot country you know I didn\\'t hear that term until that third-rate actor in Chicago went out and he said I was beaten up by maggot country can you believe now that\\'s a hate crime right he said he was beaten up by maggot country turned out to be a total lie but think of it mega make America great again and by the way I have to tell you that case in Chicago is a disgrace to our nation [Applause] so so we have a decision now if this weren\\'t the greatest thing I really believe but it\\'s been said but make America great again Ronald Reagan you seldom let\\'s make America great close but not the same let\\'s too complicated doesn\\'t work but Ronald Reagan was good he said let\\'s bake but he didn\\'t use it who use it a little bit we seriously used it right maca and maca we got for free cuz my whole deal was make America great again all of a sudden people to say going hashtag mag guy but we have a choice to make it a decision to me so very shortly we\\'re gonna say you see what we did with our vets we have choice we have accountability where you can fire we have a lot of things okay we\\'ve done so much our military is like gonna be very soon in great shape we took a hundred percent of the Caliphate in Syria everyone said oh you\\'re never gonna bid and by the way by the way and when some whack-job that picks up something over the internet goes out and blows up a store and people get killed I understand that happens I understand because these people are sick they\\'re demented but we nevertheless in terms of a war we took a hundred percent but you\\'re going to have these cells and they\\'re going to do damage and it\\'s a shame and we\\'ve got to stop them we\\'ve done a great job but we got to be careful we gotta be these are sick horrible human beings if you even call them human beings so we got to be careful and you know what when you see and I say this because we have a massive televisions do you ever see so many cameras if somebody else were here you\\'d have about like none just like the Academy Awards used to be before they started hitting us and their ratings started falling like a rock [Applause] so we have a choice the man ready so make America great again the problem is we\\'ve made America great versu we\\'re gonna have a couple of things to do we should have had health care but one man decided to vote against us at the last moment even though he campaigned for eight years repeal and replace but that\\'s okay that\\'s okay because we\\'re coming up we win we\\'re coming up with a great package of health care we\\'re gonna be the party of health care we\\'re coming up with a great package after the election we got to take back the house we\\'re gonna win the Senate gonna win the president but we got rid of the individual mandate that\\'s a big thing that was the worst particle so here\\'s what our decisions do we use for the new campaign which will be starting soon we have the great Sarah Huckabee over [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Thank You mr. president obviously I thought it was going to be a little warmer here in Wisconsin it\\'s pretty hot in this room tonight Thanks thanks to all the amazing things you\\'ve done for our country last year this night I was at a slightly different event not quite the best welcome so this is an amazing honor I\\'m so proud to work for the president they said he couldn\\'t win in 2016 and he did they said that he couldn\\'t make our economy better and it\\'s booming they said he couldn\\'t rebuild the military and he\\'s done it they said there was collusion and there wasn\\'t they\\'ve questioned him at every step and he\\'s proving them wrong every single time because of all of you Thank You mr. president for leading now she doesn\\'t get it she doesn\\'t get she doesn\\'t understand me after all these years she\\'s becoming too popular I\\'m jealous Sara you\\'re fired [Applause] she was wondering what was that all about she\\'s been great and danced Covino and Mike and the whole group and Madeline [Applause] now they\\'re great people and they really love this country what they\\'ve been through they\\'ve been through a lot they\\'ve been through a lot of phony stuff the witch hunts they\\'ve been through a lot so we\\'re delighted to be joined tonight by many incredible Wisconsin Republican leaders a really great friend of mine a man who is really the focus of what\\'s going on in so much of Washington very tough guy very strong guy I call him Wisconsin tough and I don\\'t even know if you know it and I don\\'t know if you appreciate it but I\\'m telling you he\\'s really good Ron Johnson [Applause] thank you running a great job he\\'s doing a big job now I can tell you that he\\'s working on some things that are very important and members of Congress Bryan style Bryan thank you Brian [Applause] Glenn Grothman [Music] [Applause] this guy every time I introduce him you know I love champions I don\\'t care if it\\'s in sports just like champions so he\\'s your tree climbing champion you know hunter for five years and that\\'s Eddie\\'s he\\'d go up and come down he said the hard part was coming down because you\\'d get killed if you missed but for five years he was the champion the world champion five years and he\\'s with us tonight and I\\'ll tell he\\'s our champion he fights so hard he\\'s working on a reciprocal trade bill so if somebody charges us a tariff of a hundred percent or fifty percent or 25 percent we say thank you very much we\\'re going to have a reciprocal tax of twenty five [Applause] what could be wrong with that and he\\'s leading the charge and he\\'s got tremendous enthusiasm but he\\'s a great guy and he is a great champion Shawn and his wife by the way is better than Shonda [Applause] and another great friend of mine somebody that\\'s been so effective Mike Gallagher Mike thanks Mike [Applause] and thanks also to was Council House Majority Leader Jim Steiner key thanks yeah great Wisconsin Senate President Roger Roth Senate Majority Leader scott Fitzgerald thank you [Applause] these are great people they\\'ve done so much for us that we have other leaders in the room but we all know who they are they\\'ve been incredible the Republican Party\\'s been incredible after just the first two years time America is winning again and America is respected again all over the world no more games all over the world [Applause] since the election we\\'ve created more than 6 million new jobs nobody would have believed that if I said this when I came here often I came here often remember I came and they didn\\'t like certain people that were with me they booed the hell out of those people but they liked me that\\'s all that mattered if I would have said 6 million jobs were going to create by this time two and a half years can you believe how time flies two and a half years already I said the other night I remember first night standing in my bedroom I should say our bedroom with our great first lady I said did you believe first night I said here we are here we are in the White House and four years sounded so long away and now four years is coming up with two and a half years and no administration has done as much as we have in the first [Applause] [Applause] thank you and by the way yesterday was our first lady\\'s birthday and people love it we\\'re about the same age but if I would have said that we would be in June areas creating six million jobs people would have left 600,000 manufacturing jobs remember President Obama said manufacturing jobs a gun you need a wand a magic wand we found the magic wand because they\\'re coming and they\\'re coming fast does it Rachel in the state of Wisconsin alone we have created 23,000 brand new manufacturing and construction jobs a record [Applause] and after years and years of declining wages wages are rising for the first time in 21 years and you know what\\'s nice because I have a couple of friends here they\\'re pretty wealthy people very successful people and you know what the hell with them I don\\'t care I care about everybody you know what I love you know what I love I love the fact that wages are rising fastest for the lowest income Americans [Applause] you know when they say it hasn\\'t trickled down the most success percentage-wise the most successful are the lowest income Americans there\\'s something great about that and people that are now able to go out you know we got veterans choice we also have employment choice because you never had a chance you had to stay in a job that you hate it or you couldn\\'t get a job now you can go out you have seven alternatives you get a job that you love and you get much higher salaries it\\'s great [Applause] and you\\'ve heard me say this a hundred times but I say it again and I\\'ll keep saying the unemployment rates from african-americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country [Applause] and remember this if I make any mistake if I\\'m off by just a little tiny bit those people back there will be headlines so I have to be very careful fake news they\\'re fake they are fake they are fakers [Applause] I\\'ll tell you you know what sucks their ratings suck because we have cut 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register that\\'s an all-time record it\\'s never happened before we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in our nation\\'s history and you know something that is very important to me and very important to because of you to keep family farms ranches and small businesses together in the family when you pass on and go to heaven so you can look down at these great children and if you don\\'t like your children don\\'t listen to probably a couple of you out there to say you know I don\\'t like the kid I\\'m not leaving on my damn far anybody in here like that raise you but on the assumption that you love you kids and you love your family and you want to leave the farm you remember what used to happen the estate tax was 45 50 55 percent they had to go out and borrow money and sometimes the land is worth more than the income and they couldn\\'t do it and the banks end up and the banks fight them and that\\'s not what they do for living the kids and they lose the farm they lose the ranch they lose the small business right well we have eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax or all of those zero that\\'s a good one after decades of kilometers straight deals that stripped away our wealth literally stripped away this country\\'s wealth and our jobs and so many other things took away our dignity when great companies would leave the United States for another country because of stupid taxes because of stupid regulations because frankly in some cases and the unions are gonna work on this I tell them you got to work on this you got to have a little flexibility because there are other choices but now the choices are going to be other states they\\'re going to be competition but you know what now America fought back and all of these companies are coming back into our nation again they want to be where the action is and the era of economic surrender is over that\\'s what we did we would like remember that I used to do when I was a civilian when I had no idea I was gonna be running for president right I had no idea I used to say what the hell is going on in Michigan they gave me an award six years seven years ago I had no idea it was the man of the year in Michigan I went to Michigan I said do you people know what\\'s happening you\\'re losing all your car companies they\\'re all leaving they\\'re going to Mexico Canada they leave they\\'re leaving they\\'re going to China do you know what the hell is and this was before I was thinking about running for office but I\\'ve been saying it for 20 years and now we\\'ve stopped it those companies are wrong coming back [Applause] when the Wisconsin timber industry was threatened my administration took immediate action we imposed tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products and saved countless timber jobs all across this great state and you know that you know that job big difference right they were losing you\\'re losing a lot of jobs and they were taking the timber from other states and other countries nope not anymore we\\'re doing good before I took office one of the gravest threats to the future of American manufacturing was the previous administration\\'s trans-pacific partnership you think NAFTA would have been bad this would have made NAFTA look like a good deal the TPP would have decimated US manufacturing and gutted America\\'s auto industry it would have gotten the industry and they were dying to do this crazy deal I also ended up another one you know the great Paris Accords how is Paris doing lately how\\'s Paris how\\'s Paris to send to all the money to countries that the people never heard of and raised their taxes I ended that one too I thought I was going to take a lot of heat on that one saved a lot of money saved a lot of jobs saved a lot of it they said you know when I end this Paris Accord I\\'m gonna take heed I didn\\'t even take heed Mike people understood it it was a ripoff it didn\\'t allow us to use our wealth would have stolen our jobs but just take a look at what\\'s happening to other places where they\\'re trying to do it and we had something we would have never ever been able to adhere to the rules that were so strict on us you know China can sign rules they\\'re not going to be sued by Greenpeace if Greenpeace goes to China that\\'s the end of Greenpeace you\\'ll never see him so China doesn\\'t care of the violate Greenpeace and some of these other wonderful environmental groups but the United States gets sued and we adhere to these things it\\'s a little bit different we would have lost our ass on that deal that would have been a terrible deal and that\\'s why I was willing to take the heat but there was going I\\'m still waiting I guess at some point they\\'ll bring it up they\\'ll probably bring it up Bernie Sanders will say what I\\'ll say take a look at Paris sort of Saturday after there Bernie how they doing over there good the yellow vests how they do it I don\\'t think so good and they\\'re great friends of mine but I don\\'t think they\\'re doing so good that\\'s why in one of my first acts as president I withdrew the United States from the one sided job killing disaster known as TPP TPP what a mess that was another one of these deals that were set up for the strict purpose of taking wealth out of the United States for the benefit of those other countries that were in the deal it was a one-sided horror show America will not be taken advantage of any longer [Applause] for years we gave foreign nations free and unfettered access to our economy while they constructed massive barriers to American exports we give them you come in take us it\\'s wonderful we want to go there no we don\\'t do that we don\\'t accept your product oh that\\'s wonderful as one example we charge other countries zero tariffs on foreign paper products but when Wisconsin paper companies exported abroad they sent their product abroad China charged us big tariffs India charged us big tariffs Vietnam charged us massive towers unfair reciprocal trade chong reciprocal trade [Applause] look at harley-davidson look at Harley does I met with them three years ago one of my first meetings Harley Davidson I said to the people they\\'re very nice they would tell me tough to do business in certain guys how you doing in India they said oh we don\\'t do any business said they weren\\'t even complaining because for so many years so India charged a hundred percent tariff on a Harley Davis but when they send their motorcycles and they make them to us we charge em nothing so I called up Prime Minister Modi I said unfair he cut it 50% but I said that\\'s not good enough because look it\\'s 50% to nothing and what we\\'re doing is changing all of that stuff changing rapidly and that goes for military protection also that goes for military protection also where we are getting ripped we\\'re defending the world we\\'re defending wealthy countries that can well afford to pay us but they\\'ve been getting this free military or at least massive partial subsidies for so many years it\\'s almost like habit it\\'s more habit than anything else nobody does anything about it but we do there\\'s one country we lose five billion dollars I would say I don\\'t want to embarrass anybody the last thing I want to do is embarrass but they lose we spend five billion dollars a year defending them right so I said to the generals how much do we spend next thing sir we spent five billion dollars very wealthy country I said how much do they pay sure they pay five hundred million dollars I said you mean we lose four and a half billion nails to defend them and they\\'re rich so I called the country right I called the country so we lose forward a half billion for the privilege of defending a country that\\'s very tough on us on trade and so I called I said listen so good now they were to say the shot because they never got a call like this in 25 years I said it\\'s no good we\\'ll lose in four and a half billion dollars it\\'s no good we can\\'t do this anymore this is crazy and he got very upset angry this is not fair I said of course it\\'s fair he said well we\\'ll give you five hundred million more because the budget you see had already been set there\\'s only a month left so you know I said you know what I want more we argued so they paid us more than five hundred million for one phone call it took me one call now I\\'m not breaking I hate the deal [Applause] Ron knows one call his first call they\\'ve had it in 35 years I don\\'t think they have a had a call one-sided horrible deal so I said it\\'s okay you know I understand your budgets you know you go through a budget next year which now turns out to be in about two weeks I said we\\'re gonna call you for much more you got to pay you gotta pay not fair we\\'re defending you and you rich you know we can defend people they\\'re not rich and they\\'re being horribly treated and human rights and all this that\\'s different these are rich countries but think of it one phone call we pick up five hundred million that\\'s not terrible but now we\\'re gonna pick up a lot more and we have that with many countries look Saudi Arabia very rich country we defend them we subsidize Saudi Arabia they have nothing but cash right we subsidize and they buy a lot from us four hundred and fifty billion dollars they bought you know you had people wanting to cut off Saudi Arabia they bought four hundred and fifty billion dollars I don\\'t want to lose him but the military we subsidize Saudi Arabia I called the king I like the king I said King we\\'re losing arrest offending you King and you have a lot of money [Applause] and he said but why would you be calling me nobody has ever made such a call before I said that\\'s because they were stupid so we\\'re working to deal with so there\\'s so many things so many things I\\'ll tell you what honestly it\\'s easier than collecting a hundred and thirteen dollars and fifty seven cents from a tenant in a bad location in New York City and it\\'s safer too it\\'s easier it\\'s true it\\'s easier okay now for that but it\\'s true so we\\'re getting ripped off and trade we\\'re getting ripped off for military NATO I\\'m all for NATO but you know we\\'re paying for almost a hundred percent of defending Europe and they\\'re killing her son trade the European Union the EU is killing us we lost 181 million dollars that were defending them for peanuts it does it does this make sense to you what I\\'m saying and in the meantime your taxes go up although they actually because it may have gone down so I guess the International Trade Commission recently announced that under the US MCA American dairy exports to Canada are expected to surge by more than 50 percent okay we got to get the deal done Ron you got to get that deal you\\'ll get it done got to get it done and my first 100 days in office I traveled to this very state to sign an executive order declaring that we will live by two simple rules by American and higher American right here [Applause] but while we are unleashing America\\'s economic read or the new agenda of the Democrat Party it\\'s not the Democratic Party it sounds but they were to change their name it\\'s much better but why should I make their name sound good right the Democrat Party radical left they should change that do call it officially the radical left Democrat Party would drive our nation into economic and financial ruin very quickly and they will take your guns away too by the way nothing is more dangerous than the Democrats crazy immigration agenda we wanted solved we\\'re building the wall by the way we\\'re gonna have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next [Applause] you know we can get money for anything they were willing to give me money for every single thing more money that I wanted I said I don\\'t need that much money give me money for the world we\\'re not giving you anything for the wall you know why because politically they don\\'t like it so I went out and did it a different way and we have the money for the wall and we\\'re building the world because their entire party has been taken over by far-left radicals who want to nullify and erase American borders they want open borders they want open borders they want people and they think that\\'s gonna be votes ultimately for them these left-wing extremists don\\'t believe America as the right to enforce our immigration laws or decide who gets to enter and remain in our country not gonna be that way and think of Border Patrol we apprehend a hundred thousand people a month you know what that is Democrats want to allow totally unlimited uncontrolled and unchecked migration all paid for by you the American taxpayer the Republican Party believes America has not only the right but the absolute duty to control our borders and to enforce our laws [Applause] and we believe the immigration system must put the needs of American workers and families first and people can come into our country we need people to come in we have so many companies coming they need workers but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit and we will always support the heroes of ice and Border Patrol these are great here last month alone 100,000 illegal immigrants arrived at our borders placing a massive strain on communities and schools and hospitals and public resources like nobody\\'s ever seen before now we\\'re sending many of them to sanctuary cities thank you very much they\\'re not too happy about it I\\'m proud to tell you that was actually my sick idea hey hey what they why did they say we want him I said we\\'ll give him to you thank you they said we don\\'t want yet well wealthy liberals preach open borders they live behind gates and guards they send their families to the best doctors and private schools and while pushing immigration policies that drain the public services every day citizens depend on you and they depend on you I depend on you because we can change our immigration laws I used to say in 45 minutes it\\'s really 15 minutes it\\'s so simple but we need Democrats to vote on it otherwise we can\\'t change them and they don\\'t want because number one they don\\'t want to give us a victory we\\'re gonna take it anyway we\\'re gonna take the victory but they don\\'t want to give us something on that issue and number two they don\\'t mind open borders and obviously open borders bring tremendous crime they don\\'t mind crime if you can believe the border crisis is also driving and very strongly the drug crisis the biggest crisis we have drugs its people and it\\'s drugs and it\\'s traffickers cartels traffic huge quantities of heroin meth cocaine and fentanyl across our southern border drugs that claimed the lives of 80 90 and maybe even a hundred thousand people a year and ruin the lives and the families of so many more to confront the border crisis I declared a national emergency the good news is everybody [Applause] now everybody\\'s they look at those caravans we just had a caravan for 20,000 people and we told Mexico I said listen if you let those people come through your country we\\'re gonna close the damn border we\\'ll close it I don\\'t [Applause] they got to bring them back I got to bring them back you mainly they got to bring them back the flood of illegal migration is the direct consequence of Democrat backed policies that prevent border violators from being promptly returned home they\\'re allowed to stay in our country catch and release they\\'re allowed you catch them and then you have to release them in a sprays Congress has to fix these horrible immigration laws we have to end human smuggling stop human trafficking shut down sanctuary deport criminal element and replace visa lotteries and chain migration with immigration systems based on skill and talent and merit [Applause] Ron Johnson\\'s gonna do it Ron congratulations stand up run will you get that done for me please no get it done for Wisconsin Eldo on issue after issue the Democrat Party has never been further outside the american-made ship I mean it\\'s crazy what\\'s going on with them oh do I look forward to running against them they are pushing a one hundred trillion dollar government takeover of the US economy known as the green New Deal we\\'re gonna rip down every single building in Manhattan and build a new building in this place they\\'ve introduced a total federal takeover of US health care that would abolish the private health insurance of 180 million Americans many of you are in this room right now and they are aggressively pushing extreme late term abortion allowing children to be ripped from their mothers right up until the moment of birth and just this week your Democrat governor by the way we have Scott Walker\\'s here great government he did a great job he\\'s a great governor got a big future but you\\'re Democrat governor here in Wisconsin shockingly stated that he will veto legislation that protects Wisconsin babies born born Allah the baby is born the mother meets with the doctor they take care of the baby they wrapped the baby beautifully and then the doctor and the mother determined whether or not they will execute the baby I don\\'t credible no it\\'s incredible until this crazy man in Virginia said it nobody even thought of that right they didn\\'t would even think of them yeah late term but this is where the baby is actually born and came out it\\'s there it\\'s wrapped that\\'s so two protectors in life I called on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting the extreme late term abortion so Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion hoaxes and delusions the Republican Party is the party for all Americans that\\'s what it is and common sense with a party of common sense with the party of the American worker the American family the American Dream with the party of the Second Amendment and its protection [Applause] and everyday we are making good on the motto promises made promises kept last month I signed an executive order with Charlie where are you Joe where\\'s Charlie where is the man he\\'s like 14 years old I can\\'t believe 25 can you believe this guys what a job in honor of him he worked so hard and for those of you who think that youth is a door to our side just look at this audience tonight look at what Charlie with me amazed I was watching the other night the NFL Draft can you believe it and it was the second draft choice and he gets out mosa and he gets out real he\\'s gonna be a great player from Ohio State and he\\'s a mag affair he loves Trump he loves backing you got a lot of young people out there you want to know the truth I actually think we have more than they do who knows but I think we have more than they do he\\'s gonna have a great career last month I signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campus and if they don\\'t give free speech they lose billions and billions of dollars in that\\'s okay and we\\'ve launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs so important last year prescription drug prices went down for the first time in 51 years okay [Applause] it\\'s gonna go down a lot for got it down I was a big deal not by much but you know it\\'s always gone up a lot 18% 6% 9% it went down and it\\'s gonna step going down cuz all of these very complex things that we\\'re doing is starting to kick in we\\'re gonna get them down and maybe on that one we\\'re going to work with the Democrats to be honest because they want to get it down too and we\\'ll see if we can put it all together but prescription drugs look it\\'s a rigged system okay if I told you how crazy it is the web it\\'s a web you need 193 IQ to even understand this web of geniuses they put this thing to lower a drug price it as 19 effects here and 27 we got it down and we\\'re getting it down further we have the smartest people the best people in that world working on it and we might be able to get Democrat support we\\'re vastly expanding affordable alternatives to Obamacare we repealed Obamacare\\'s unfair and very unpopular individual mandate where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having health insurance that was very bad and will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions the Republicans are always going to protect pre-existing conditions we\\'re unleashing American energy and getting Washington bureaucrats off the backs of hunters fishers farmers and everyone who enjoys our great outdoors and we\\'ve committed to providing I think you\\'ll like this and Ron and those great congressman the job in this room are working hard on it we\\'re very close three hundred million dollars for the Great Lakes restoration initiative and we\\'re building the new su locks to protect jobs and commerce throughout the entire Midwest sue locks and I\\'m pleased to report that earlier this month Interlake steamship company announced plans to build the first Great Lakes freighter in 35 years just north of here in Sturgeon Bay how did you know 35 years and that just means more jobs more jobs more jobs to keep America safe we are rebuilding America\\'s Mighty Mite we are rebuilding our military like never before in the history [Applause] that includes brand-new combat ships from Marinette and more than 6,000 brand-new armored vehicles from Oshkosh [Applause] and we\\'re boldly defending American and dressed just yesterday I announced that my administration is unsigned the UN arms trade treaty we run signing we\\'re pulling it back out of the United Nations we\\'re pulling it back out of Congress all of you Second Amendment people you know [Applause] because we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on America\\'s freedom we\\'re not gonna allow that was a President Obama disaster I also went through the United States from the absolutely horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal what an impact that\\'s had you know when I first became president the first week I met with our great military people and we went over problems and one of the biggest problems was were and they were all over Iran was all over the place they were over I\\'ve never seen anything like it 14 different conflict zones Yemen Syria all over and small battles I said what do you do with these people I withdrew from that horrible deal where they paid 150 billion to Iran they paid 1.8 billion in cash probably for hostage by the way I got 22 hostages out [Applause] and the other day our great hostage negotiator made the statement that Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator this country\\'s ever had so you know what so I put it out I put it out why not you know a lot of times if you\\'re not going to brag about it nobody else is you might as well do it so our ambassador made the set and the press picked it up and they were going after me it\\'s not true it\\'s not true and then he called them and he said no it is true and instead of saying it\\'s true they stopped talking about fake news I recognized Israel\\'s capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and I would have opened in 25 years but I said to our great ambassador David Freeman one of the most successful lawyers in New York he became ambassador to Israel I said David they want to spend 1.1 billion dollars we could do it cheaper they want to buy this piece of land in Jerusalem top dollar I said David what can we do and he called me back he said sir we have a piece of land that\\'s much better and on that piece of land we have an old building and we\\'re not using the building very much and we can renovate the building for $400,000 and we\\'ll have a beautiful embassy in a better location and we can have it done and sir we can have it done in four months instead of 25 years so here\\'s your alternative a building at a great location in four months for $400,000 or a building that will probably never get built but let\\'s say 20 years for 1.1 billion today meaning three four billion dollars in a lousy location that won\\'t be as good as what we built and it\\'s the first time I\\'ve had ever done this he said four hundred thousand I said David it\\'s too cheap we have to make it it\\'s true I said make it five hundred thousand and it\\'s open we opened it like almost a year ago and you know in New York I have a friend he\\'s a very successful guy and he\\'s very proud of his office because he used to thing called Jerusalem stone this is stone from Jerusalem it\\'s one of the most expensive she considers it a treasure and every time I go and it\\'s just oh look at my beautiful stone is from Jerusalem so we\\'re building a building in Jerusalem I said David do me a favor by Jerusalem stone you right there we got it so cheap you wouldn\\'t believe and the whole damn building is made practically of Jerusalem stone it\\'s beautiful so we got it open in four months instead of twenty or twenty-five years and we saved at least 1.1 billion and it\\'s a great embassy right now it\\'s a great great thing that\\'s great and just weeks ago I announced that the United States will recognize he\\'s really sovereignty over the Golan Heights so that\\'s been under consideration for 52 years for 52 years they told me they\\'ve been studying if they\\'ve had summons many many meetings summits people coming from all over the world talking about the Golan Heights and then they\\'d leave this is very important strategically for victory Heights you\\'re a PI very important 52 years ago it started and I did it like quickly done it\\'s all done and we also recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and we strongly condemned the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime and you see what socialism does that was one of the wealthiest countries in the world now it\\'s one of the poorest and to those who would try to impose socialism in our country we see nothing but trouble we see nothing but poverty and we will say again tonight that America will never be a socialist country ever [Applause] [Applause] great what is crowd has a lot of it is a hell of a crowd Saturday night we\\'re having a

the hell got that thing that\\'s that that\\'s it trap I\\'m telling you it\\'s like it\\'s like ridiculous you know what I\\'m saving that for don\\'t pay the bill okay because that is crazy fellas so next time you know we don\\'t want to have that can you imagine if I went down the press would have a field day for weeks and weeks they say he went down he finally he made a mistake look at that isn\\'t that terrible isn\\'t that terrible [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] well I just want to say hello Panama City Beach it\\'s a nice place we had some we had some great times here you remember before that that great election a great great election 16 right 16 and now we have 20 coming up who would believe November 3rd not November 8th that\\'s November 3rd and it\\'s going to be just as special as November 8th to be justice and in certain ways I can\\'t say it\\'s more important but it\\'s equally as important because we\\'ve made strides like no country has made strides what\\'s happened to our country but we had a great time and we had some incredible rallies right here and we\\'re working really hard for you and we\\'re going to talk about that in a little while things are going well okay well you got hit with a little hurricane called to Michael that was not a nice surrogate I can tell you that but it\\'s going well and I\\'m thrilled to be here with really truly incredible men and women of the Florida Panhandle my friends your strength and devotion and values are what truly make America great and what make America run you know that you love our country you\\'re proud of our history and you always reach the great American flag so I was last year in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Michael you remember we came I was pretty bad stuff and I pledge to you unwavering support and the support of our nation until you have fully recovered and rebuilt and we will never ever leave your side we\\'ve already given you billions of dollars and there\\'s a lot more coming as you do it and to support your recovery from hurricanes Michael and Irma the federal government is committed more than ten billion dollars to the state of Florida\\'s committed to all committed and Rick Scott and your new governor\\'s a great Governor Rick was great Ron de santis is great so now rick has gone on to the Senate along with Marco Rubio and they\\'re all working we\\'re all working together and things are going good for you and for our country thank you I love you too thank you whatever the hell you are I love you and tonight I\\'m pleased to announce that my administration will be allocating 448 million dollars in HUD disaster recovery funds for the great people of Florida these dollars will help communities get back on their feet we\\'ve already given you many many millions of dollars but these are additional monies that are coming in to help the families put their lives together some families are still working very hard it\\'s been a tough one more money is needed I\\'ve just come from a stop at Tyndall Air Force Base where I saw the devastating effects of that category five hurricane category five never heard about category fives before category five is big stuff Tyndall was scheduled as you know by the military to close you know that right you know that and I got a call from your great representatives and they said president they want to close Tyndall because it got beat up badly it got beaten in fact we have our best planes there the f-22 was it\\'s incredible incredible fighter jet the most beautiful plane I think I\\'ve ever seen and some of them were damaged but we lost none we\\'re lost none seven were very badly damaged and the military had it scheduled to be closed and I heard about it and I made a couple of calls and I said general why are we doing that those people are incredible those people they work they\\'re just outstanding I said general why are we doing it and they said you know it was damaged I said so what are we gonna do build a new a new one someplace else in a bad location I said we have thousands of people we\\'re going to end up having 8,000 people back there working so we\\'re rebuilding the whole place and we\\'re actually moving in the f-35 fighter jet which is the newest and the best in the world and we get a lot of them we\\'ve got a lot of them and they\\'re gonna be moving in so we\\'re gonna have actually many more people working at Tyndall than you had the day before the hurricane and they\\'re doing drawings and they\\'re doing architecture of different areas we\\'re building some new buildings we\\'re fixing some old good ones that got very badly hurt but structurally they\\'re sound and when we\\'re finished it\\'s going to be something that\\'s really special what are the best anywhere in the country okay and you have something very special I was with Colonel Laidlaw who runs it you know oh good he\\'s a good man and he was telling me the reasons and he said we fly right over the ocean we get up we fly right out over the ocean when you do that sir you can do a lot more then when you\\'re flying over people\\'s houses we know that feeling - so it\\'s been it\\'s gonna be fantastic and the wake of the terrible storm this extraordinary community pulled together and showed the world your unbreakable spirit down here a lot I knew that long before the storms by the way and you\\'ve also seen countless volunteers and visitors students and faith groups coming here to lend a hand to help like almost no place else you can imagine and of course people are still travelling from around the world to enjoy your son I happen to be one of them by the way and your sand and your pristine waters which is exactly what you have because Panama City Beach is open for business as beautiful as ever and today I\\'m doing the most allowed by law to support the people of Florida because of the severity of the storm category five we will have the federal government pay for 90 percent of the cost [Applause] and we can do that because of the incredible devastation and the size of that storm so now we need Democrats in Congress to work with us to pass an acceptable bill we\\'re getting close it\\'s pretty tough dealing with it they don\\'t want to build a wall but we\\'re building the wall they don\\'t want to do a lot of [Applause] so we\\'re building a lot of things we\\'re doing a lot of things that includes additional hurricane Michael relief funding immediately the money is coming immediately no games no gimmicks no delays we\\'re just doing it and by the way FEMA by people at FEMA feet and elsewhere by the way they had this the Ann Texas that Puerto Rico Puerto Rico got 91 billion dollars and I understand they don\\'t like me it\\'s the most money we\\'ve ever given to any anybody we\\'ve never given 91 billion to a state we\\'ve never given we gave to Puerto Rico 91 billion and I\\'ll tell you the services you look at the Marines you look at the Navy the job they did there was really incredible I brought a chart would you like to see a chart [Applause] very haphazardly I just happened to have it with me so there\\'s your charge does everyone see so now see I don\\'t want to spend in a big board cuz that costs the government too much money I want to say but you don\\'t see that that\\'s Puerto Rico and they don\\'t like me Texas Florida the biggest hurricanes we\\'ve ever seen Texas Florida but this and what the Democrats want to do they want to give more and more and I say you know what I have a great relationship with the people of Puerto Rico but it hasn\\'t been fair the way they\\'ve treated all of us from the standpoint of their leaders because they complain they want more money you got 91 billion it\\'s the largest amount of money ever given for hurricane to a state to any element and that\\'s the way it is but you\\'re getting your money one way or the other and we\\'re not gonna let anybody hold it up are very grateful to Donald Trump for what we\\'ve done for them that was a bad that was a bad storm you know with with Florida thank you with Florida you drive on yeah you drive on with Puerto Rico to do the tougher it\\'s called its cost yeah it\\'s so you get into something but they did a hell of a job including bringing the biggest hospital ship in the world right off the islands so I want to thank the military I want fimA for what they did there for what they did in Florida Texas you look at Louisiana look at South Carolina they got hit hard North Carolina got a piece of it Georgia Alabama these are great places and they\\'re all getting aid but the Democrats are trying to stop it but you get again don\\'t worry you\\'re getting it and you\\'ve already gotten a lot of it so that\\'s instead of wasting time energy taxpayer dollars on partisan stunts and hoaxes and witch hunts Democrats should be focused on building up our country did you see what just happened by the way no collusion [Applause] two years on a witch hunt I could have gotten anybody in this audience I could have found something on you two years almost 40 million dollars 20 Trump haters Democrats anko angry Democrats after two years nothing no collusion and now the Democrats we have a great Attorney General now the Democrats are saying we want more you know it was going to be like we want the Muller report now they say Muller report no we want to start all over again it is a disgrace we got to focus on infrastructure we have to focus on lowering medical prices and medicine always focus on our military and our vets which we\\'ve done and the Democrats really should be focused now on restoring and helping the Emerald Coast of Florida because that\\'s what it is it\\'s time to come together for the people of Panama City for the people of Florida for the people of our country it\\'s time to stop this nonsense they think they\\'re gonna win did you see the one man the only way we\\'re gonna beat him in 2020 they have to do this the only way they well that\\'s a compliment I guess but think of what he said it\\'s the only way they\\'re gonna beat B and actually it\\'s working the other way because now we have our best poll numbers that we\\'ve ever had so we want to work with them and we want to do infrastructure we want to do all of the things that you know about and we\\'re gonna get it done nobody\\'s done so much as all of us because it\\'s not just me I\\'m a messenger I\\'ve done a good job as a messenger I\\'ve done a good job but you\\'ve done a great job because you came from all over you came from all over you voted they didn\\'t know you they didn\\'t know that you folks existed in many cases the invisible people and you know what you are

President of course they do so they can continue to ripoff the United States I think if I heard that I\\'d ever vote for and then you have Bernie Bernie Burnie you got some real beauties crazy burning we had a choice between slippy Joe and crazy Burnie and I\\'ll take it here let\\'s just pick somebody please let\\'s start this thing [Applause] boo-boo hedge hedge they say edge edge he\\'s got a great chance says he he\\'ll be great he\\'ll be great representing us against President Xi of China that\\'ll be great that\\'ll be great I want to be in that room I want to watch that one by the way you see the tariffs were doing cuz they broke the deal they broke the deal so they\\'re flying in the vice-premier tomorrow\\'s flying in good man but that broke the deal they can\\'t do that so they\\'ll be paying we don\\'t make the deal nothing wrong with taking in over a hundred billion dollars a year we never did that before and we have that happening a lot of good things happening with a lot of countries we ever deal with Mexico we ever deal with categorical NAFTA how bad was NAFTA all the empty buildings all the empty plans we have a great deal with Mexico and Canada we got to get the Dems in the house to approve it and if they don\\'t that\\'ll be okay - we\\'re gonna do something else we\\'ll be just as good if not better you always have alternatives folks when they wanna hold you up which is a hold up when they want to hold you up for political reasons you always have to have alternatives got a lot of good alternatives sometimes better some of it\\'s better our economy is now the hottest anywhere on earth and it\\'s the envy of the world every time a foreign leader a president a Prime Minister a king a queen a dictator we got some of them too every time they come into the office they say congratulations and what you\\'ve done for this economy it\\'s a hottest on earth it\\'s incredible every single time that\\'s how they start off the conversation and you know it because the people of Florida are truly benefitting by what we\\'ve done internationally and nationally so thank you and our policy can be summed up in three very simple words jobs jobs jobs the United States economy created another 260,000 jobs last month way way way above what people thought they were making predictions much lower than the big one they were thinking about 1% one point two percent maybe one point five and our growth number came in for the first quarter which is almost always the lowest quarter of the year historically 3.2 percent crushing expertise a lot of surprised people I wasn\\'t to play since the election we\\'ve created nearly 6 million new jobs including more than half a million manufacturing jobs and nearly 700,000 new construction jobs numbers that if I would have said this during the campaign those people back there I call them the fakers fake news media the fakers would have said he exaggerated he exaggerated they are a bunch of fakers there\\'s no question about it but you know in six years they\\'re all going to be out of business folks now if we want to drive them crazy I\\'ll say in 10 years they\\'ll go crazy see he is a despot he is a despot well 10 or 14 let\\'s see what ever will I watched it\\'ll be headlines tomorrow Donald Trump wants to break Constitution out unemployment just reached the lowest rate in more than 50 years the women\\'s unemployment rate is the lowest in more than 65 years and soon will be a record number remember last election know he\\'s going to do so bad with women I did great with women we did great with women Hispanic American unemployment just hit another brand new all-time historic low african-american unemployment recently achieved the lowest rate in the history of our country and likewise Hispanic American unemployment lowest in the history of our country I\\'m gonna like that on the debate stage you\\'ll be hitting me left right I\\'ll say the lowest rates ever in history highest income ever in history for the different groups highest income more people are working today in the United States almost 160 million that have ever worked in the United States before and nearly 1 million more African Americans are employed today than when I took office think of that [Music] [Applause] that\\'s right I just screw that 14 more years now fourteen more years after many years of stagnation wages are rising very fast has it happened in 20 years and they\\'re rising fastest which makes me feel very good for blue collar workers fastest proportionately and dried whole agenda is a jobs boom that is historic has it happened like this in many many years if at all certainly during record-keeping has not happened like this and it has a lot to do with the fact that cut more federal regulations and regulations than any president in the history of our country so these great companies now can breathe and hire people [Applause] and we just passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history the largest and we get rid of the individual mandate of Obamacare the most unpopular and by the way we would have repealed and replaced so Bhama care but one vote didn\\'t work out after campaigning for eight years this particular person decided that the last moment to go No it\\'s all right we\\'ll get it anyway doesn\\'t matter because we\\'ll end up getting better we\\'ll end up doing better sometimes you know things like that happen and you get angry and you get a little bit sad and then some of you weep I don\\'t wait but you don\\'t weep too much I know too many of you they never weaved in their life they didn\\'t weep when they were babies but you get a little bit angry about it and you know what you do you go and you fight and it ends up being better than what you were trying to do in the first place that happens and a good one for those of you that love your children of which I would think probably it\\'s 95% to keep your family farms and ranches and small businesses in the family they don\\'t talk about this we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so now if you love your child or your children and you have a beautiful farm ranch small business it\\'s doing great you know the old days meeting like about two years ago they had to go out borrow money from a bank lose their business in many cases now you don\\'t have a tax you don\\'t have a tax so if you love them good if you don\\'t love them I would leave it to them and it\\'s not going to matter it won\\'t help you much but if you love your family that\\'s what\\'s going to happen it\\'s great thing we\\'re reducing burdens in our businesses but in return we expect American companies to invest in America which is what we\\'re demanding to raise wages in America which is happening and to hire American workers to do the job [Applause] and as I stand here floating around on a piece of ice this is crazy I\\'m a little bit concerned about leaving the podium I\\'m hoping you have no idea what I\\'m going through on this stage this is the worst damn stage I\\'ve ever stupid people did this one or brilliant or brilliant they may be the enemy if it\\'s the enemy then they\\'re brilliant but I want them the hell out of here and we\\'re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that are rich Wall Street at the expense of Main Street you see what\\'s happening although everyone\\'s doing well right now everybody the companies are doing great when Wall Street does good that\\'s a good thing for us a lot of you have 401 k\\'s where they\\'re double what you had just a couple of years ago I tell this happens a lot but for some reason this big policeman you might have heard it but his big strong guy comes to me I was in New York and he said sir thank you my 401 K and that was a year ago this happens all the time he said his 401 K 47% he said my wife used to think I was just horrible at investing and now she thinks some of the greatest investor in the world and I think now the numbers are much better since then but that\\'s the 401ks everybody\\'s through the roof of the way to keep it that way we\\'re gonna make it better and stronger and we\\'re gonna take in a lot of money from a lot of these countries and other folks that have been ripping this off for a long time I mean we pay for the military and with defending nations that are so rich and I say to him King you got to do me a favor you\\'re gonna pay but nobody has ever asked for money I said no no you got to pay you got to pay we\\'ll lose billions and billions of those individual countries and you know it\\'s one thing if we\\'re helping people who are being horribly treated and they don\\'t have money and the countries are it\\'s one thing it\\'s another thing if we\\'re dealing with countries that are loaded with cash make a fortune and when defending them for a tiny fraction of what it costs it\\'s ridiculous so it\\'s all changing lot of changes [Music] one country won\\'t say the country but one country we spend a lot of money on defending very dangerous territory and it costs us five billion dollars and I said to a general please do me a favor general tell me how much does it cost for us to defend this country which is very rich sir I will check he comes in and up sir it\\'s five billion dollars sir I said that\\'s okay now how much do they pay us sir they pay us five hundred million dollars I say we lose four and a half million dollars to defend a country that\\'s rich as hell and probably doesn\\'t like us too much can you believe it and we\\'ve been defending it for many years so I called the leader of the country I said you know it\\'s not fair we\\'re spending all of this money great danger and we have our men and women they\\'re the best in the world and we\\'re sending them over to your country not fair you got to pay you got to pay and he said like the king he said but nobody\\'s ever asked us that before from I said that\\'s because you had stupid people running so they said they said thank you he said just what ifs I could give you a hundred stories like this he said that we can\\'t do anything now because it passed our so-called Parliament and so we can\\'t it doesn\\'t come to when\\'s next year he said two months I said alright pay me something now how much will you pay we can\\'t pay you more than five hundred million dollars I gotta said this one phone call right so I said make it 750 now that\\'s a long way short of four and a half billion that were losing but I said make it 750 anyway we agreed to a number around 500 million it was one phone call that lasted for 10 minutes and once they got over the shock of being are there plenty of money and now the two months is up and I just told my people call them and ask for the rest of it okay but we have many countries like that I mean we have many countries like that we have countries like Saudi Arabia very rich another Mukesh right so I think they can afford to pay us right for defense and they will and you know what they will and they\\'re buying a tremendous amount of equipment four hundred and fifty billion dollars they\\'ll be spending in our country four hundred and fifty billion but we have a lot of countries that are rich that we\\'re defending and they don\\'t even respect it honestly when I asked them they almost so looking at me saying I sort of thought you know like it\\'s amazing that nobody\\'s asked us now they don\\'t say that they\\'re smart but you feel it so a lot of countries we\\'re defending it\\'s not fair what\\'s happening they\\'re paying us a tiny fraction in some cases we defend Europe it\\'s not fair they\\'re not paying what they should be paying we\\'ll work it out but you gotta pay those and you know what in the end they\\'re gonna like us more and in the end they\\'re going to respect us they\\'re gonna respect that under the previous administration the United States lost nearly a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs you remember that they let other countries raid our factories steal our jobs and robbed us blind other than that they were very nice they allowed China to freely loot our economy plunder our intellectual property and target our industries for destruction that\\'s what was happening and look President Xi is a friend of mine great guy but he was vagina I\\'m for the USA I\\'m for the USA so we\\'re gonna see they come in tomorrow whatever happens don\\'t worry about it it\\'ll all work out you know why it always does don\\'t worry about it there\\'s no pressure because you know with a piggy bank that everybody wants to rob you understand that so we have the thing that everybody wants we\\'re now the biggest market in the world by far I\\'ll tell you China was catching us if another person happened to be in this position right now first of all there\\'d be about 10 people instead of all the people hey I wish the cameras could spin around and show this massive feel you know they won\\'t do it they won\\'t do it they never do it they don\\'t like to show it and you know I actually try and explain the ones in a semi friendly I said you know it\\'s good for your production Valley to do that your production values are much better yep let them know it [Applause] now look at this field they never show it they will show the people behind me congratulation they may have a lousy seat but you know what they\\'ll be famous tomorrow but it is true they never like to show the crowds I went to Texas and I made a speech and bado bade oh boy is he falling like a rock what the hell happened to beta so we went to El Paso and I made a speech and we had an arena that holds eight or nine thousand people the arena was packed we had 35,000 people outside we had these massive movie screens outside so those people that couldn\\'t get in could see he had 502 people the next day in the news the New York Times guy actually wrote a story that he thinks that he had more people than men can you believe this no no can you believe it now so dishonest and most of them just said to massive crowds were well his crowd was not massive he had like 502 people according to the people that count crowds so we get a very bump press but that\\'s okay cuz we\\'re here and they\\'re not right a very dishonest people and maybe it\\'ll change you know what\\'s wrong with having a strong military good education a strong economy I don\\'t get it I don\\'t get it I don\\'t get it the hatred is incredible but let\\'s just keep it going folks because that\\'s the way it is [Music] [Applause] but the great betrayal of the American middle class ended the day that I took the oath of office because I\\'m with you I\\'m with you and there are those that say even the fake news media there are those that say it was the greatest day in the political history of this country is the greatest election and it continues you know because they keep trying to take it away let\\'s try to take it away that\\'s not working too well that\\'s not working but for think of it I mean Hillary Clinton is still going up I think they sold the election brodo she lost to the next time no no the next time [Applause] the next time she\\'s got to go to Wisconsin to campaign you know it hadn\\'t been lost in decades the people are graded in Wisconsin you have to go there and campaign the people said oh you\\'ll be ok the Republicans haven\\'t won the great state of Wisconsin in decades he\\'s got to go there I went there a lot and in all fairness her husband Bill who\\'s a good politician they didn\\'t listen to him he said you better go to Wisconsin you better go to Michigan I\\'m seeing a lot of things out there I see a lot of signs Trump Pence Mike Pence is he doing a good job by the way a good job and his wife Karen is doing a great job Mike but I see a lot of Trump in signs out there on the lawns you better go there and they sort of said what the hell does he know well he\\'s a pro he\\'s a pro he knew a lot better than their analysts their analysts weren\\'t so good but you have to go and you have to work and we are officially in a couple of weeks we\\'re starting can you believe I got to the White House two and a half years ago and the first night I stood on the area the beautiful residence they call it\\'s beautiful I said to Milania do you believe this it\\'s going to be so long it seemed like four years would never happen and now we\\'re a year and a half away less think of it it\\'s incredible how time flies especially when despite the obstacles and the artificial things they put in your bath especially when you love what you\\'re doing and more importantly I love the results of what\\'s happening because you hear them so I just announced it will increase tariffs in China now we won\\'t back down until China stops cheating our workers and stealing their jobs and that\\'s what\\'s gonna happen otherwise we don\\'t have to do business with them we don\\'t have to do business we can make the product right here if we have to like we used to remember like we used to the era of economic surrender the last administration also signed a disastrous trade deal with South Korea that cost our country nearly 100,000 jobs but it was really 250,000 jobs and if you remember our Secretary of State at the time and our president at the time said this will give 250,000 jobs and he and she were right except it was for South Korea not for us it\\'s a loser and we totally renegotiated the Korea trade deal to restore these jobs and rescue the American auto industry because that was going to be a tremendous hit and that deal is done South Korea and right before I came into office our nation was being signed up for a one-sided single sellout like you\\'ve never seen of the American worker and I said it\\'s not going to happen the trans-pacific partnership was going to destroy our automobile industry like you\\'ve never seen before and our automobile industry is pouring back into our country and today for the people of the great state of Ohio remember you have to win the great state of Ohio boy did we win it we want it by like nine points it\\'s a great state so everyone\\'s coming back in Toyota\\'s coming in Honda\\'s coming in many many car companies General Motors today just announced three big plants 450 workers 700 million but the big announcement is in Lordstown Ohio they\\'re going to be selling that plant to workhorse it\\'s called they make electric trucks because the enemy with all of the companies pouring into Michigan all of the companies pouring into Florida North Carolina South Carolina Ohio everywhere with all of these companies they kept hitting me with Lordstown because General Motors closed it well they did the right thing they sold it to a company that\\'s going to do a great job with that beautiful plant and that happened just a little while ago sister they\\'ll be spending a lot of money and fixing it up it\\'s subject to the UAW they got to get out there and make a deal you aw come on got to make a deal but that\\'s a great thing right because that was the only thing they could hit me with though they could never hit me with anything because we\\'ve been so good but they said what about Lordstown what about Lordstown I\\'d call up Mary Barra will you make a deal or open it please I\\'m getting killed with that plant anyway today she called they\\'re gonna be opening it\\'s gonna be a great company going there\\'s really wonderful in another historic action we finalized an agreement to replace the horrible NAFTA trade deal with the brand-new US MCA like the song MCA the u.s. MCA will mean countless more jobs for Florida farmers ranchers and growers and manufacturers but while we\\'re unleashing an unprecedented wave of prosperity the Democrat Party is trying to return us to the failures of yesterday they want to have things rejected because they\\'re all waiting for 20/20 they think the more they could hurt us the worse they make us look I think you\\'re making us look better personally I really do I really do I mean they want to do investigations instead of investments they want to do what they\\'re doing which looks so foolish and maybe I read it wrong but I think it drives us right on to victory in 2020 because people get it people do but our country the great USA is not being pushed around anymore nothing is more dangerous than the Democrats crazy immigration agenda Democrats believe that everyone in the world has the right to violate our borders they want open borders disrespect our laws and come into our country and collect benefits courtesy of the United States taxpayer thank you very much [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so despite the fact and you see the hell we\\'re going through trying to get the wall which by the way works they say we want to give him drones we want to give him technology without the wall nothing works folks you know that so we\\'re gonna have over 400 miles of wall built it\\'s already the much of it\\'s already started by the end of next year and we\\'ll conclude it pretty shortly thereafter we\\'ll have the whole thing sealed up and it\\'ll be a lot easier it\\'s very tough when you have the worst laws on immigration the worst loopholes catch and release you catch somebody and then you have to release them oh that\\'s a wonderful plan chain migration you come in and you bring your whole damn family and if you know good you got people all over the place this is chain migration the other one is visa lottery it\\'s a lottery who\\'s coming to the United States so these countries put people in a basket like little did it who is it who is it ah let\\'s see well that\\'s beautiful this guy isn\\'t he like a stone-cold killer yeah take the even tell me if the United States is accepting people under a lottery system compliments of Chuck Schumer if they\\'re accepting people under a lottery system do you actually think that the country is giving us their finest oh no they\\'re giving us some rough people I won\\'t say it if you remember what I made the speech at the base of Trump Tower I talked about what\\'s happening I mentioned the word rape I was absolutely by the fake news media they went after guess what that speech was so mild compared to what\\'s actually happening that you read it today and it\\'s like unbelievable but Democrats say they care about the poor but their open border policies drive down wages Dre in social services that are the poorest Americans more than anybody else and the crime that comes in is unbelievable you know read it they don\\'t want to talk about it sanctuary cities a total disaster Republicans believe that you the American citizen have the absolute right to have your laws and borders enforced and enforced strongly it\\'s your country we believe that a welfare program should be protected for truly needy Americans not for illegal aliens that come into our country illegally we believe that our immigration system should put the jobs and safety of American families first we want to help people we want to be gracious and we want people we need people frankly because we have so many companies moving into our country where the hottest country they want to move their plants that we need people they have to come in through merit merit last month alone 100,000 illegal aliens were apprehended at our borders you know that is they catch them they take their name they have to bring them to a court they take them into a court then they have to release them because we have tens of thousands of people in detention base and they can\\'t release them now we did win a great court case last night go back to Mexico and I told Mexico very nicely that you can\\'t let people walk mm we\\'ll be country because if we do that we\\'re going to close our border if we have any more we\\'re gonna close our border I don\\'t care what it flows with close our border so Mexico now for the first time has been taking people back to Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador and other countries and for the first time not big enough numbers but they\\'re getting bigger they getting bigger we can\\'t have this folks we can\\'t have this this is crazy what\\'s happening and what we really need more than anything else we need the loopholes close everybody knows what they are Asylum asylum they walk in they read a statement by a lawyer written by a lawyer at the border who probably gets paid by somebody that\\'s not exactly friendly to this crowd I am very fearful of my life my country is a very frightening place to be please help me in the meantime there\\'s tattoos all over his face and they say no no he\\'s the one that causes the frighten and he comes in and he talks about his country but then they have a picture of him five days sooner walking up flying the national flag of their country so be so afraid of his country why is he flying the flag of the country right they want to fly the flag of Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador right into our border save that flag we love our country we love our country but we\\'re afraid of it for purposes of getting into the United States we\\'re afraid of our country now we can\\'t let this happen the Democrats we need the votes we have to do we need the votes otherwise you can have to vote them out of office Congress the Senate you\\'re gonna have to vote them out of office come November next November November 3rd next year you\\'re gonna have to vote them out of office because otherwise you can\\'t make a change we need the votes we have to go through Congress how we ever ended with itself is incredible but they don\\'t mind it so much because they don\\'t mind crime they don\\'t mind crime no nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws and no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America\\'s borders shouldn\\'t be allowed to run and to confront this crisis you saw that it was a big deal two months ago I declared a national emergency which is what it is this is an invasion when you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people that\\'s an invasion I was badly criticized for using the word invasion it\\'s an invasion and it\\'s also an invasion of drugs coming in it\\'s an invasion of drum they all better be careful because you know we\\'re destroying the lives of hundreds of thousands of people a year with the drugs that are pouring across our southern border they better damn well be careful because people are wise to it now they have drug dens and drug labs and factories right along the border they make the crap right there and they send it over our border where we don\\'t have walls they drive it right through because we have 2,000 miles between the Gulf and the Pacific 2,000 miles now a lot of it you don\\'t need the wall because it\\'s mountains it\\'s big strong rivers it\\'s snake country nobody\\'s walking through Nerys you got a lake snakes a lot they got some rough country but we need and what we need we\\'ll have done but they can\\'t do this they can\\'t let this happen and we\\'ve been very tough with them I\\'ll be honest Mexico made a hundred billion dollars on average over the last ten years hundred billion they took 30% almost of our automobile business we make cars they send them through the United States that won\\'t happen anymore under the u.s. MCA it\\'ll be prohibited our current immigration crisis is the result of Democrat back policies that prevent border crosses from being swiftly returned home a border cross that comes in you say sorry we\\'re taking you home and that\\'s if you\\'re nice and I want to do that okay but we\\'re the only one that has judges judges think of it they come across we have judges with the only nobody else\\'s judges we give them a trial we need Perry Mason it\\'s crazy folks it\\'s crazy and then they say and the war would help because there would not help the world would stop it okay the world would stop I mean when you have 15,000 people marching up and you have hundreds and hundreds of people and you have two or three border security people that are brave and great and don\\'t forget we don\\'t let them and we can\\'t let them use weapons we can\\'t other country can\\'t I would never do that but how do you stop these people you can\\'t that\\'s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that state only in the panhead so it\\'s a tough situation but if they change the loopholes we\\'ll have it perfectly and when the wall is finished it\\'s going to be great Democrats even supported deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets that protected Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not criminal alien Congress must act to fix our horrible immigration laws we must end catch-and-release stop human smugglers have you seen what\\'s happening human smugglers human traffickers have you seen what they\\'re doing this is an ancient thing it\\'s an ancient crime it\\'s bigger now because of the computer because of the internet than ever before worldwide not just your worldwide and most come through our southern border where we don\\'t have a wall they don\\'t go through ports of entry yet people looking inside the car the van so you can\\'t do that if you have women tied up with tape over their mouths you can\\'t take them through a port of entry and a lot of these people say oh they come through the port they don\\'t come through the port they come through areas where you don\\'t have the wall 15 miles up and make a left we got to shut down sanctuary cities to port criminal aliens and replace the visa lotteries to chain migration with a modern system of immigration we have to do one issue after issue the Democrat Party has never been further outside the American mansion has never been I\\'ve never heard of anything like what\\'s going on I want to run so badly I want this race to start immediately now Democrats are pushing a one hundred trillion dollar takeover of the US economy known as the green New Deal [Applause] that was written up by real genius the new Democrat Party believes in socialism take a look at Venezuela Republicans believe in freedom we need to get senators elected we need to get the votes we need congressmen and women elected Republicans we need to get the votes you got to get out there you gotta win otherwise we\\'ll be playing around and Democrats are aggressively pushing late term abortion allowing children to be ripped from their mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth and then you have this governor in Virginia you saw that the baby is born and you wrap the baby beautifully and you talk to the mother about the possible execution of the baby can\\'t do that so who heard of that one and that came up and that\\'s now something and they don\\'t even want to discuss it they don\\'t even want to discuss it and to protect innocent life I called on Congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting extreme late term abortion Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion witch hunts and delusions the Republican Party is the party for all Americans we want to make America great again that\\'s what we\\'re doing [Applause] I wish the cameras will you please show these people I go home you know you hear it you hear it you can hear how many people but they never show it they don\\'t want to do it it\\'s like a Florida or Florida State football game is that we are the party of the American worker the American family and we are the party of the American dream everyday we\\'re making very very good on our motto in fact much better than we promised and you know what it is its promises made promises can we\\'ve actually given you more promises and a couple of my opponents said this they weren\\'t happy about it but we\\'ve given you more promises than we said we would do that\\'s very unusual for a politician that maybe at first earlier this year I signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campuses you see and we are carefully monitoring the actions of social media giants big tech must not censor conservative or other voices and we are also taking steps to address judicial overreach activist judges whose issue that\\'s right you know about that right we did a big thing and the Democrats hate that I did this because you know we started this in Reverse was Bill Clinton when he was president because activist judges who issue nationwide injunctions based on their personal beliefs undermine democracy and threaten the rule of law take a look at what we did for criminal justice reform nobody thought it could be done and we passed it and it\\'s tough as hell but it\\'s also fair it\\'s fair that\\'s why we\\'re appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written we just confirmed listen to this our 100th federal judge and will soon be in record territory not to mention two great Supreme Court judges we\\'ve got two great Supreme Court justices what a difference and having them up there makes you feel good about your country doesn\\'t it makes you feel good about your country we\\'ve launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs we\\'re doing big last year prescription drug prices went down for the first time in nearly 51 years just today we announced that the drug companies will now be required by law to include prices in television advertisements first time it\\'s gonna drive the price and we\\'re vastly expanding affordable alternatives to Obamacare before we terminate it and replace it with something good once we take over the House the Senate the presidency together and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always the Republican Party will always protect patients with pre-existing condition people with pre-existing conditions and for the veterans we passed VA choice right so now if they wait in line for two weeks three weeks ten days four days two months people that weren\\'t even very sick a terminally ill before they get to see a doctor they immediately go outside find a good local doctor get themselves fixed up and we paid the bill and it\\'s a great thing for our veterans they\\'ve been trying to get it passed for 44 years we got it bad and we also passed 46 years they\\'ve been trying VA accountability because under the VA you could buddy if they were terrible to our great vets they could be sadistic they could steal they could rob they could do anything we had no way of firing these people now we pass VA accountability they don\\'t treat our vets right boom you\\'re fired 46 years they tried to get that little hard-working I mean in that case was against the unions and against civil service not too easy we\\'re unlocking American energy the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world [Applause] we\\'re slashing permitting delays for vital infrastructure projects we had highways that would take 21 and 22 years to get approved we brought it way down we\\'re trying to make it one year we\\'re close to getting that we\\'re down to two or three at the most this was thinking 21 there was a certain Road in a certain state they were working on it for 21 years it costs hundreds of times more money it used to be a straight line now it\\'s a line like this if you had a couple of drinks you had a very bad shot of making it home cost a fortune 21 years now we\\'re trying to get it down to one year and maybe it gets rejected for environmental reasons that\\'s okay but you have people that worked on projects almost for their entire life and then they go to a vote of some council and they lose three to two now you may get rejected but it\\'s going to take a year year and a half but mostly you\\'re not gonna get rejected it\\'s going to be done in a really good way so we\\'re trying to get that permitting process down for roads for highways for bridges for tunnels for everything there\\'s no reason it should be taking 20 years and as promised we\\'ve directed more than a half a billion dollars to fix Lake Okeechobee uber died everybody wanted that done your governor both your governor\\'s your last governor and your current governor wanted that done so we have the Army Corps of Engineers and doing a fantasy on it\\'ll now be completed in three years way out of schedule years at us guy and I was out there eight weeks ago and it was incredible and earlier this year I signed legislation providing 100 million dollars to fight the red tide that harms coastal regions especially in Florida the red tide doesn\\'t look too inviting I come down to the floor they say what the hell is that the red tide so we\\'re gonna get rid of it and to keep America safe we\\'re rebuilding America\\'s military might like never before including 133 million dollars for the Gulf Coast test range you know that is Gulf to anybody there anybody like practice shooting trust me it\\'s a good thing for you folks you don\\'t have to shoot it\\'s a good thing 133 million the military needs it so badly and it\\'s going to be very quickly completed and many other enhancements of the great state of Florida to help our wonderful warriors who are doing such an incredible job as an example at Eglin Air Force Base great people and we\\'ve made a decisive break from the failed foreign policy establishment that sacrificed our sovereignty surrendered our jobs and tied us down to endless Foreign Wars I don\\'t know if you saw but about eight weeks ago we took a hundred percent of the Caliphate it was supposed to take two years in Syria Isis that doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re not gonna go around these people are stone cold crazy and it doesn\\'t mean they don\\'t go around blowing up a store and blowing up stuff they are just nuts but we took a hundred percent and when I took over this helm this great country we were way behind you had to see I showed the map it was all so much Isis and within a short period of time we wiped it out the Caliphate but still so it\\'s a mental condition these people are sick they\\'re crazy they\\'re crazy so always keep your eyes open be careful and let law enforcement go when you see a cook let them know because we have the greatest law enforcement on earth and everything we do we are now putting America first four years we lost in so many different ways we were losing on trade we were getting beaten by people and countries that had no chance we were insisting that no NATO members you had to see this the NATO folks they don\\'t pay their fair share that was supposed to pay we were taking over and spending almost a hundred percent of our money to protect the countries in NATO which is Europe and I said that\\'s not right on top of that the EU absolutely kills us our traits all changing folks 100 billion dollars extra was just given by those countries that\\'s now pouring into NATO because I said you got to pay up your past presidents would go and meet them and wouldn\\'t talk about it well that\\'s a gia whenever you get a chance maybe you could pay up you got to see it was like a chart this way now it\\'s a chart like a rocket ship the other one they\\'re paying up 100 billion dollars they paid 100 billion with a B last month I announced that my administration is unsigned the UN arms trade treaty which is great for your second we love our second coming and we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on that very precious Second Amendment and your rights under the Second Amendment I also withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal and unfortunately just today I felt compelled to authorize new sanctions on Iran\\'s iron steel aluminum and copper industries because I hope to be able at some point maybe it won\\'t happen possibly won\\'t to sit down and work out a fair deal we\\'re not looking to hurt anybody we want a fair deal we just don\\'t want them to have nuclear weapons that\\'s all we want I recognized Israel\\'s capital and opened the American [Applause] and just two weeks ago I announced that the United States would recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights that\\'s a big deal and as rockets rain down on Israel we reaffirmed America\\'s solidarity with the citizens of Israel in their fight against terror they have done just a great job it\\'s a dangerous place the Middle East is a dangerous place we also recognize the general government of Venezuela and we forcefully condemned the socialist brutality of the Maduro regime and our hearts are united with the people of Venezuela and many of their relatives who are here right now with us tonight the people of Cuba and the people of Nicaragua in their struggle to be free it will all happen folks they\\'ll all happen each of us and this great arena sort of a ray that doesn\\'t have a roof but these are minor detail problem is if we had a roof you could never hold as many people we\\'re all united by the same timeless values we believe in the American constant we believe in strong borders strong families and a strong national defense we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life we believe in religious liberty the right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms we believe that mothers and fathers not government regulators know best how to raise our children and teach our great countries values and we believe in the words of our national motto In God We Trust these are the traditions customs and principles that bind us together as neighbors as citizens as Americans these are the values that unite people in the Panhandle we love the Panhandle you all love the pan hands I think so you\\'re incredible people I tell you you\\'re incredible people you\\'re smart you\\'re loyal you\\'re unbelievable people but all across the magnificent state of Florida and all over our country you joined our movement because you rejected the failures and betrayals of past politicians you stared down a corrupt system that enriched itself at your expense the system is rigged I used to say it it\\'s still rigged but a lot less rigged we\\'re getting rid of a lot of the rigging rapidly folks you reclaimed your destiny you defended your dignity and you took back to your country you have always been loyal to this nation now you finally have a president who is loyal to you [Applause] thank you and every day between now and November 3rd to 20 I think of that November 3rd 2020 boy it\\'s closer but every day we\\'re going to keep on working we\\'re going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning remember I used to tell the story that your governor would come to see me and you\\'d be winning so much in the state of Florida Governor Ron he\\'d say president please in the Oval Office please were winning too much we\\'re not used to this mr. president we\\'re not used to this for years and years we\\'ve been losers we\\'ve been losing mr. friends that we\\'re winning we\\'re winning so much the people of Florida kids did winning so much can you maybe pull it back a little bit mr. president no I can\\'t I\\'m sorry he said I thought you\\'d say that we\\'re gonna keep winning we\\'ve never been winning like we\\'re winning now you\\'ve never had better numbers you\\'ve never had I think more loyalty you look at what\\'s happening to this

Minnesota [Music] the Tennessee [Applause] Detroit down do you stand [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you very much hello Pennsylvania Pennsylvania well I\\'m thrilled to be back in this state that gave us American independence you know that American steel which we now have coming back by the way like never before and generations of American patriots thank you very much thank you thank you this is an incredible time for our country the unemployment rate in Pennsylvania has just reached an all-time historic low that\\'s a pretty good stat how do you beat that somebody\\'s going to come and run and they\\'re gonna say they\\'re gonna do good in the history of this country you just hit an all-time low that\\'s pretty tough to be we\\'ve ended the last administration\\'s eight-year war on Pennsylvania energy and we\\'re unleashing clean coal and shale and America is now their number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world man this is a lot of people [Applause] I think next time we\\'ll just have to get a bigger hangar that\\'s a big hangar looking at [Applause] thank you thank you thank you very much and I thought that was the Sun in my eyes it\\'s these stupid lights these people I mean what do we what are they doing it\\'s really way that can turn those lights down folks crazy you\\'ve got a thing called the Sun we like the Sun better than the artificial matzoh wages are going way up crime is going way down and our military is more powerful right now than ever before and when we took over two and a half years ago our military was in big trouble it was depleted you know that it was depleted the equipment was old the planes were all we have the most beautiful fighter jets in the world being delivered now every day every day our spirit is strong our stride is back and our stand is clear we are finally putting like I said America first and after years of building up foreign countries we are now building up our country about time we\\'ve got the hottest economy anywhere in the world the United States added two hundred and sixty three thousand jobs just last month far exceeding any expectations and since the election we\\'ve created nearly six million new jobs now if I would have ever said that to the fake news media look at how many back there that\\'s a lot of people that\\'s a lot of people looks like the Academy Awards used to look before they decided to go political against us now the Academy Awards is you know but that includes a half a million brand new manufacturing jobs which the previous administration said will never happen will never happen and it wouldn\\'t have happened if you had them or the like right here in Pennsylvania we\\'ve added a hundred and fifty five thousand new jobs including twenty thousand new construction jobs nobody thought that was possible and more than five million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps we\\'re getting Americans off welfare and back into the workforce and it\\'s happening by the thousands and thousands and thousands 1 million people have been lifted out of poverty and the poverty rate for African Americans has reached the lowest level ever recorded the Hispanic American African American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached an all-time historic low those debates should be very easy when we meet whoever we\\'re going to meet because statistically I mean maybe I don\\'t know who knows politics is a crazy world but when you have the best employment numbers in history when you have the best unemployment numbers

the polls the fake polls that they put out suppression they call them suppression Falls Pennsylvania will go to Hillary Clinton unfortunately for them didn\\'t work out that [Applause] so but do you remember that night they wouldn\\'t announce Pennsylvania there was 1% left if I lost every single vote I would win they wouldn\\'t do it it gets later and later and then they announce Michigan we won Wisconsin we won and then they finally announced we won the great state of Pennsylvania [Music] [Applause] they had a hard time with that worry but we have a big race tomorrow you got to go raise your right hand you all promise I\\'m going to go out and vote and you know you\\'re voting for so we have a great gentleman very successful businessman the 12th congressional district the Democrat running for the seat is a radical socialist the Democrat candidate wants to open your borders and whip fighting like hell with the worst laws to get those borders closed the wall is being built as we speak we\\'ll have almost 500 miles of wall by the end of next year it\\'s terrible [Applause] [Applause] can you get him up here get him up here come on this guy [Applause] now we know who he\\'s voting for thank you very much he said I\\'m from San Diego do you believe that he said I\\'m from San Diego and we need that wall and you know in San Diego as you know it\\'s going up and now it\\'s up and here\\'s what they did in California they wanted the walls so badly and so I did it and I said you know maybe I shouldn\\'t do it politically let them ask I did it and now it\\'s beautiful people not coming in it\\'s beautiful in serrate in San Diego and now they go out and say we didn\\'t want the wall in the first place they didn\\'t they wanted the wall desperately because they were being flooded with illegal immigrants is that right flooded now they don\\'t have that but now they find that it\\'s a terrible situation we\\'re in but that\\'s okay because we always win somehow we always find a way to win it would be awfully good if we sat down for 15 minutes we could stop up that border so perfectly the laws and the judges are so against us it\\'s actually incredible but we\\'re gonna win and we\\'re winning now but it\\'s it shouldn\\'t be hard it should be really easy we raise you know that you know the word raise taxes does anybody like it they want to raise your taxes they go out and say we as Democrats want to raise your taxes they want to shut down your American energy they think these are good things they want to destroy your Second Amendment no more second than me the Republican candidate somebody who is absolutely a winner somebody that I didn\\'t want to take a chance you know normally I can\\'t do other things tonight I like you I love this state I figured hey it\\'s a Monday we have an election tomorrow who the hell wants to sit around doing nothing on Monday night right and by the way the first lady sends her regards she campaigned here on our last day just before the election but we have a man who\\'s a special man he\\'s a successful businessman an owner he believes in protecting the border defending our Second Amendment he\\'s not letting anything happen to your Second Amendment and you know what if we aren\\'t smart it\\'ll end for you with the Second Amendment it\\'ll end for you and so many other things your taxes will go up you know they\\'re talking about 7075 percent right you know what we have it down too and we got the business tax down to 21% from essentially over 40% Fred Keller is a tough man he\\'s tough on crime he loves our military loves our police he loves our vets and he will always protect patients and he will always go for like me and I say it so strongly because the fake news doesn\\'t want to say it we will always protect pre-existing conditions very important and by the way we got rid of the individual mandate the worst part of Obamacare and we almost had it repealed and replaced but we had one man that after campaigning for eight years he decided to go thumbs down at two o\\'clock in the morning that\\'s all right but we\\'ll end up we\\'ll end up with even better because we have plans that are even better than that so that\\'s good sometimes when you have adversity it works out actually better but I want Fred to please come on up you have to get out tomorrow Fred Keller 12th district he\\'s gonna be a great congressman Fred [Applause] mr. president welcome to central Pennsylvania thank you for coming tonight to show your support for the hard-working people of Pennsylvania\\'s 12th

get out tomorrow and vote to send me to Congress thank you god bless you god bless our president and god bless the United States of America [Music] Thank You Fred go get him Fred so get out tomorrow it\\'s a little bit of a referendum you know a lot of people are watching this race I don\\'t know if there are other races or not who the hell cares we have Fred we have to get Fred in there tomorrow if he wins they won\\'t report it if he loses it\\'ll be the greatest story in the history of our country they will make that into and we don\\'t want that they will make that into the single greatest event that our country has ever seen I\\'ve had it before where somebody comes you know when we campaign for people they win and a lot of cases Andy Barr in Kentucky and I\\'m not just also you know we also won the Senate you wouldn\\'t believe that if you read we won the Senate we picked up two additional seats remember they were going to win this in it but I campaigned I made 32 major stops in a short period of time do you think that\\'s easy and then I had to make two more on the final day of a runoff Cindy hyde-smith she won she did great she did great but that was that was a lot of work and we won the Senate we got no praise we got no a Clemente we got nothing but you know what tomorrow Fred is a lot of lot of people are watching a lot of those fakers back there or watching and they\\'re gonna they\\'re gonna be reporting very positively I\\'m sure if he wins but gotta have sure you got to make sure he wins please you know what they\\'ll say President Trump came to Pennsylvania and he went back home a loser I never want to be called elusive remember this we all together we I we ran one time and we\\'ll want to know but it was for the big one now we\\'re gonna have a second time we\\'re gonna have another one and then we\\'ll drive them crazy let ready and maybe if we really like it a lot and if things keep going like they\\'re going we\\'ll go and we\\'ll do what we have to do we\\'ll do a three and a four and a five but they\\'ll have tomorrow we knew he yeah I don\\'t want to say now we\\'re gonna have another one and it\\'s gonna be great and you know one of the things we\\'re talking about the greatest probably I think political slogan of all time is what you haven\\'t yet make America great again but now our military is so powerful we\\'re taking on countries in trade that the Democrats and Republicans didn\\'t do anything about no fairness for years and years China and so many other countries I don\\'t want to embarrass cuz frankly a lot of my great people but they don\\'t understand how they got away with it either but we have to make a decision soon do we keep our logo do we keep our slogan make America great again or it\\'s very risky changing the most successful slogan has to be they think that was one of the greatest elections of all time and now we\\'re taking the slogan or the logo from that election and possibly changing it but we\\'ve had a hundred and one or a hundred and two all-time high stock markets record stock markets we have just about the best unemployment in history including the absolute best for african-american Asian as you know an Hispanic so we have all of these records that we\\'ve been setting our military strong our Second Amendment is good everything\\'s good so do we make it make America great again and we\\'re going to go with cheers here one way or the other or do we make it keep America great you have son of look you know this you have some of these socialist wackos they want to double and triple your taxes and that won\\'t come close to paying for they want to knock down all buildings in Manhattan and rebuild them without windows you know about that let\\'s rebuild up glass is no good we don\\'t want windows I used to love the view but I think we\\'ll all be forced to close up windows no it\\'s crazy what they\\'re saying so many different things so do we want Keep America great or make America great again we\\'ll go Keep America great first ready so keep America great or make America first Keep America gray now it\\'s very hard to leave something that was so successful I\\'ve had people say even though it\\'s not spot-on because in theory we\\'ve made America great again we certainly will by the time of the election but you look at the numbers but it\\'s so good it\\'s very hard to take a expression and say let\\'s change it so let me have it for make America great again so now we go ready Keep America great [Applause] ready make America great again whoa Wow well I like it because they\\'ll sell many many more hats that way we\\'ll keep the Hat the same color though right you understand what I\\'m saying though about right Keep America great-looking I\\'ve had that response from others it\\'s amazing I like to do polls that are cheap I hate to say it this is the cheap poll but it\\'s better than any poll you could get the embassy they go out in the interview like a hundred and three people I got thousands here tonight well I think we\\'ll have to consider that then but either way it\\'s gonna be great we\\'re gonna have a great campaign we have a great country and we have in fact made America great again we brought it back we brought it back and I\\'ll tell you our country is respected again all you have to do is speak to the folks in China in Japan speak to the folks no matter where you go the European nations you speak to them you go European Union as an example they\\'ve badly mistreated us for many years but they sound good I say the biggest are they\\'re all European Union we need a doctor please a doctor please do we have a doctor doctor in the house please thank you doctor thank you take your time some of these people in the front row they\\'ve been here for two days and I don\\'t I don\\'t blame him right I don\\'t blame them they\\'ve been waiting in line for two days and stuff thank you fellas

I\\'m in love [Applause] thank you thank you very much and thank you thank you thank you for taking doctor thank you for such a good job thank you very much under my administration we\\'re reversing years of failed trade policies that crushed Pennsylvania\\'s middle class you know that better than anybody you know it better than anybody what they did to Pennsylvania in particular Ohio Pennsylvania some of the states in particular frankly North Carolina what they did was disgraceful what they did to the workers they took out your businesses they moved them to other countries they sold back the product with no taxes nothing you lost your jobs we lost revenue and nobody even apologized except me I said we\\'re going to turn it around and that\\'s what we\\'ve done now we have companies are pouring back into our country they want to be where the action is they\\'re pouring back including the auto company in the 8 years before my election the United States lost a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs but the great betrayal of the American worker ended on day one the day I took office and you know that better than anyone the Forgotten men and women of America will never ever be forgotten again it\\'s not gonna happen and they\\'re looking for you they\\'re trying to figure out who the hell were all these people where did they come from remember the deplorable deplorable you know I watched your speech well she actually said I thought worse she said deplorable and didn\\'t you say irredeemable x\\' to show you how good I am politically I said oh that\\'s a killer the word irredeemable is - well it turned out to be deplorable was the word that caught on right I would say irredeemable is worse than deplorable what do you think but they believe in both and not only her it\\'s the Democrats upon my inauguration I inherited one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated it was ready to be put into action the trans-pacific partnership it would have destroyed the state of Pennsylvania the TPP was a gift for the lobbyists and the donors and the special interests and the foreign countries that have made a fortune hurting the American worker the TPP would have been a catastrophe for the people of Scranton and Allentown and Pittsburgh in my first week I proudly withdrew the United States from further negotiations on that job-killing disaster which by the way would have destroyed our auto business would have destroyed it just like NAFTA just like NAFTA was such a disaster this would have been worse it\\'s no wonder that when Joe Biden announced he\\'s running for president by the way by the way we have thousands of people so and this is it I\\'m not even announcing today we\\'ll wait for a couple of weeks okay this is just we\\'re going for Fred look at the thousands and thousands of people we have now they said he had 600 people now now very good very good I\\'d say 150 and that was doing an announcement right I\\'d say 150 people but he announced he\\'s running for president and he said it\\'s because foreign leaders called him up and begged him to do it absolutely foreign countries liked it much better that\\'s what they want they want Biden so that China can continue to make five hundred billion dollars a year and more ripping off the United States they like it you look at what these countries have made we lost on just trade 800 billion dollars on average for many years 800 billion not million 800 millions a lot 800 billion it\\'s not even conceivable and we didn\\'t do anything about it and I mean not only President Obama I mean others too it\\'s a shame but we\\'re straightening it out it\\'s not easy it\\'s not easy because we have a lot of assaults from within but we\\'re straightening it out and it\\'s getting done and you see what\\'s going with China we\\'re taking in we will soon be taken in over a hundred billion dollars in tariffs so remember this they subsidize their product people are moving from China now to go to areas that aren\\'t tariff we\\'re going to build places in Pennsylvania and others rather than order it like the old days remember the old days we actually made our own product okay we made our own very expensive for China they\\'re not happy but that\\'s okay it\\'ll all work out foreign countries liked it much better when they could push us around rip us off and make us pay for the privilege of handing over our jobs and handing over our wealth eight long years ago if you remember I said it\\'s really bad we\\'re never going back the previous administration what they did to our country they should be ashamed of themselves sleepy joe said that he\\'s running to quote saved the world well he was he\\'s gonna save every country but ours and remember he said a week ago China\\'s not a competitor China\\'s Nautica but you know hey look what they\\'ve done to us is indescribable economically we have rebuilt China they\\'ve done a great job and I don\\'t blame China I don\\'t blame President Xi I don\\'t blame them look we allowed it to happen our leaders allowed it to happen well it\\'s not happening anymore Iran and we have saved America we made America great again and we\\'re gonna keep America great that\\'s what it is and if you don\\'t mind we\\'re gonna take a little bit of money out of the hundred billion dollars that we\\'re saving we\\'re gonna take a little bit of money okay doctor get the same doctor get the same doctor he was great are you okay okay we\\'ll be okay go ahead take your time [Music] take your time I love these people [Music] [Music] take your time [Music] we\\'ll be okay they say come on let\\'s go make sure she\\'s okay make sure Thank You time now the truth is there\\'s a lot of excitement that these rallies and they wait a long time and people are excited how exciting good a lot of excitement a lot of energy we have a lot of low-energy people out there that we\\'re competing against Low Energy but vicious they\\'re vicious but they\\'re lower thank you [Music] yeah no more spying on Trump I think they learned that didn\\'t work out too well [Music] [Music] he did a good job he did a good job where is where is Don Jr Don [Applause] they like the job you did [Applause] okay thank you thank you very much great job thank you so the very same establishment that sacrificed our prosperity weakened our military and tied us down through endless wars that never ended folks they never ended you saw what we did with the Caliphate now you have to understand these people are stone-cold crazy so you never say you won because then they blow up a store they hurt and kill people they\\'re totally crazy but we beat and took a hundred percent of the Caliphate the area the land took a hundred percent and did it very rapidly very rapidly hope we want to start bringing our people back home we win and bring him back home and now they\\'re asking us to repeat history and relive the same failures all over again the failures they brought you like you wouldn\\'t believe and we\\'re never going to let it happen one of the worst fiestas from our former leaders was the disaster of NAFTA all buildings in Pennsylvania in New England all over they were a total they\\'re empty and even to this day some were converted to nursing homes some were taken over but you still see the shock of what they went down and now we\\'re replacing them with brand-new beautiful buildings we\\'ve got it up we\\'ve got it working again all over the country we\\'re building plants and factories like actually forever before nearly two decades ago the same politicians who gave us NAFTA also voted to admit China into the World Trade Organization a disastrous really decision I mean that was a disastrous decision since then we\\'ve lost 60,000 nut jobs listen to this 60,000 factories here\\'s the good news we\\'re building them all back they\\'re coming back you know I used to give that because it was really two years ago so many have come back but I used to give that number and I used to say it\\'s got to be a mistake you can\\'t lose 60,000 factories and when the fake dues didn\\'t correct me I knew that I was correct because if I was off by one factory they would have said he made a mistake past leaders let China freely plunder the United States economy and take the crown jewels of American industry now we are finally responding to years of chronic trade abuses by defending our workers with tariffs and anything else that\\'s necessary because nobody\\'s going to steal our businesses nobody\\'s gonna close our factories and nobody\\'s going to close our plants any more they\\'re all coming back and anyone who doesn\\'t want to pay the tariffs as the simple solution build your product in America bring your factories back to Pennsylvania where you want to be anyway you never wanted to leave in the first place stupid policy and taxes forced you out under this administration we\\'re living by two simple rules by American and hire American rights to protect our national security we also impose a 10% tariff on foreign aluminum and a 25% tariff on foreign steel and what that\\'s done for your aluminum and steel in this country is incredible now just this month United States Steel announced that it will invest more than 1 billion dollars to completely transform and make new the manhua you know that you know where this is right next to Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh does anyone know Mon Valley works near Pittsburgh they\\'re spending over a billion dollars thousands of jobs the newest the finest equipment in the world they\\'re going to make steel again in our country they haven\\'t been building new plants for decades together we\\'re putting Pennsylvania steel back into the spine of America and as we defend our jobs we\\'re also defending our borders and it\\'s tough as I said no betrayal of American workers has been worse than the Democrat party\\'s pursuit of open borders they want everybody to come in and they\\'re coming up by the thousands and I\\'ll tell you what our Border Patrol our law enforcement ice they are working they\\'re apprehending 30 40 50 thousand people at times I mean just in short periods of times the laws are so bad if you don\\'t release them they arrest you they arrest people that are working in law enforcement it\\'s a disgrace Democrat backed policies have left our borders overrun our detention facilities overwhelmed as fast as we build them they fill up and our hospital schools and public resources overburdened our country is full we don\\'t want people coming up here our country is full we want Mexico to stop we want all of our country is packed to the gills we don\\'t want them coming up [Applause] Democrats claim to take care of the poor that\\'s what they want to do it\\'s not happening that way the poor of being hurt the middle-income of being hurt we would lose our businesses we would lose everything if we go with the people that you see that are running for office you saw that last night I watched Alfred E Neuman what\\'s going on with Fox by the way what\\'s going on there and putting more Democrats on then you have Republicans it\\'s something strange is going on at Fox well something very strange did you see this guy last night I did want to watch that you always have to watch the competition if you call it that and he was knocking the hell out of Fox and Fox\\'s put him if somebody\\'s gonna have to explain the whole Fox deal to me Democrats even want to give welfare and free health care to anyone who crosses our border they want free health care free education free anything Republicans believe we should take care of our own people our citizens we have no choice that\\'s why we don\\'t want them to come and that\\'s why my administration has published a new rule to ensure our limited supply of public housing is safeguarded for low-income Americans not for illegal aliens who are fighting to get it will soon be taking further action to ensure that federal benefits are preserved for hardworking citizens who need them the most we\\'re also outlining historic pro-american immigration reform it\\'s working its way through I must tell you some of it\\'s not going to happen unless you vote for Republicans in the upcoming election and I will tell you it\\'s not very far away and you\\'re gonna have great immigration laws people that no idea how bad they were to remember even three or four weeks ago they would say there\\'s no emergency at the border this number now everybody is admitting I agree this an emergency I\\'ve been saying that for two years the choice is simple Republican policies protect us workers Democrat policies protect smugglers traffickers and even criminal aliens and drug dealers like you\\'ve never seen the drugs we\\'re capturing them we don\\'t let them go we capture them and we do it very very sadly it\\'s almost like routine but you have drug dealers coming into our country and making our people sick and we\\'re capturing them at just one example the sanctuary city of Philadelphia released a previously deported and from prison rather than cooperate with federal authorities after his release that criminal alien raped a very young child Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans not for criminal aliens and we always stand with the heroes of ice and Border Patrol and law enforcement our police have been incredible and we want to thank them too because I\\'ll tell you even tonight I see their way the way they\\'re working and I hope the cameras get to see this crowd you know usually they\\'ll show like four people behind me people will say what is it a large crowd I said well you could tell by them they can actually tell by the cheering you know sounds like a [Music] they don\\'t like to show the crowd explain that to me and I\\'m trying to tell them it\\'s really good for television to show the crowd don\\'t you show they show like this there\\'s three or four people behind me that will be very famous tomorrow but they have lousy seats tonight so I think you\\'re better on the issue of the Democrat Party it\\'s never been further outside from the mainstream than it is now these people have gone nuts more than 120 Democrats in Congress have signed up for Bernie Sanders total government takeover of health care now tell me many of you have phenomenal health care yet private health care 180 million people they want to take it away from you they want to take away your health care your health insurance they want to take it away Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion killing you Second Amendment and radical socialism the Republican Party is the party that America wants that\\'s what America wants we\\'re the party of the American worker with the party of the American family and with the party of the American Dream every day we make good on our motto promises made promises kept we\\'ve kept more promises than we\\'ve even made you take a look at what we\\'ve done between regulations and taxes and I mean think of it right to try you know what right to try is I won\\'t go into it you don\\'t want to be there but now we can give them the benefit of the great research we have the best in the world and there\\'s a lot of great things happening I signed that eight months ago a lot of great things happening with write to try we passed the largest package of tax cuts in the history of our country we eliminated 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register and that\\'s an all-time record and I would view the United States I thought I\\'d be hit hard on this one and I wasn\\'t just asked how are they doing in Paris from the past administration\\'s job killing Paris climate Accord which would have cost a fortune and would have hurt our country horribly we will never allow foreign bureaucrats and countries to trample on our sovereignty or to shut down our jobs which is what that would have done yet every Democrat running for president wants to reopen the economic assault on Pennsylvania by crippling the call and jail industries and by crippling your now once again great steel industry your steel industry is great so if you want American energy you have to go Republican if you want a great country you have to vote Republican we\\'ve appointed more than 100 federal judges already soon to be a record to apply the law as written including well you know this two great Supreme Court justices neo corsets and Brett Kavanaugh too justice they\\'re great we\\'ve launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and last year for the first time in 51 years drug prices went down first time in 51 years but we\\'re going to bring it away that and we passed VA choice and VA accountability to give our veterans that care that they deserve and they\\'ve been trying to pass these things for 45 years we\\'ve made a record-setting investment of the United States military including more than 70 million dollars to build submarine propellers at the naval shipyard at a place called Philadelphia and to protect America\\'s security I would through the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal [Applause] dr. doctor thank you doctor thank you doctor take your time again we have all night right [Applause] I don\\'t know what this does to television but that\\'s okay how is she doing okay thank you time [Music] take your time doctor [Music] [Applause] [Music] are those lights bright enough I think that\\'s why people are going down these crazy lights and they look like they cost a fortune to I don\\'t know I don\\'t know who I don\\'t know who got those lights but they\\'re very bright a real genius got those lights [Music] how\\'s it going doc good good good he\\'s good we take care of our people we have great people and I recognize Israel\\'s capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and just a few weeks ago the United States acknowledged Israel\\'s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we stand with the people of Venezuela Cuba and Nicaragua in their righteous struggle to be free so each of us here tonight is united by the same timeless values we support the rule of law and the incredible men and women of law enforcement thank you all we protect cherish and defend the Constitution of the United States we reject the ideology

him they were spying they were spying on our campaign I\\'ll tell you what if that ever happened to the other side this thing would have been over two years ago and you know it would have been treason they would have called it treason and that\\'s what it is it was treason and it should never be allowed to happen to another president again ever ever ever you reclaimed your destiny you defended your dignity and you took back to your country [Applause] [Applause] well we have a great new Attorney General who\\'s going to give it a very fair look very fair you\\'ve always been loyal to this station

our path even though we had phony Russian hoaxes and witch hunts and people that hate Trump and hate you angry Democrats all after us with all of it and they still have it\\'s like little embers that

American people in such a short time he truly loves this country and will continue to work on your behalf as long as he can\\'t all of us will thank you all again for being here tonight and now I want to introduce my husband the President of the United States [Applause] [Music] we had such luck in Orlando we love being in Orlando Thank you Thank You Orlando what a turnout you know I says this is a very big arena for a Tuesday night I said you know if we have about three or four empty seats the fake news will say headlines he didn\\'t fill out Fiorina [Applause] so I said maybe we shouldn\\'t take a chance maybe we shouldn\\'t go to Orlando we should go someplace else I said no I think we\\'ll go to Orlando [Music] not only did we fill it up but we had a hundred and twenty thousand requests that means come out very very good congratulations I want to thank our great vice president Mike Pence his wonderful wife Karen pence and our magnificent First Lady Melania thank you I\\'m thrilled to be back in my second home that\\'s what it is it\\'s my second home in many cases I think I could say it\\'s my first storm you want to know that it\\'s the great state of Florida very historic because exactly four years ago this week I announced my campaign for President of the United States and it turned out to be more than just a political campaign it turns out to be a great political movement because of you it\\'s a movement made up of hard-working Patriots who love their country love their flag love their children and who believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first together we stare down a corrupt and broken political establishment and we restored government of by and for the people our country is now thriving prospering and booming and frankly it\\'s soaring to incredible new heights our economy is the envy of the world perhaps the greatest economy we\\'ve had in the history of our country and as long as you keep your steam in place we have a tremendous way to go our future has never ever looked brighter or sharper the fact is the American Dream is back it\\'s bigger and better and stronger than ever before 20:16 was not merely another four-year election this was a defining moment in American history ask them right there [Applause] [Applause] by the way that is a lot of fake news back there that\\'s [Applause] you know what I say the amount of press we have tonight reminds me of the Academy Awards before it went political and their ratings went down the tubes this was our chance to reclaim our government from a permanent political class that enriched itself at your expense as I said or a wonderful beautiful day at my inauguration we did not merely transfer power from one party to another but we transferred power back to you the proud citizens of the United States of America we stared down the unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests who made a living bleeding our country dry that\\'s what we\\'ve done we broke down the doors of Washington back rooms where deals were cut to close our companies give away your jobs shut down our factories and surrender your sovereignty and your very way of life and we\\'ve ended it we took on a political machine that tried to take away your voice in your vote they tried to take away your dignity and your destiny but we will never let them do that will we many times I said we would drain the swamp and that\\'s exactly what we\\'re doing right now we\\'re draining the swamp [Applause] and that\\'s why the swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently for the last two and a half years we have been under siege and with the Muller report we won and now they want a do-over they want to do over let\\'s do it again didn\\'t work out too well let\\'s do it again they want to do over no president should ever have to go through this again it is so bad for our great country a hoax the great hoax our patriotic movement has been under assault from the very first day we accomplished more than any other president has in the first two and a half years of a presidency and under circumstances that no president has had to deal with before because we did in the middle of the great and illegal witch hunt things that nobody have been able to accomplish not even close nobody\\'s done what we have done in two and a half years we went through the greatest witch hunt in political history the only collusion was committed by the Democrats the fake news media and their operatives and the people who funded the phony dossier from kid Hillary Clinton and the DNC [Applause] it was all an illegal attempt to overturn the results of the election spy on our campaign which is what they did and subvert our democracy remember the insurance policy just in case Hillary Clinton lost remember the insurance policy [Applause] they appointed 18 very angry Democrats to try to take down our incredible movement after two years 1.4 million pages of documents 500 search warrants 500 witnesses 2,800 subpoenas and 40 FBI agents working round-the-clock what did they come up with no collusion and the facts that led our great Attorney General to determine no obstruction no collusion no obstruction and they spent 40 million dollars on this which under 40 million dollars [Applause] that\\'s right they spent forty million dollars probably a hell of a lot more than that [Applause] and think about it nobody\\'s been tougher on Russia then Donald Trump nobody we call it the Russian hoax remember President Obama\\'s famous line caught on the open mic secretly telling the Russian president to quote inform Vladimir that after my election I\\'ll have more flexibility okay [Applause] a lot of people remember that I remember that I saw it happen I didn\\'t like it they don\\'t bring it up the fake news will never bring it up and in September just before the election the FBI told President Obama about possible Russian interference and he did nothing because he thought that Hillary Clinton crooked Hillary was going to win that\\'s why he did nothing he did nothing I built up the military imposed sanctions on Russia and provided alternative energy sources for all over Europe that competed very very strongly with Russia we are by the way the number one producer of energy in the world because of what we\\'ve done right now the Democrats don\\'t care about Russia they only care about their own political power they went after my family my business my finance it\\'s my employees almost everyone that I\\'ve ever known or worked with but they are really going after you that\\'s what it\\'s all about none about us it\\'s about you they tried to erase your vote erase your legacy of the greatest campaign and the greatest election probably in the history of our country and they wanted to deny you the future that you demanded and the future that America deserves and that now America is getting Democrat opponents are driven by hatred prejudice and rage they want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country as we know it not acceptable it\\'s not going to happen happen to understand Democrats ruthless taxes look no further than the United States Supreme Court and our court system nationwide I will soon have appointed my one hundred and forty fifth judge President Obama was very nice to us he didn\\'t fill the positions I get there the first day how many judges do I have to appoint they said sir 139 now it\\'s 145 and we\\'ve just finished number 107 already approved sitting on the bench how about that and by the time we\\'re finished with the rest we will have a record percentages our percentage will be a record except for one person one person has a higher percentage than your favorite president Donald Trump do you know who that president is he\\'s got a higher percentage than me and it\\'s devastating his name is George Washington George\\'s at 100% and there\\'s no way I\\'m gonna get there no matter what I tell you got 100% well he was first so he just appointed them all and that was it that\\'s gonna be a hard record to be they want to take away your judges they want to pack the court with far left idealize and they want to radicalize our judiciary you know that we already have a lot of fun look at what they did to a great gentleman justice Cavanaugh highly respected they didn\\'t just try to win they tried to destroy him with false and malicious accusations and Thank You Marco and Thank You Lindsay wherever you may be thank you great job thank you stand up yeah Lindsey Graham was doing okay in South Carolina in that great now he\\'s through the roof great thank you great job thank you great people great people all of them they tried to ruin the family of now justice Kevin they tried to ruin his career they tried to ruin his life they even wanted to impeach him on fraudulent charges those charges were a fraud he did nothing wrong all in pursuit of political domination and control just imagine what this angry left-wing mob would do if they were in charge of this country [Applause] imagine if we had a Democrat president and a Democrat Congress in 2020 [Applause] that would shut down your free speech use the power of the law to punish their opponents which they\\'re trying to do now anyway they\\'ll always be trying to shield themselves they would strip Americans of their constitutional rights while flooding the country with illegal immigrants in the hopes it will expand their political base and they\\'ll get votes someplace down the future that\\'s what it\\'s about [Applause] [Applause] and we are building the wall we\\'re gonna have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year it\\'s moving rapidly we\\'ll be very man you know we couldn\\'t get the wall approved by the Democrats even though they voted for it four years ago and six years ago and didn\\'t get built but they voted for all of a sudden Trump is president we don\\'t want a wall can you imagine can you imagine those care events without having the barriers and walls that we\\'ve already put up and that are up this country would be a mess like you wouldn\\'t believe so the wall is moving along it\\'s moving along rapidly it\\'s beautiful I changed the design it\\'s stronger bigger better and cheaper watch cheaper you know sometimes when they don\\'t give you the money you have to make it cheaper not going to happen but it\\'s going well instead of bringing us together as one American Democrats want to splinter us into factions and tribes they want us divided not going to happen to the Republicans anymore it\\'s not gonna happen this election is not merely a verdict on the amazing progress we\\'ve made it\\'s a verdict on the unamerican conduct of those who try to undermine our great democracy and undermine you and by the way on July 4th in Washington DC come on down we\\'re gonna have a big day bring your flags bring those swing bring those American flags July 4th we\\'re gonna have hundreds of thousands of people we\\'re going to celebrate America sounds good right July 4 celebrate America this election is a verdict on whether we want to live that a country where the people who lose an election refuse to concede and spend the next two years trying to shred our constitution and rip your country apart [Applause] you remember during one of the debates when crooked Hillary said if I win are you gonna support me but I must be honest I didn\\'t give her a great answer very that might have been my hardest question during the debates it\\'s did amazing that it worked the other way around right if you want to know how the system is rigged just compare how they came after us for three years with everything they have versus the free pass they gave to Hillary and her aides after they set up an illegal server destroyed evidence deleted an acid-wash 33,000 emails exposed classified information and turned the State Department into a pay-for-play cash machine 33,000 emails delete it think of it I keep mentioning you know there was a lot of corruptions on the other side but you know the simplest thing they get a subpoena from the United States Congress and they decide that they\\'re not going to give it so Lindsey Graham they delete and they acid-washed which is very expensive nobody does it they acid-wash those emails that would have be seen again but we may find them somewhere deeper in the State Department but can you imagine if I got a Savita [Music] think of this if I got a subpoena for emails if I deleted one email like a love note to Milania it\\'s the electric chair for trauma 33,000 emails [Applause] but let\\'s see what happens we now have a great Attorney General let\\'s see what happens so if you want to shut down this rig to system once and for all then show up November third that she\\'d a big day and vote vote vote we\\'re gonna have a big big day thank you and remember the only thing these corrupt politicians will understand is an earthquake at the ballot box that\\'s what they will understand are they\\'re going to see it we did it once and now we will do it again and this time we\\'re going to finish the job and this time should be a lot easier because we have done so much with our military with our vets with the Second Amendment with our regulations with the biggest tax cut in history with getting rid of so many different problems so many different things including by the way the individual mandate and Obamacare one of the worst things anybody\\'s ever had to live through we got rid of the individual man how many people are happy they no longer have to pay for the privilege of not paying for bed health insurance how many people are happy bad health care so every time you don\\'t have to make out a check in order not to have healthcare think of that think of that this is the only country you pay for the very distinct privilege of not having to pay but you had to pay aloud now you don\\'t have to pay anymore you don\\'t want it you don\\'t have to that was a big deal the people trying to stop our movement are the same Washington insiders who spent their careers rigging the system so your losses will be their games you know that these are the same career politicians who presided over decades of flat wages the loss of our manufacturing jobs 60,000 can you believe them 60,000 who would believe that number and you know how I know it\\'s true because if it wasn\\'t I\\'ve been using it a lot the fake news would have headlines Trump used a phony number it\\'d be the biggest story Trump you as well they never corrected it so I assume fellas 60,000 shuttered factors we closed up 60,000 factories it didn\\'t seem right it didn\\'t seem like it would be possible an avalanche of job-killing regulations a growing wealth gap and one ruinous trade deal after another by the way those trade deals are getting very good folks you will see we just completed the deal with South Korea great deal we\\'re working with Mexico and Canada we have to get the Democrats to approve it we want it to be bipartisan as you know you may have read a couple of things about China I spoke to President Xi terrific president a great leader of China spoke to him this morning at length and we\\'ll see what happens but we they\\'re going to have a good deal and a fair deal or we\\'re not going to have a deal at all and that\\'s okay too because we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasure and companies are leaving China because they want to avoid paying these large tariffs and by the way when the fake news tells you that you\\'re paying in the case of China they\\'ve devalued their currency that helps them and you know what else they\\'re doing they\\'re subsidizing those companies and you\\'re not paying very much if you\\'re paying anything at all the case of China and we are taking billions and billions of dollars in and remember this and you know it as well as I do we have never taken in ten cents from China we would lose five hundred billion dollars a year with China we rebuilt China they\\'ve done a great job but they took us for suckers and that includes Obama and Biden we took they took us for suckers 500 billion five hundred billion somebody said you mean five hundred million that\\'s a lot to write now five hundred billion dollars it\\'s actually more than that I don\\'t want to be too specific five hundred and seven we\\'re fighting against the same far-left politicians that ravaged our great cities and crushed the dreams of African American middle class the same people who threw open our borders and allowed drugs gangs and illegal labor to devastate our poorest American communities you know that our political opponents look down with hatred or our values and with utter disdain for the people whose lives they want to run that\\'s the way they\\'ve been doing it and if you take a look at the african-american community house how much progress has been made the lowest unemployment numbers in the history of our country they called you and us you remember this they called us deplorable that was a mistake that was a big mistake I\\'ll never forget I was making a speech after Hilary used the word deplorable and I didn\\'t think it was that bad you know why she used another word you know what the other word was she said deplorable zand irredeemable z-- I think that was worse but it didn\\'t get picked up you never know what\\'s gonna get picked up it didn\\'t I think irredeemable is worse than deplorable but I\\'ll never forget I was making a speech to the next day we had a big crowd and a great great state and women in particular were wearing we are deplorable the deplorable of you and there were hundreds and hundreds of people wearing we are deplorable and I said I think Hillary Clinton made a big mistake with that speech and that is the problem with politics one word and your career is ruined you never know you have to be very careful with the fakers back there I have news for Democrats who want to return us to the bitter failures and betrayals of the past we are not going back we\\'re going on to victory they\\'ll all take it away as fast as it came and as Mike Pence said a little while ago that\\'s why we want a little more time it\\'s going to be cemented it\\'s going to be cemented you know we have a big decision to make you know what I\\'m going to say we have to come up with the theme for the new campaign right is it going to be make America great again which is probably and possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics I think make America great again [Applause] manga Magga maggot country we\\'re in maggot country that I can\\'t undo but you know today we had a massive day on the stock market a lot of good things are happening but we had a very big day and we\\'re very close to I think our 68th record you know we\\'ve hit all-time records this tremendous I think it\\'s actually more than that but it\\'s a lot so now I say we\\'ve made America great again but how do you give up the number one call a theme logo statement in the history of politics for a new one but you know there\\'s a new one that really works and that\\'s called Keep America Keep America drunk in other words make America great again what we\\'ve really done it we\\'ve rebuilt our military is still in the process we\\'ve taken care of our vets we\\'ve cut the hell out of regulations you know I\\'ve cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country regardless of the length of their turn so now I say we need we have a lot of brilliant talent campaign people that cost a fortune and they never give me any ideas I\\'m only kidding so now I\\'m saying what do we use as our theme as our statement so I\\'m gonna ask you to vote on it I\\'m gonna go make America great again then Keep America great let me just here by your cheers what you like so in all fairness make America great the greatest of all time I really believe that the greatest of all time how do you give up the greatest of all time with a new thing because you know what\\'s gonna happen if I do it with a new theme I give up the greatest of all time and if I lose people are gonna say what a mistake that was but we\\'re not gonna lose so it\\'s not gonna matter we\\'re not get along are you ready first we do make America great again that we do keep America great let me hear it ready make America great again not bad but it says that three years ago wouldn\\'t be a contest right you ready Keep America great Wow I\\'m sorry maggot country but that wasn\\'t too close I thought you had it won and then I heard this year my eardrums will never be the same Keep America great pretty good we\\'re going to keep on fighting for every man and woman and child all across this land with every ounce of heart and mind and sweat and so we\\'re going to keep making America great again and then we will indeed keep America great better than ever before we\\'re going to keep it better than ever before and that is why tonight I stand before you to officially launch my campaign for a second term I can promise you that I will never ever let you down I won\\'t and I am profoundly thankful to my family I have a great family Melania Ivanka Tiffany Baron Lara Jared Robert Mary and Elizabeth and my late brother Fred jr. we\\'re joined tonight by many great Patriots who fight right by our side Florida\\'s terrific governor thank you Ron our first lady Casey

tell you they don\\'t stop Matt Gaetz Ted Yoho Michael Qualls and also all of our friends and our supporters you\\'ve been incredible this has been a tremendous night you\\'ve really been incredible since the very first day I walk through the doors of the White House I have never forgotten who sent me there you did you did you all did when I get behind my desk in the beautiful Oval Office I think about only one thing how the American people are going to win win win today and I\\'m fighting for you and I think you see that not easy but I love it and the reason I love it because there have been few presidents that have been able to do what we\\'ve been able to do for you and it is a great great feeling thank you together we\\'re breaking the most sacred rule in Washington politics we are keeping our promises to the American people because my only special interest is you I don\\'t have this special interest I don\\'t care and by the way by the way a woman who has been so good so talented so wonderful and we\\'re sort of going to be losing I have a feeling she\\'s going to be running for a certain gubernatorial position don\\'t worry about it Ron it\\'s not going to be in Florida it won\\'t be in Florida I promise you Casey she\\'d be tough right but a woman who is a special woman and ripe and her father by the way he\\'s out there fighting for us all the time Sarah Huckabee sander [Applause] Thank You mr. president this has been truly the honor of a lifetime one of the most incredible experiences anybody could ever imagine and that\\'s because I\\'ve had the chance to be on the front row of history and watch you drastically change our country for the better you\\'ve made America great you\\'re going to continue to make America great [Applause] but no one will be a stronger voice and more fierce advocate for this president because he\\'s fighting for all of the people in this room and for all of the people that you represent all over the country and he\\'s going to have an incredible six more years to make our country as strong as we\\'re gonna miss her we\\'re gonna miss her thank you sir credible a warrior since the election we have created six million new jobs Odie thought that would be possible they said it wouldn\\'t be possible we have lifted more than six million Americans off of food stamps and we\\'re getting off of welfare and back into the workforce of they\\'re so happy they are so the unemployment rate is the lowest rated spitted over 51 years think of it and as I said before about African American I now say also about Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment have reached the lowest rates in the history of our country unemployment an African American poverty has also reached by far the lowest rate in history these are incredible numbers and today right now as we speak almost 160 million people are working that\\'s more than ever before it\\'s the first time ever the number of people is almost 160 million and we\\'re going to be breaking that number soon women filled 60% of the new jobs created last year and women\\'s unemployment is now the lowest it\\'s been in 74 years wages are rising at the fastest rate in many decades and really what\\'s nice is they\\'re rising the fastest for the lowest income Americans isn\\'t that nice percentage-wise for fun and our pledge to the American worker through Ivanka Trump she has worked so hard she\\'s worked hard has secured commitments to provide private sector training opportunities to nearly ten million Americans it\\'s been an incredible story it\\'s been an incredible great job to get relief to working families we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history the largest we doubled the child tax credit and the typical family of four earning $75,000 has seen a tax cut of over $2,000 per year and that money goes right back into our economy a record-breaking regulatory reduction campaign has saved every American household an average of $3,000 per year and we\\'ve ended the last administration\\'s cruel and heartless war on American energy what they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten the United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world and something I want to make clear to the media we have among the cleanest and sharpest crystal clean you\\'ve heard me say that when crystal clean air and water anywhere on earth we are creating a future of American energy independence and yet our air and water are the cleanest they\\'ve ever been by far and importantly we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies when I came into office we inherited one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated the trans-pacific partnership would have put you all out of work TPP would have dealt the deathblow to the US auto industry which by the way is doing great many many plants are now under construction in Michigan in Ohio Pennsylvania North Carolina South Carolina Florida they hadn\\'t built one in decades and now they\\'re all over the place and my first week I would through the United States from the job-killing catastrophe that we know what that is TPP and the Paris environmental Accord not too good [Applause] I thought I was going to take a lot of heat on that I took none would have cost us trillions and trillions of dollars [Music] and we\\'re replacing the NAFTA disaster with the brand-new US MCA and USMC a that\\'s Mexico and Canada will create at least 75,000 new jobs for American autoworkers and give a massive boost to our farmers and ranchers and growers all across the Sunshine State and will hopefully soon have bipartisan support because everybody wants it to happen it replaces one of the worst freight deals ever made NAFTA NAFTA was a beauty it was really good if you want to see everybody leave our country thanks to our tariffs American steel mills are roaring back to life you know that and we\\'ve taken historic action to confront China\\'s chronic trading abuses it should have been done a long time ago but the days of stealing American jobs and American companies American ideas and wealth those days are over in the eight years before I took office on average we lost 2,000 manufacturing jobs a month since my inauguration we\\'ve added 16,000 manufacturing jobs a month that didn\\'t happen by accident remember the statement from the previous administration you\\'d need a magic wand to bring back manufacturing well will tell sleepy Joe that we found the magic wand the sleepy guy and to remedy pass and justices we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform we ended the clinton-era crime policies that unfairly affected the african-american community so unfair we are boldly confronting the opioid and drug addiction and you know what\\'s happening drug addiction is the scourge of our country and many other countries and we have made so much progress so much progress opioid down 17 18 19 and 21 percent in some places and I want to thank our first lady for having worked so hard on that paper and we\\'re expanding affordable healthcare creating plans 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we passed something I\\'m very proud of they\\'ve wanted to pass it for 45 years all of the gentlemen that are sitting here from Congress your Congressman your Senators they helped us it\\'s called right to try we have the greatest medical labs in the world we have incredible things under advisement and our people if they were very sick they were terminally ill they couldn\\'t get anything because people said no it might hurt them they\\'re terminally ill so I said that doesn\\'t make sense and these people if they were rich or had money they\\'d go to Asia they go to Europe they\\'d go all over the world looking for a cure because the FDA would not approve what we call right to try what a beautiful name right to try and I got it approved after 44 years and I saw a beautiful young woman the other day on television miss harp credible woman did anyone see her she was incredible and she was so thankful but she\\'s doing so well and they were giving her instructions on what you do when you\\'re dying and then all of a sudden this happened and now it looks like she\\'s going to be around for a long time and there are many many cases right right to try and I hope nobody in this room ever needs it but we now have it for the first time in half a century we\\'ve reduced the price of prescription drugs and our amazing veterans are no longer left to languish and die on endless waiting lists standing on line waiting for a doctor we passed VA choice so they can see that doctor our veterans were waiting on line for two days seven days three weeks five weeks you had veterans waiting on line that could have easily been taken care of they waited so long that became terminally ill in many cases the stories are horrible we passed VA choice you go out now you get a doctor you fix yourself up the doctor sends us the bill we pay for it and you know what it doesn\\'t matter because the life and the veteran is more important but we also happened to save a lot of money doing that can you believe it VA choice for the veteran they\\'ve been trying to get that past also for about 44 years we also passed VA accountability so that when somebody does bad things or mistreats our wonderful veterans we couldn\\'t do anything with them they were protected between civil service and unions and all of the problems it didn\\'t matter you couldn\\'t do anything now you can just say you\\'re fired get out get out get out and as we fight to make life better for all Americans the Democrat Party has become more radical more dangerous and more unhinged than at any point in the modern history of our country or nois you are Democrats more extreme and more Despres than when it comes to border security the Democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible it\\'s the greatest betrayal of the American middle class and frankly American life our country has as a whole nobody sees anything like it people are pouring in but we\\'ve stopped them and now as I said we have other people helping us including the country of Mexico let\\'s see how it works but we need you to call your Democrat congressman and your Democratic senator and get them to pass legislation working with these great men over here to close up the loopholes and to solve the asylum problem which can be done in 15 minutes the legal mass migration brings in millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs wages and opportunities against the most vulnerable Americans cutting off their path to the American dream thanks to democrat policies school children across the country are being threatened by the vicious gang ms-13 that ice by the way is taking out of our country and dropping them back home by the thousands by the thousands mass illegal migration reduces living standards and strains public resources if Democrat officials had to send their children to those overcrowded overburdened schools they would not tolerate it for one minute what\\'s happening with their policies are horrible our immigration laws are a disgrace and the Democrats can get together with the Republicans and solve the problem quickly one meeting Democrats in California even voted to give free health care to illegal aliens instead of helping homeless Americans in Democrat run cities Democrats support sanctuary cities Thank You governor Ron for ending that whole disaster they release dangerous criminal aliens into our communities run to Santa\\'s great job great really good thank you so slow it\\'s common sense it\\'s common sense sanctuary cities are an open attack on American law enforce an American family sacrificing American lives in pursuit of a callous political gender that\\'s all it is no one who supports sanctuary cities should be allowed to run for president of the United States Republicans believe welfare schools hospitals and public resources should be protected for all Americans and yes yes we are doing things that a few others have even tried to do we are making progress like nobody would believe where do you see some of the things that you\\'re going to be hearing about over the next few months we believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding citizens not for criminal aliens and we will always support and protect the heroes of ice Border Patrol and law enforcement generally throughout our country and in the ultimate act of moral cowardice not one Democrat candidate for president not a single one has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ice and Border Patrol the job they do is incredible against all odds with the bad laws they don\\'t have the character the virtue the spine to do it we have to thank them and we have to thank boy law enforcement what a job they do it\\'s time to pass Kate\\'s law and thanks your cities and catch-and-release deport vicious gang members which we\\'re doing stop human trafficking stop illegal immigration and establish a modern immigration system based on skills contributions and based on merit we want people to come into our country based on merit more than 120 Democrats in Congress have also signed up to support crazy Bernie Sanders socialist government takeover of health care he seems not to be doing too well lately they want to end Medicare as we know it and terminate the private health insurance of 180 million Americans who love their health insurance [Applause] America will never be a socialist country Republicans do not believe in socialism we believe in freedom and so do you we will defend Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors we will defend it like nobody else and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always virtually every top Democrat also now supports taxpayer-funded abortion right up to the moment of birth ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb leading Democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth you saw that [Applause] in Virginia Republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift from God that is why I am s Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion day by day we are rebuilding our country at home we are

nuclear deal and impose the toughest ever sanctions on the world\\'s number one state sponsor of terrorism which you are to get back to stability and peace in the Middle East because great nations do

communist and socialist regimes and we support the people of Cuba and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom Thank You Marco thank you Rick Thank You Lindsey [Applause] and nothing would make us happier than to be able to work with Democrats to rebuild our nation\\'s infrastructure to bring down drug prices to compete with other countries and to dominate the future as one American team it can happen it can happen it can have it\\'s looking like the Democratic Party does not want to do that but it can happen and it very well might there\\'s so many great things we can do right now and a bi-partisan way but they\\'ve been afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders but refuses to protect our borders that promotes jobs overseas but allows our factories to close that promotes democracy rule but shreds our Constitution at home that declares support for free speech and free thought but relentlessly suppresses them both and that constantly savages the heroes of American law enforcement we don\\'t want that we don\\'t want them no matter what label they use a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream so don\\'t ever forget this election is about you it\\'s about your family your future and the fate of your country we begin our campaign with the best record the

evening in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told the story of America it is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true it is the chronicle of brave citizens who never give up on the dream of a better and brighter future and it is the saga of thirteen separate colonies that United to form the most just and virtuous Republic ever conceived on this day two hundred and forty three years ago our founding fathers pledged their lives their fortunes are their sacred honor to declare independence and defend our god-given rights Thomas Jefferson wrote the words that forever changed the course of humanity we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness with a single sheet of parchment and 56 signatures America began the greatest political journey in human history but on that day the Patriots who would determine the ultimate success of the struggle were a hundred miles away in New York there the Continental Army prepared to make it stand commanded by the beloved General George Washington as the delegates debated the declaration in Philadelphia Washington\\'s army watched from Manhattan as a massive British invading fleet loomed dangerously across New York Harbor the British had come to crush the revolution in its infancy Washington\\'s message to his troops laid bare the stakes he wrote the fate of unborn millions will now depend under god on the courage and conduct of this army we have therefore to resolve to conquer or die days later General Washington ordered the declaration read aloud to the troops the assembled soldiers just joined an excited crowd running down Broadway they toppled a statue of King George and melted it into bullets for battle the faraway King would soon learn a timeless lesson about the people of this majestic land Americans loved our freedom and no one will ever take it away from us that same American spirit that emboldened our founders has kept us strong throughout our history to this day that spirit runs through the veins of every American patriot it lives on and each and every one of

rededicate our nation to a new birth of freedom and to resolve that we will always have a government of By and For the People our quest for greatness unleashed a culture of discovery that led Thomas Edison to imagine his lightbulb Alexander Graham Bell to create the telephone the Wright brothers to look to the sky and see the next great frontier for Americans nothing is impossible exactly fifty

training its first pilots to take these magnificent machines up and over the field of battle in World War one our fly boys rushed the skies of Europe and aces like Eddie Rickenbacker filled hearts and headlines with tales of daring duels and the clouds general Billy Mitchell saw the promise of this technology and risk court-martial in his quest for an independent air force he was proven right when empires across the oceans tried to carve up the world for themselves and America stood in the way we wouldn\\'t let it happen after Pearl Harbor Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle and his Raiders flew b-25 bombers off a carrier deck in the deep Pacific in a daring feat of American resolve and as President Roosevelt said the Nazis built the fortress around Europe but they forgot to put a roof on it

happening it\\'s wonderful to be back at this beautiful state with thousands of hard-working North Carolina Patriots and thank you for your support and thank you for that very big victory we had three years ago time is flying you getting ready let\\'s do it again right I just heard that the United States House of Representatives has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project I\\'ve ever been involved in the resolution how stupid is that or impeachment I want to thank those Democrats because many of them voted for us the vote was a totally lopsided 332 295 to one 332 295 think of it we have the strongest economy in history the lowest unemployment numbers ever we\\'ve rebuilt the most powerful military it was totally depleted when I took office we passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts of any president or any Administration in history we took care of our great vets including veterans choice and veterans accountability and they want to try and impeach it\\'s a disgrace [Applause] now we have that behind us and I have to say this and I\\'ll say just once what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the United States and I want to thank Republican leadership for what they\\'ve done for all of us by stopping that hoax the Russian hoax I call it because America is winning again America is respected again and because we are finally putting America first our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words jobs jobs jobs we\\'ve created six million new jobs since election day if I would have said that nobody would have believed it if I would have said that the fake news would have said he\\'s exaggerating and I wouldn\\'t have said it because I wasn\\'t even sure we could do think of it six million jobs since election day and by the way North Carolina has had its best economic year in the history of your stand our country\\'s added more than 180,000 people to the workforce and think of that through what we\\'ve done on a federal basis you picked up over a hundred and eighty thousand jobs North Carolina thank you and you have your lowest unemployment rate you have a lot of good things but let\\'s not talk too much about North Carolina let\\'s win this election nationwide you remember North Carolina that was going to be the Clinton firewall she spent a fortune here and I kept coming in and coming out they called it earned media I earned it I kept coming in and coming out and every time I left they said I don\\'t think we\\'re losing North Carolina you know what I was right we want it we want it ezel [Music] so I just want to thank everybody seriously this is a big that was a big deal November 8th that was a big deal Donald Trump has won the great state of North Carolina that was when you started to see the folks at a certain other convention beautiful looking place one of the most beautiful venues have ever seen but I don\\'t want any part of it it was unlucky I don\\'t want any part but that\\'s when you saw the people saying what the hell is going on what\\'s happening and then it was state after state it was Florida it was South Carolina we love South Carolina right it was Pennsylvania remember they wouldn\\'t announce the numbers in Pennsylvania so there was one percent of the vote remaining if I lost every one of those votes we still win by a lot and they wouldn\\'t announce me they wouldn\\'t in it and then we won the great state of Wisconsin first time in many many decades and then we had a surprise but not a surprise to us because we\\'re bringing back the auto industry brought so much back to the great state of Michigan that was a shocker remember you remember certain hand on that beautiful board and they said you know this sport is getting awfully red that\\'s Republican there\\'s a lot of red up there we had a lot of that was one hell of a night what\\'s the I think it was maybe you know there are those that say one of the most extraordinary and exciting evenings in the history of television and the history of anything and you know you can go all over the world in some cases it was morning you go to Asia you go to Europe you go all over it was just record-setting and here\\'s the point we have to do it again we have to do it [Applause] and the reason we have to not only to do new things which we will and you know statutorily and we had all sorts of artificial witch hunts over our head can you imagine if we didn\\'t have to go through that hoax I don\\'t know that we would have done any better to be honest with you I think we\\'ve done more in two and a half years than any president ever first two and a half year but could you imagine what it could have been if we didn\\'t have the witch hunt you said it I won\\'t say it because it\\'s a Harrell it\\'s a terrible work so I will not say that this guy said if we didn\\'t have the bullshit that\\'s right [Applause] no no could you imagine if we didn\\'t have the time wasted the time and everything can you imagine and you know a friend of mine said maybe you wouldn\\'t have done as well is that possible that can happen maybe we would have had too much time in our hands who knows but I can say nobody in their first two and a half years has done anywhere close to what we not be what we wall down so the unemployment rate among african-americans is the lowest in the history of our country unemployment among Hispanic Americans where we\\'re doing really well you know why because they want a strong voter they want it because they understand the border better than anybody they want that strong border they want that wall that\\'s being built right now [Applause] and they really do they understand the border better than anybody and they don\\'t want criminals coming in they don\\'t want crime coming if they don\\'t want to lose their jobs they like the fact that their salaries are going up their wages are going up they understand it better so hispanic-american the best unemployment numbers in our history Asian Americans the best unemployment numbers in our history and likewise women 74 years so I\\'m sorry women I let you down it\\'s not in our history but we\\'re gonna be there very soon we\\'re gonna be there very soon women are doing incredibly and women the men are gonna get out sorry man whoa look at all those signs women women for Trump thank you it\\'s a lot of signs if you remember last election Donald Trump will never ever get the women then we got this tremendous we got this tremendous number of women and during the election night this at what\\'s going on you know what\\'s called suppression polls suppression polls are just as fake as the news itself but women filled 60% and I\\'m sorry to tell you this men they\\'re gonna sue me for discrimination now women fell sixty percent of all of the new jobs created last year women took 60% what\\'s wrong with you man but the Radical Democrats are trying to destroy all of our country\\'s tremendous achievement and our country\\'s tremendous success unprecedented we\\'ve had unprecedented success leaders come in from other countries Prime Minister\\'s presidents kings queens dictators sometimes I hate to say it dictators and they all start off by saying mr. president I\\'d like to congratulate you on the incredible economy that you\\'ve created the greatest anywhere in the world by far and sadly China will have a very good relationship with President Xi I really like him but China has had yesterday it was announced the worst year in 27 years and we\\'ve had the best and if our opponent ever got into office instead of being up 62% instead of those 401 k\\'s of yours being up 60 70 80 90 % big crash you would have had a crash the likes of which we have never seen before if they got in office because we freed up our country we freed up our economy with especially with regulation cuts but also with those big beautiful tax cuts we freedom at the leading voices of the Democrat Party our left-wing extremists who reject everything our nation stands for but again I have to tell you this vote was so big I have to thank many of the Democrats I mean that was an amazing no no I really do I respect it I really do that was a that was a slaughter but many of those people that voted for us this afternoon and somewhat of a sneak attack a real sneak attack many of those people that voted wars were Democrats and I want to thank them because they did the right thing for our country [Applause] Republicans know that America is the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of our world but these left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil the way they speak so badly of our country they want to demolish our Constitution weaken our military eliminate the values that built this magnificent country you have to look at some of their recent comments which you never talked about when you see the fourth Congress women oh isn\\'t that lovely [Music] I\\'ll give you just a couple I\\'ve have pages and pages but we don\\'t want to bore you in order to go to long but we have to give a couple because that\\'s the great thing about live television they can\\'t cut it representative Ilan Omar of a really great state I almost won first time in decades and decades Minnesota great step [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] by the way I keep hearing how much enthusiasm is in the radical left I don\\'t think they have enthusiasm they\\'re just fighting with each other we have all of the enthusiasm [Music] [Applause] he goes home now to mommy and he gets reprimanded and that\\'s the end sorry mommy sorry mom didn\\'t mean to embarrass your mom but it\\'s true we have the enthusiasm folks look at this look at this and by the way thousands and thousands of people outside and people that couldn\\'t get in thousands we\\'ve got all the enthusiasm they\\'re fighting each other they\\'ve gotten so far left nobody wants to even think about it so representative Omar blame the United for the terrorist attacks on our country saying that terrorism is a reaction to our involvement in other people\\'s affairs she\\'s feared US service members involved in Black Hawk Down in other words she slandered the brave Americans who were trying to keep peace in Somalia Oumar minimize the September 11th attacks on our homeland saying some people did something I don\\'t think so some people did something yeah some people did something alright she pleaded for compassion for Isis recruits attempting to join the terrorist organization she was looking for coming Omar left that Americans speak of al-qaeda in a menacing tone and remark that you don\\'t say America with this intensity you say al-qaeda makes you proud al Qaeda makes you proud you don\\'t speak that way about America and at a press conference just this week when asked whether she supported al-qaeda that\\'s our enemy that\\'s our enemy they are a very serious problem that we take care of but they always seem to come along somewhere she refused to answer she didn\\'t want to give an answer to that question Omar blamed the United States for the crisis in Venezuela we think of that one and she looks down with contempt on the hardworking Americans saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country [Music] and obviously and importantly Omar has a history of launching vicious anti-semitic screens [Applause] and she talked about the evil Israel and it\\'s all about the Benjamins not a good thing to say so that\\'s Omar that\\'s Alma and by the way many other things all you have to do is press the right button or in your beautiful screen and you\\'ll see things that you didn\\'t hear this over the last two days oh did you hear anybody talk about her colleague representative Rasheeda Talib greet with Omar\\'s characterization of 911 and said that members of Congress who support Israel forgot what country they represent and Talib also use the F word to describe the presidency and your president that said nice even for me she was describing the President of the United States and the presidency with the big fat vicious the way she said it vicious f-word that\\'s not somebody that loves our country representative Alexandria okay zo [Music] check out her scores by the way with her new green you do the green New Deal where did that come from she\\'s conducted outrageous attacks against men and women of law enforcement she compared American border agents managing a humanitarian crisis that I always said was a humanitarian crisis and they said it was manufactured they don\\'t say it was manufactured and we\\'re stopping it and I want to thank Mexico they\\'ve got 21,000 soldiers now [Applause] but Cortez somebody said that\\'s not her name it\\'s they said that\\'s not her name sir I said no no I don\\'t have time to go with three different name we\\'ll call her Cortez too much time takes too much time so Cortez also she said essentially Nazis are running concentration camps and when Mike Pence went down just a few days ago with members of Congress and the media and you looked at those so-called horrible concentration camps they said wow these places are clean Wow they have air conditioning they have water and you know to be honest it\\'s not like they came and and we want to take care of people we got it straightened out our immigration laws you know in a very short period of time if the Democrats would give us a few votes we could solve the immigration problem and it would be so bad but these kids and these people come from rough places and I\\'ll tell you what some of them said we\\'ve never lived like this before they have water they have air conditioning they have things that they\\'ve never seen and we listened to her talking about drinking water from toilets which was a lie which was a lie Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be can you believe that that\\'s what she\\'s saying [Music] she described contemporary America that\\'s you that\\'s me that\\'s all of us as garbage garbage [Music] you remember deplorable right that sounds worse I think that\\'s worse but we\\'ll save it for whoever is going to be the nominee and right now sleepy Joe\\'s not looking too good Pocahontas Pocahontas is gaining a little bit because we probably used the Pocahontas a little bit too early but that\\'s okay we\\'ll bring it out of retirement very soon [Applause] they have a new one who knocked the hell out of Biden during a debate he said I wasn\\'t prepared for that question that\\'s not a good answer can you imagine and according to the polls I want every single debate Republican and against Hillary can you imagine those are the polls they would bet that many many polls but can you imagine how I said oh I\\'m sorry I wasn\\'t prepared for that question I\\'m I\\'m gone that\\'s the end of Trump he\\'s not prepared he\\'s not mentally prepared that\\'s his problem but everybody that knows him knows that but no Harris hit him with the pretty easy question on busing what I would say that\\'s pretty easy and he choked he choked and then he said I I\\'m sorry I ran out of time by [Applause] he ran out of time and then you have a younger Buddha judge booth at judge they\\'re saying how to say his name booth edge edge he\\'s a beauty he runs a failed city his city is doing so badly Mike Pence was the governor of that state I said how was he as as the bear Mike is one of the nicest human beings you\\'ll ever meet he said and Mike said he never did a good job I\\'m so shocked to see him running okay and then he goes back home and african-americans literally were so angry at him for the lousy job and he\\'s supposed to be like a hot young star if that\\'s the hot young star I guess I just don\\'t know stardom anymore that is not a star that\\'s not a star boot edge edge you say boot and then add edge edge put it H I don\\'t see him dealing with President Xi of China I don\\'t see him meeting successfully with kim jonghwan I don\\'t see him dealing and nobody has been tougher with Russia than Donald Trump and we have good relationships with them and many others except now we\\'re no longer the suckers like with NATO we protect Europe we spent hundreds of billions of dollars and they\\'re not paying their fair share so last year I went I said folks sorry you got to pay your fair share 16 years it was going like this the contribution and now it\\'s like a rocket ship a hundred billion dollars [Applause] and I said to him great people 28 nations including the US I said to him listen we\\'re taking care of you you screw us on trade and you don\\'t pay your military bills this is not a good deal for the United States so we\\'re taking care of trades we want to do it nice and slow and easy you know we got a world balance but European Union is terrible to us or a terrible frankly they\\'re as tough or tougher than China just smaller numbers that\\'s the only difference with China five hundred and seven billion as you look over these for many many years they\\'ve been taken and guys like Biden say oh whoa wid supple he was there eight years we\\'d stop that no Trump is stopping it Trump is [Applause] so represented Ayanna Presley she related in any way to Elvis I don\\'t know who knows you never know she thinks that people with the same skin color all need to think the same she said we don\\'t need any more brown faces that don\\'t want to be brown voices we don\\'t need black faces that don\\'t want to be a black voice and you here we are [Applause] you we did fall two people that have taken a lot of shots to the face but they wouldn\\'t attack some of these people in this room they\\'re not attacking bikers for Trump then or millon you know they\\'re attacking a single man standing there with a camera who never got hit and never hit back before in his life they don\\'t attack the people they attack picture that wouldn\\'t look too good people these are sick bad people remember that these are bad [Music] they don\\'t get the bad press the press doesn\\'t want to talk to them they are very evil they\\'re hitting people over the head with sticks and I mean six I mean bats even they\\'re whacking people with bats they\\'re very brave they wish you up with a mask and they\\'re covered because then they go home to mom and dad they don\\'t want mom and dad to know where they were but they always attack people that really can\\'t defend you you that\\'s the very brave they wish you up with a mask and they\\'re covered because then they go home to mom and dad they don\\'t want mom and dad to know where they were but they always attack people that really can\\'t defend themselves very well right they\\'re not attacking this group they\\'re not attacking North Carolina [Applause] [Music] so these congresswoman their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant heart left but that so they are very evil they\\'re hitting people over the head with sticks and I mean six I mean bats even they\\'re whacking people with bats they\\'re very brave they wish you up with a mask and they\\'re covered because then they go home to mom and dad they don\\'t want mom and dad to know where they were but they always attack people that really can\\'t defend themselves very well right they\\'re not attacking this group they\\'re not attacking North Carolina so these Congress women their comments are helping to fuel the rise of a dangerous militant heart left but that\\'s okay because we\\'re gonna win this election like nobody\\'s ever seen before the hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down they never have anything good to say that\\'s why I say hey if they don\\'t like it let them leave let them leave [Applause] they\\'re always telling us how to run it how to do this how did that you know what if they don\\'t love it tell them to leave it [Applause] and now watch I\\'ll go back to that Oh sir that was so controversial sir now I\\'m just saying it\\'s their choice they can come back when they want but you know they don\\'t love our country I think in some cases they hate our country and they\\'re so angry even yesterday they won on the stage I said let me watch this and the anger they were trying to be nice but it\\'s hard it\\'s hard for them to do their the choice for every American has never been more clear that\\'s true the Democrat agenda is anti-worker anti jobs anti citizen anti family and anti common sense [Music] [Applause] with the exception of all of those Democrats that voted for us today we\\'ll give them a fine they are fine and they you know you lose to them it\\'s different it\\'s okay it\\'s called normal political back-and-forth but I want to tell you something the Democrats are being so violent so vicious moving so far left it\\'s out of control it\\'s out of control the Republican agenda is pro-worker Pro jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100% pro-american [Applause] [Music] so win thrilled tonight to be joined by several North Carolina Republican leaders really great people they\\'ve been so helpful to me and they\\'re doing an incredible job lieutenant governor Dan Forrest North Carolina treasurer Dale Falwell [Applause] Greenville bear PJ Connelly I hear he does a good job and North Carolina GOP chair Michael

Gregg Murphy Gregg is our winner Thank You President Trump for coming back to eastern North Carolina this is Trump country and I promise if elected your Congressman I will be a congressman that has our presidents back the third District the third District is not going to elect another Pelosi congressman so we thank him for coming to eastern North Carolina and we are here to support him thank you all so you know Gregg will be great on jobs all the things you want tough-on-crime strong on borders pushing the wall he\\'ll be pushing it like nobody but we\\'re building the wall but we\\'re pushing it it\\'s like pulling teeth we\\'ve got six lawsuits on the wall we\\'ve won two of them we\\'re gonna win others but you think is easy don\\'t you folks do you think this is easy but we\\'re building a lot of wall and we hope if we can win that final one so important it\\'s going before the Supreme Court we\\'ll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of so go out get Greg elected great victory by the way that was a great primary and a great victory that same day there\\'s another crucial election in North Carolina\\'s knife condition you know what right you know what we\\'re talking about night I know it\\'s not here but it\\'s very close right ninth congressional district the Democrat in the race is an ultra liberal named Dan McReady wants to take away your guns he wants to raise you taxes he doesn\\'t care about borders he likes open borders and he really admires socialism I don\\'t think that works too well in North Carolina does it work too well in our country we\\'re joined tonight by the Republican candidate who is really a special man a great man he\\'s going to be a great great congressman dan bishop dan [Applause] so as President Trump said there are two dams in this race Dan McReady said that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to democracy ever and backed crooked Hillary [Music] Dan McReady took money from Ilhan Omar and mr. president Dan McReady wants to repeal your tax cuts now he would be the wrong Dan as for me I\\'m going to go to Washington and I\\'m going to stand with President Donald J Trump and that makes me the right Dan and with the help of President Trump we\\'re going to win the ninth district so go to vote Dan Bishop calm side up in hell thank you thank you again thank you Dan and he will indeed defend your values your family and he will always defend our Second Amendment unlike their opponents they\\'re really into destroying yourself we\\'ve been violently operating for more than 10 years we got them all we think they are no good with conducting brutal medieval style killings in or medieval stylers okay little pieces little pieces little pieces medieval style including the dismemberment of their victims and they enjoyed every minute of it these are sick people when I call them animals Nancy Pelosi said how dare he used that name these are human beings I don\\'t think they [Music] most of those indicted were in our country illegally 19 to be exact 19 of 20 to think of that they want to protect these are savage beasts these are savage killers and they should have been brought out a long time ago by the Obama administration we\\'re bringing ms-13 out by the thousands getting them the hell out of our control and when you read about deportation and Sunday we\\'ve got a lot of people and Sunday but we have a lot of people and we\\'re always shooting for the bad ones first which makes sense right but when you hear about that we always want to get and and by the way you don\\'t have dangerous it is for these ice agents these ice and Border Patrol but ice they go into a nest they call it a nest a nest of these killers they\\'re tough they\\'re smart and you know what they\\'re great Patriots they love our country the danger that they have is comparable and I just want to salute and I have to tell you I want to salute ice and Border Patrol and I want to support I want to support absolute law enforcement in the United States these are great people these are great people and they don\\'t get the credit they deserve but you know what I tell them all the time you have no idea how much the American people the American public you have no idea how much they love you and respect you law enforcement in the recent Democrat debate every single candidate everyone Biden was a little bit slower with the hand it didn\\'t work so well they raised their hand in favor of giving free government health care they raised their hand in giving a lot of other things that I don\\'t think you\\'re gonna be happy with illegal aliens will be very nicely covered how about California they just approved a hundred million dollars they just approved a hundred million dollars to take care of the needs of illegal immigrants and then you look on the sidewalks of Los Angeles the sidewalks of San Francisco Nancy Pelosi\\'s district nobody\\'s ever seen anything like it in the history of our country what\\'s happening there so if you don\\'t want Democrats to raid your health care to steal away your money to bankrupt your country then you have a choice you must vote Republican all American citizens including millions and millions of legal immigrants who work hard to come into our country who study wait online sometimes for ten years and who respect our laws and followed the rules they deserve a government that is loyal to them they work hard you can\\'t say you love our country if you want to destroy it through open borders open borders are a disaster human trafficking you know the first time I heard as a politician human trafficking nobody talks about it it sounded almost like an ancient crime many many years ago hundreds of years thousands of years ago human trafficking it\\'s the worst now throughout the world because of the Internet it\\'s the worst it\\'s ever been and the worst treated of all children but it\\'s women women the Democrats want to do nothing about it human trafficking is worse than it ever has been in the history of the world not justice this is not a United States problem this is all over the world human trafficking it\\'s a terrible terrible thing and we could solve it you know most of it comes through in this country our southern border where we don\\'t have the wall they\\'re not going through our points they\\'re not going through areas where we have security where we have guards where we have gates where we have all sorts of equipment no they ride through the desert and they make a left where you don\\'t have the wall it\\'s so simple everybody knows it you know the Democrats all know it because five years ago before I was here they all wanted it now they don\\'t want it you know why they don\\'t want it for political reasons and you know what it\\'s gonna cost them a lot of points in the election I think probably close to the election and just lastly Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release violent criminal aliens onto our streets you know where we just picked up these 22 thugs he\\'s 22 monsters we just picked him up in where Los Angeles sanctuary city wonderful sanctuary city thom tillis senator recently introduced a bill to give American victims the right to sue sanctuary cities and hold them accountable for the thousands of lives they have shattered they shattered [Applause] thank you very much Tom every nation has the right to establish and enforce immigration rules in its national interest it\\'s very simple isn\\'t it it\\'s common sense it\\'s so simple and the voters understand it we expect that those who seek to join our society will obey our laws Revere our Constitution cherish our history support themselves financially and embrace our American values and love our American flag we believe in an immigration system based on merit merit where they come in we have so many companies coming in automobile companies companies of all types and we need workers we actually need workers we have the lowest unemployment rate that we\\'ve had in 51 years soon it\\'ll be the lowest ever we need workers but they have to come in where they can help our country they have to come in based on merit and we\\'re putting in bills and let\\'s see what happens otherwise we\\'ll just wait till we win back the house win the senate win the presidency [Applause] Democrats have never been further outside of the mainstream they\\'re going crazy folks they\\'re going crazy more than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for Bernie Sanders total government takeover of health care isn\\'t that nice this is one of the great content what happen he knows that you know the guy never passed the bill he did he did nothing he\\'s actually not even a Democrat isn\\'t he an independent that he\\'s running but wishing he missed this time hey Bernie let me save you a lot of time and effort Bernie you you missed your time it got taken from you four years ago burning that don\\'t do well he\\'s not doing too well but that\\'s okay I got a handed to him he\\'s up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic I said to our first lady the other day I was watching Bernie and he\\'s screaming his hairs all crazy I\\'m gonna do this I\\'m gonna do that no more college loans no more cost for anything nothing not you\\'re not gonna pay for anything I mean he\\'s desperate now he\\'s desperate you don\\'t have to pay for anything you know I jumped I said and everybody will get a free rolls lawyers every family gets a free rolls royce every family and the media said Donald Trump is exaggerating he knows that they\\'re not getting a Rolls Royce oh I\\'m sorry I\\'m sorry I\\'m sorry don\\'t put it don\\'t put it don\\'t put it don\\'t put that I said free Rolls Royce now but Bernie\\'s desperate now I watch them up there it\\'s a sad situation but I think they\\'re all sad when you get right down to it for instance okay we\\'re in this incredible state North Carolina day you have your best economy that you\\'ve ever had forget the country for a second you have the best economy you\\'ve ever had you have your best unemployment numbers you have the most people working than at any time in the history of your state you have your best black unemployment numbers best Hispanic unemployment numbers best women unemployment homes best Asian unemployment numbers okay [Applause] so what\\'s my whoever the opponent is what they gonna just say North Carolina I\\'m gonna do a great job you have the best numbers in the history of our country in your state so I don\\'t know and we weren\\'t by a lot [Applause] and we won by a lot you know I was telling Mike I was telling my son Eric Trump and Loras here by the way who was born in North Carolina all right I do a good job large you love this state so and her brothers here I have I have to tell you he went to this College [Applause] and Brad parce qu\\'elle is here the world\\'s tallest campaign manager in the history of the world he\\'s the tallest and there\\'s but most importantly he\\'s the best world\\'s tallest manager but he\\'s the best Vantage - thank you bread great job and he just told me our poll numbers are through the roof he just told me that so I\\'ll take that I mean we are a year and a half away but we\\'re doing well you see it you\\'d know you\\'d be the first to know number one you wouldn\\'t be here okay you wouldn\\'t be here we haven\\'t had an empty seat in any event I don\\'t believe that we\\'ve ever been to I don\\'t think we\\'ve ever had we always have people we haven\\'t had an FCC you look I mean anywhere North Carolina Ohio no matter where we go we pack it and we have thousands and thousands of people and we put screens outside and all tonight\\'s not so good we got a hundred degrees out but you still have thousands of people out there we could have sold this arena out you know that we could have sold this arena out tonight ten times can you believe that which I think that\\'s like a poll right that\\'s like a poll because when Biden goes out I see sleepy Joe he says they had 115 people show up 150 people that\\'s our first row the Democrat record on health care is one of deception and destruction the last administration said a lie if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor 28 times a total lie my administration is defending your sacred right to choose the doctor and the plan that you want and we are offering plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and a lot of people are starting to figure that out better health care and we\\'ll also always protect peace that you have to remember this you ready because they give us a bum rap patients with pre-existing conditions are protected by Republicans much more so than protected by Democrats who will never be able to pull it off [Applause] preexisting conditions and you know the job we\\'ve done on health care it\\'s not talked about but we\\'re also doing something it\\'s been phenomenal we have a hundred and eighty million people right now really happier in private plans and you know what they\\'re going to be taken away under the Democrats plan all of those people that are thrilled where they went out and negotiated cross state lines all of the things they did they went out negotiated great private plans they were it\\'s all gonna be taken away from you under this plan now I only hope they don\\'t change because you know we\\'re talking too soon we got a year and a half left it\\'s like when I called Pocahontas Pocahontas I should have waited six minutes because she then went out and got that test 1,024 and I\\'ve always said I have more Indian blood in me than she has in her and I have none I have none but it\\'s more than she has 1025 but I brought it up too soon so I don\\'t talk about it anymore but if she should be the candidate which I tend to doubt but if she should be will bring it up again and I think it\\'ll be very successful one thousand twenty-fourth how about this I was driving her crazy so she went out and hired a guy to check the blood I\\'m sure he had a lot of fun doing that he checked her blood and found out that many many many many many many years ago there could have been somebody and he could have been Indian and then the Indians got together and they said we don\\'t want her [Applause] we want Trump we want to they want we\\'ve taken historic action [Music] [Applause] so we\\'ve taken historic action to fight the opioid epidemic what a problem and just today it was just announced before I came in that drug overdose death were working so hard on this including our vice president including our first lady including everybody in the Trump administration it\\'s dropped for the first time in more than 30 years it\\'s gone down and in North Carolina and we\\'re far from finished it\\'s a big problem it declined 8% last year that\\'s a lot because it was just going up like a rocket virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from the right up until the moment of birth well then you have the gentleman from our governor from Virginia so we\\'re talking about late term he\\'s talking about the baby is born before the mother makes the decision that was the first that\\'s the first I\\'ve heard of it that\\'s the first most of you have heard of it and then they passed legislation in various states saying that\\'s okay this is a baby that\\'s born this is in late term [Applause] this is a baby that\\'s born nobody\\'s ever heard anything like that nobody has ever seen anything like it nobody\\'s ever seen anything like it and that actually when he had the scandal that became can you believe it the second biggest story can you believe that how important it is and yet that was the second biggest story and what a shame when that\\'s the second biggest story what happened to our values Republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift of God that\\'s why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion of babies Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion intolerance and division the Republican Party is the party for all Americans and American values we are the party of the American worker the American family and we are the party of the American dream this is the proud banner the Republican Party will carry into the Republican National Convention next summer in the great City of Charlotte North Carolina [Music] don\\'t disappoint me that should be good for at least ten points right these are some of the greatest ladies I see them in Ohio and Florida we love you too thank you really how many have you been - just out of curiosity but - I\\'ve done hundreds of them and then they say women don\\'t like Trump I think they do you know no I see them they\\'re great great ladies you\\'re great you know it\\'s interesting with women so women want to have strong military protection they want to have strong borders they want to have strong law enforcement they want to have great education they want to have low taxes for their family not high taxes they want to have all the things that we talk about why wouldn\\'t they want Trump more than anybody else the other side is gonna go and they did in the last election and we do it a lot better you know the difference is the last election I was a successful businessman running for president said I was going to do things and by the way really successful I\\'m gonna show you something someday soon I better show you something you know they say he was really successful he wasn\\'t successful he\\'s really smart or he\\'s really stupid but he\\'s trying to take over the world you know they have so many messages he\\'s really stupid then next week Donald Trump has a sinister plot to take over the world can\\'t be custom because they actually think it\\'s working right I saw one of these so-called comedians the other day that means you know pretty respected comedian he said he\\'s not leaving I\\'m telling you he\\'s not leaving he\\'ll never leave he\\'ll win this election and in 24 I\\'m telling you he\\'s not leaving he\\'s gonna stick so we did through our friend Dan scavino we did a Time magazine cover I was on so many times I don\\'t even read this thing and it says Trump 2014-2018 right but it says 20 here\\'s where we go we start at 16 we go to 20 we go to 24 did you see it then it says 28 32 36 40 40 now we don\\'t need any more time we don\\'t need any more time we need one more the senator came to my office sir I\\'m 6 4 7 I\\'m great I\\'m 6 to 7 so I can give you great advice I said senator I\\'m one for one but it happened to be the president and now I want to be 250 you to p2v2 so we have 16 we have 20 we have 24 and you know it\\'s very interesting though they there are really people out there think I\\'m not leaving can you believe it hey maybe that is a good idea let\\'s watch you want to drive them crazy they\\'re gonna go crazy all I have to do is say let\\'s think about it they\\'re gonna go crazy no no I promise I promise 2024 I leave [Applause] by that time just so you know by that time our country will be so well seated it will be so strong like never ever in our history but everything that we built low taxes strong military taking care of our vets all of the things we\\'ve done can be decimated very quickly if the wrong person gets in especially now you know I\\'ve always said 2016 was the most important election maybe in the history of our country a lot of people felt that so I don\\'t know I can\\'t say this is more important what we did was a miracle not to us it wasn\\'t but a lot of people said it was the greatest election we\\'ve ever had there\\'s never been anything like it never been such excitement never been such excitement but you know what if we don\\'t win in 2020 everything that we\\'ve done seriously though everything that we\\'ve done you\\'re 401\\'s they\\'re going to crash the whole thing it\\'s going to come down like a stack of cards so in a certain way let\\'s say this is of equal importance by that time we\\'ll have values instilled will have free enterprise and still people are working now we have the lowest food stamps that we\\'ve had in many years slowest food stamp because people know [Applause] so I really think it\\'s you know at least equal its equal maybe it\\'s a little less who the hell knows I just know this it can disappear very very quickly we have to get out we have to vote that\\'s why I\\'m starting early I mean we can you believe it we have less I mean I see all these clowns on television I guess we have to counteract them a little bit but this is not what you want running none of them this is not what you want running this incredible country of ours every day we make good on the motto promises may promises kept I\\'ve had people back there I\\'ve had people back there that don\\'t like me and somebody said very nicely that he\\'s actually made certain promises and he\\'s actually kept more promises than he\\'s made it\\'s true I mean I\\'ve done things I\\'ve done things that I never I never said we were going to get as an example with our vets that we were going to get choice that we were going to have the ability to fire people that don\\'t treat our vets properly we can fire them then they\\'ve been trying to get that for 44 years choice they\\'ve been trying to get practically from the beginning choice so simple and yet they never got it nobody got it through we\\'re good at getting things through we\\'ve done more than we said we would and a man I know who I don\\'t like a businessman very very very successful visit what are the most successful but I don\\'t like them never liked him he never liked me either by the way in fact I would go a step further he kids they cannot stand me and I saw him about two months ago and he came up to me I said how you doing very warm you know fur hey how you doing huh let\\'s get out of here and he said I\\'m doing good you\\'re doing good I said yeah I said you know you don\\'t like me and I don\\'t like you I never have liked you and you never have liked me but you\\'re gonna support me because you\\'re a rich guy and if you don\\'t support me you\\'re gonna be so goddamn poor you\\'re not gonna [Music] and he said to me mr. president you know cause we mr. president everyone calls me mr. president it\\'s true it\\'s a funny thing he said mr. president you\\'re right I\\'m supporting you I think you\\'re doing a great job and maybe we didn\\'t get along but it\\'s not like he has a choice he has no choice and in top of that it\\'s a good choice cuz we\\'ve done the right thing and it is funny you know with the name mr. president so I have friends really good friends and they\\'ve always called me Don Donald beech they call me anything right and you lose all your friends when you\\'re president because they\\'re all afraid to talk to you does that make sense no it\\'s true except except for these

country again our country is respected again we\\'ve confirmed more than 125 federal judges to apply the law as written including two Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh we\\'ve launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs and last year this is I\\'m so proud of this because we have no help from the Democrats last year for the first time in over 50 years drug prices went down [Applause] to give former prisoners a second chance of life we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform it\\'s a big thing you know prisoners they\\'ve got out of jail and they never had an economy like this and we did a lot of things because they get out of jail they don\\'t have a chance they always go back most of the time now they\\'re coming out and we have programs but most of all we have this great economy where people are hiring prisoners and you have to see the reviews they\\'re getting they\\'re getting phenomenal reviews it\\'s a beautiful thing it\\'s a beautiful thing what\\'s happening with prisoners they get out and they can actually get a job and that\\'s what\\'s happening we\\'re very proud [Applause] we\\'re expanding opportunity zone so that no American is left behind it\\'s one of the great successes the opportunity zones nobody talks about it\\'s what are the great successes and thanks to our pledge to America\\'s workers private sector partners will provide apprenticeships and job training to nine million Americans isn\\'t that nice and whenever I hear that word apprentice I say I love that word that was a good chair they figured you know what we\\'ll do we\\'ll get Otto Schwartz a negative take my place that didn\\'t work out too well that didn\\'t work out too well we had 14 seasons think of that The Apprentice I proudly signed for bipartisan human trafficking laws securing four hundred million dollars to support victims of human trafficking and we have secured soon-to-be three years record funding for our military we want to cut budgets but this is the odd budget I would through the United States from the horrible one-sided disgusting Iran nuclear deal and Iran is a different country today my administration proudly recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem that was some day they all said many many presidents have said we\\'re going to do them they never did I know why because the pressure on them was enormous not to do it and then on top of it a couple of months ago I just approved the Golan Heights for Israel they go along hi another thing 52 years they tried to do that they didn\\'t get it done so we\\'re doing good will you also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we condemn those that want to stop freedom in that country and other contract tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country will never ever be a socialist country it just a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American Dream frankly the destruction of our country that\\'s what\\'s going to happen take a look around their party is afflicted with an ideological sickness that protects foreign borders but refuses to protect our own borders think of it they fight all over there were a lot of those people are coming back home folks they\\'re coming back home a lot we defeated Isis you know the Caliphate and Syria we\\'re bringing our soldiers back home Isis does not like me too much but I came here and it was a mess it was a mess and I met with

stronger now than it was three years ago this is the strongest movement in the history of our country [Applause] but we are where one movement where one people one family and one glorious nation under God we\\'re doing things that nobody thought was possible no other nation thought it was possible what we\\'re doing we are so respected you have no idea how our nation has gone so far up in the eyes and the minds of the rest of the world so respected because together we will make America wealthy again of course we did just hit the highest price in the history of the market so pretty soon I hate

that is Swift it was good and it worked out well and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young agent look what happened to all of us right look what happened look what happened but I was watching the so-called debate last night and I also watched the night before there was long long television and the Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically and this morning that\\'s all the fake news was talking about that wasn\\'t pretty now we\\'re doing good it\\'s great to be back in the state that I love I love this state very special very very special on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hard-working Patriots of the American heartland Thank You Ohio we love you Ohio so we\\'ve got thousands of people standing outside and I asked the officials can we stick them up along the aisles can they sit on the stairs but I\\'ll tell you what this is some crowd some turnout we\\'ve sold tens of thousands of tickets did you know what the sale price is we keep it nice and low to keep it nice and low but there never has been a movement like this this is a movement the likes of which they\\'ve never seen before maybe anywhere but certainly in this country they\\'ve never seen anything like this before you came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers and you came for I mean look from wherever you came from there were a lot of you and they showed up on Election Day I\\'ll never forget a wonderful congressman from Tennessee they have early voting one of the earliest places great state Tennessee and he said he was in Pennsylvania with me great state and he said you know sir I\\'ve been doing this for a long time but I\\'ve never seen people like this show up for early voting people that haven\\'t voted in a long time because they didn\\'t see anybody they wanted to vote for said I\\'ve never seen it they have Trump banners and trumpets and drum buttons I\\'ve never seen and this great congressman said I don\\'t know sir but I can tell you one thing if the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting you\\'re gonna win by a lot and we won and we won by a lot our nation is stronger today than ever before we have the number-one economy on earth no economy is social we\\'re rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history and when we took over it was depleted we took over a depleted military it\\'s not depleted anymore I can tell you that our spirit is strong our stride is back and our stand is clear we are finally putting America first we\\'ve created six million new jobs since election day nobody would have thought that was possible more than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps [Music] and they\\'re happy they\\'re happy 123 thousand more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected think of that number and right now Ohio is the most successful it\\'s ever been in the history of our country thank you congratulations Ohio stand up Mike and you have a good governor I want to tell you good job Mike unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for african-americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded while Republicans are working everyday to build up our country the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart the Democrat Party is now being led by four left-wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear no one has paid a higher price for the far-left destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation\\'s inner cities they have paid a dear price you see what\\'s happening you see our inner cities we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years and it\\'s stolen money and it\\'s wasted money and it\\'s a shame [Applause] for decades these communities have been running Seleucid Li by Democrat politicians and it\\'s been total one party control of the inner cities for a hundred years it\\'s been one-party control and look at them we can name one after another but I won\\'t do that because I don\\'t want to be controversial we want no controversy the Democrat record is wonderful act and corruption and decay total decay the Democrats of tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence they\\'ve squeezed the blood out of them left-wing mayors and City Council\\'s have opposed school choice trapping children and failing in government schools left and right so many of these mayors right now you know where they are they\\'re in jail that\\'s where they are Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice [Music] but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders and these open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals drain public services and flood communities with poisonous drugs it\\'s tough enough and I want to thank by the way the country of Mexico they\\'ve got 21,000 soldiers on the border right now [Applause] I\\'m starting to like Mexico a lot they do a lot more for us than the Democrats do right and the numbers are way down you\\'ll see that way way down Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents they put foreign citizens before American citizens we\\'re not going to do that five hundred and seventy two people were murdered in Chicago last year [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] you must have a Democrat mayor do you have a Democrat mayor [Applause] [Applause] come on law enforcement Democrat mayor [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Cincinnati do you have a Democrat mayor [Applause] well that\\'s what happens you see there are thousands of people outside and I said I agree you know we set a new record tonight of this arena but we could get but we could get a few more on the floors a few more up here we could get in there outside where it\\'s a hundred degrees out and they weren\\'t able to let us do it and I said is that run by the Democrats the answer is yes I said so you got a lot of hot people outside but we broke the old time record so the homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador Honduras Guatemala I believe it\\'s higher than give me a give me a place that you think is pretty bad give me a place the guy says Afghanistan I believe it\\'s higher than Afghanistan in our country think of that I believe we\\'ll check the numbers and if we\\'re wrong they will tell us tomorrow it\\'ll be headlines Trump exaggerated I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan yet Democrats and they\\'ve run it for many years want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities no-good dope the conditions and Nancy Pelosi\\'s once great city of San Francisco are deplorable they\\'re deplorable to remember the word deplorable you remember when Hillary used the word deplorable she used two words she used deplorable and irredeemable right [Applause] and only being a politician for a few years I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable but it turned out to be deplorable deplorable was not a good day for Hillary crooked Hillary is a crooked one Lia\\'s drinkin [Applause] nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California what they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country it\\'s a shame the world is looking at it look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible horrible disgusting conditions look at San Francisco look at some of your other cities and then you have a governor you have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California we\\'ll pay for your health care we\\'ll pay for and then you wonder why so many people are coming up they\\'re coming up because with the hottest economic country in the world but they\\'re also coming up because you have people like that governor say come on up we\\'ll give you a health scare come who wouldn\\'t come up who wouldn\\'t come up how crazy is this how crazy is this schools health care today I have a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities that\\'s the way we should be doing and by the way you know they keep talking about oh the voters the voters the voters they want all sorts of security what about a thing called voter ID voter identification rob portman please work on that rapport up and you have a great senator would you please start working on that you see the response every place I go Rob please round voter ID they give you everything they can give you except like voter ID and the things that matter Republicans believe that a nation was care for its own citizens first our pledge to America\\'s workers has secured commitments to train more than 12 million Americans for the jobs of tomorrow you know who\\'s working very hard on that you probably never heard of her Ivanka Trump he\\'s working very hard she gave up a lot get a very easy life but she loves doing it she\\'s got over I think now 12 million people there teaching them the great companies of our country they\\'re teaching people how to do it and it\\'s an incredible thing to watch to give former prisoners a second chance at life we pass groundbreaking criminal justice reform that nobody could have passed except us [Applause] President Obama tried a lot of them tried they couldn\\'t get it passed I got it passed with a lot of help from liberals and conservatives and a lot of help and the biggest beneficiary is the african-american community biggest beneficiary [Applause] and something which a lot of people don\\'t talk about but we doubled the child tax credit doubled it and our tax plan also created nearly nine thousand Opportunity Zones hottest thing going providing massive new incentives for investment and job creation in distressed communities left together I put out a six minute video video Dok everything I found unacceptable about liberalism and the Democrat Party take your time take your time walk away doctor doctor in the house please [Applause] okay thank you very much thank you very much thank you thank you thank you doctor thank you [Applause] don\\'t forget it\\'s a hundred degrees in here that person\\'s been standing there for almost a day if you think about it a lot of you so I appreciate it and you know what did they\\'ll come back they\\'ll get a little something and they\\'ll come right back because there\\'s never been anything like this there\\'s never been anything right thank you incredible we established more than 300 opportunity zones in Ohio alone these are really working out incredibly well nationwide nearly eight million African Americans live in opportunity zones but every Democrat voted against them every single Democrat because they vote as a bloc it\\'s the only thing they do good they stick together their policies no good they\\'re lousy politicians but they stick together like glue [Applause] [Music] that\\'s the only thing they have going Democrats deliver poverty for their constituents and privilege for themselves Republicans deliver job safety and opportunity for all Americans and we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders and we\\'ll start off with a man who had a very very tough race for governor a lot of people joke they took like dogs they can\\'t breathe they can\\'t breathe this guy was running against a so-called star [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so that\\'s two protesters and tomorrow night the headline will be protesters protest you know what happened to the second one he looked at the guy in front of him and he said I\\'m out of here by that\\'s the way it works that\\'s the way it works I guess too bad but a man who really has done a fantastic job he campaigned so hard and this was a star right from the fields of the great Pocahontas who\\'s now lying and cheating her way to the presidency if possible she\\'s trying to win remember she defrauded people with her credentials she said she was Indian and I said that I have more Indian blood than she does and I have none I\\'m sorry [Applause] and we drove her crazy and we drove her crazy that\\'s a good thing not a bad thing and she went out and she had a blood test done and it came out 1,024 he says somewhere back there hundreds of years ago there may have been an Indian or it may have been a statistical Eric as a result of all which it was anyway but the guy was like from her group you wouldn\\'t be very happy right now and we have a man that campaigned so hard relentless and I came in we did a rally where we had people like this it was packed the day before the election and Mike DeWine won that election and he wanted easily Mike DeWine [Applause] and we have a man who\\'s running for governor of Kentucky again [Music] and he\\'s done an incredible job and you know did you ever hear sometimes you could do such a good job that not everybody appreciates it but they had a lot of problems with pensions and a lot of tremendous problems that a normal governor would never have been able to correct but when you correct it you make yourself a little bit less popular but he had no choice and they had no choice it\\'s a great great state and he has turned out to be a great great governor Matt Bevin and he\\'s running in November and because I like him so much Matt get a nice big arena ready we\\'re going to do a rally for you okay [Applause] and a man whose fantastic son is here tonight who I just met credible when I ran with him he was down I said you know rob portman down and then about four weeks later he was up by like 24 points I said what the hell did you do and you know what he did he does a great job that\\'s what he did senator rob portman [Applause] great guy and we have a few guys that these are warriors a couple of them you saw the other day they were questioning Bob Muller that was a beauty he was sharp was they he was sharpest attack and Steve Chabot and Brad Winston and Warren Davidson and Andy Barr and a man named Greg pence who happens to be a brother of somebody I know very well they have been with us through thick and thin has been mostly really good times because what we\\'ve done no other administration in the first two and a half years in history has done thank you fellas great job a couple of them gave a grilling they gave a grilling all they had to do is mention the facts that it was over and also the auditor of the great state of Ohio a man whose job I made much easier because you have money pouring in you have companies pouring in Keith Faber how is it giving the numbers are good Keith numbers are good right yeah the numbers are good Ohio Senate President Larry OPA Larry thank you great job nice time I like Larry Stein and you have a couple of people that are very very powerful I hear that office that I shudder Ohio Supreme Court justices Sharon Kennedy and Judy French thank you and please don\\'t recuse yourself because I gave you a nice welcome should I ever be before you I love judges when they see you for about two seconds and then you say oh that judge should be fair and then they said I\\'d like to recuse myself because 29 years ago I met Donald Trump I\\'d never have been in love you know we\\'ve been doing very well in the courts by the way if you see what we\\'ve been winning a lot of cases [Applause] we really happen you know we\\'ve now appointed 148 think of this federal judges 148 we\\'re gonna soon have within about two months Mitch McConnell the Senate Rob Portman has helped so much will soon be listen to this 179 percentage-wise it\\'s the second most we will never beat number one sadly we\\'ll never be number one so percentage-wise nobody\\'s ever seen anything like it and that\\'s because President Obama basically was not able for about three years to get his people in which is a shame and I came in I had 148 opening as I said he\\'s supposed to have none I said how many do we have 148 I said you gotta be kidding and we\\'ve all done a good job together up it\\'s been amazing with Mitch and you and everybody it\\'s been amazing so we\\'re going to be up to a within two months [Music] 179 federal judges that\\'s in two and a half years and what else two great Supreme Court judges great one and there\\'s only one person I think most of you must know this who percentage-wise has done better than me with judges tongue I\\'ll give you a hint he appointed 100% of the federal judges and 100% of the United States Supreme Court [Music] George Washington [Applause] that\\'s one record we\\'re not gonna be but I appointed many more than him so let\\'s take it that way many more I also want to introduce a friend of mine who\\'s done an incredible job she\\'s really something she has been incredible as a leader of the GOP she\\'s the chair and she\\'s my friend Jane Timken [Applause] and a man Bob Purdue Chuck you know Bob baggage so Bob I had to pick a campaign manager

picked them in they Bob badou chick and no matter what happened no matter how badly we were doing he said sir you\\'re gonna win Ohio easily I said but Bob we just lost the head of the GOP in Ohio he

Jr and Kimberly I hope he did a good job good I heard you did I heard you did a great job he\\'s been a great help they both have it thank you very much thank you Kimberly thank you very much our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker Pro jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100% pro-american we\\'ve eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations giving the average American household $3,000 board to spend every single year the previous administration tried to shut down American energy and close up totally closed it up American clean beautiful coal that\\'s what they did that didn\\'t work out too well but you had to suffer you know what it didn\\'t work out well but yet to suffer for a long time until I came along you\\'re not suffering any longer the previous administration they liked windmills you know windmills if a windmill is within two miles of your house your house is practically worthless they make noise they\\'re intermittent they kill your birds they break down all the time you have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out and they cost a fortune and they need subsidy other than that they\\'re quite good you don\\'t want to have admit you don\\'t want one of those windmills within vision you hear them they\\'re noisy got a lot of problems no we\\'re gonna stay with the great energy that\\'s powering our businesses that\\'s creating so many jobs and solar you know what will live with solar but solar is peanuts by comparison to what you need but we\\'re gonna stay the way we have it we\\'ve ended the war on American energy and we\\'re putting our coal miners back to work and our steel workers back to work and our auto companies back to work and you know we\\'ve learned over the last three years the incredible gold that we\\'re sitting on top of in this country we\\'re very lucky we\\'re now the largest energy producer in the entire world bigger than Soviet Union formerly remember the Soviet Union when it was all together the Soviet Union when it was all together before they decided we got to call ourselves Russia when it was all together they wanted to be that was always their dream to be the biggest in the world then it became Russia and you know what they\\'ve done a good job with energy and so has Saudi Arabia done a good job with energy but we are now bigger than Russia we are now bigger than Saudi Arabia by far [Music] and I was drew our country from the job-killing very expensive Paris climate Accord [Music] [Applause] last year call exports were up 92 percent compared to 2060 92 percent do you believe that you shipping it all over the world to Vietnam I was in Vietnam and they said we get called from Ohio we get called from West Virginia to find his call in the world we\\'ve created more than 110,000 new mining jobs and thanks to states like Ohio the United States is now the number one producer of oil the number one producer of natural gas the number one everything having to do with energy number 1 anywhere in the world we\\'re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that let other countries to pillage our jobs plunder our factories and devastate Ohio communities and communities in every state the era of economic surrender is over [Applause] you look at what they\\'ve done to your jobs over a period of time NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made and probably the worse deal you still have empty buildings empty factories but now they\\'re getting filled up pretty fast for being knocked down four brand new ones we have hundreds of new companies pouring into the United States my first week in office I would through the United States from one of the last administrations worst sellouts it would have destroyed our automobile industry it would have destroyed manufacturing in this country and maybe that\\'s what President Obama meant when he said you can\\'t produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States because he would have signed trans-pacific partnership and it would have been right I killed it [Music] and by the way TPP trans-pacific partnership would have destroyed the automobile industry in this country already they shipped down 30% of your jobs to Mexico under the new u.s. MCA that\\'s Mexico and Canada we got to get them to vote on that because that\\'s incredible deal but under the new it\\'s going to be very hard for companies to leave you to fire you to go down to make their product whatever it may be to send it back into the United States with no tax while we end up with this unemployment and taxes and empty buildings so they got a voter in the u.s. MCA before I took office foreign countries ripped us off robbed us blind and push this around but America is not being pushed around anymore do you realize that [Applause] I think I got that from working in Ohio for two summers right we\\'ve taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China straight up years and I just announced another 10% tariff on three hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese products that come into our country [Applause] and that\\'s on top of the 25% that we take of two hundred and fifty billion dollars coming in from China and don\\'t let them tell you the fact is China devalues their currency their pour money into their system they pour it in and because they do that you\\'re not paying for those tariffs China\\'s paying for those Saros [Applause] for the last 20 years China\\'s taken hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of our country and now we\\'re stopping the theft of American jobs we\\'re stopping the theft of so many other things happening including intellectual property they steal our intellectual property and you know I think they want to try and make a deal with us but I\\'m not sure because the word is I feel they want to wait till they get older praying they\\'re praying they would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they could continue to rip off the United States like they\\'ve been doing for the last 25 years they would love to see a guy like sleepy Joe Biden who has no clue what the hell he\\'s doing [Music] they say the sleepy Joe sure just sign right there okay all signs we\\'ve been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China it has to stop but they understand that President Xi is good man he\\'s a friend of mine he understands it and until such time as there is a deal we will be taxing the hell out of China that\\'s all there is [Applause] if foreign countries don\\'t want to pay a tariff I have a simple solution make your product in America come on back to the United States come on back to Ohio there\\'s no tariff is no tariff thanks to steel tariffs hundreds of thousands of tons think of this were dumped on our shores and steel is like something else it\\'s not quality they were dumping garbage they call it sand steel they called it dirt steel it was mixed up it was bad stuff and we didn\\'t want to use that for our jet fighters and for our beams that hold up building but they were dumping tremendous quantities of steel and what was happening is United States steel and all of our companies were going virtually out of business and I stopped it I put on a 25% tariff billions of dollars is now pouring into our treasury and our steel companies and our steel workers are coming back right here in Ohio new car a great steel company and a steel company that\\'s doing great again Nucor has announced an 85 million dollar upgrade in Marion shorter seal announced plans to build a new 150 million dollares steel mill in Cuyahoga Heights and Cleveland cliffs announced a new 700 million dollar plant in a very good place that I like a lot toledo toledo on [Applause] and this was unthinkable because four years ago steel plants were closing they weren\\'t expanding and they weren\\'t building we\\'re building new plants in Florida North Carolina South Carolina all over not just Ohio on issue after issue Democrats have forgotten who it is that they\\'re supposed to represent they forgot I wonder why they forgot the job of elected officials is to represent American citizens the Radical Democrats even support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals onto our straight sanctuary cities and many of the places that have sanctuary cities and many of the people that live there they don\\'t want them they don\\'t want them they\\'re dangerous they\\'re not good here are just a few examples in San Francisco an illegal alien was arrested no fewer than 10 times in the span of less than one year for numerous counts of burglary and theft yet each time San Francisco defied federal authorities and set him free and bad things happened when they set him free a sanctuary jurisdiction in California recently released a criminal alien from jail the very next month the same individual was arrested for rape and then beyond anything you would even believe a horrible thing happened but yet again he was released back into your community after a sanctuary city in New Jersey release an alien charged with domestic violence he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people in the bizarre world view of the 3rd and hard left they have no problem destroying the lives of innocent Americans for a single politically incorrect thought but they wanted virtually and you know this you know this they want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed crimes and murder horrible crimes and Republicans believe our cities should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not criminal aliens and yes we just won a big lawsuit last week fact one of my lawyers but winning that lawsuit is here tonight I gave him a little reprieve we need a lot of lawyers in the white house we get sued so much so unfairly but we\\'re winning those lawsuits left and right but one of them is here he said I\\'d love to go to a rally I said I\\'m going to a place called Cincinnati Ohio you deserve it we just won the lawsuit on the wall we just won the lawsuit on the wall you hear that and we\\'re building the wall faster and better that have it\\'s time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities and catch-and-release you know what you do you catch them and then you release them and you say would you please report back in four years from now but only two percent come back you know why because they\\'d have the smartest they are not this one they\\'re the ones we don\\'t want to have come back only two percent show up catch and release we could end it immediately if the Democrats gave so what we\\'re doing is something else would keeping them out altogether we\\'re replacing random migration and we\\'re replacing the lottery system how about the lottery system how about lotteries this was Chuck Schumer you put the name in a basket the country puts the name in the basket and you pick people out of the lottery well let\\'s see this one\\'s a murderer this one robbed four banks this one I better not say skip this one another murderer ladies and gentlemen another murderer think of this do you think they\\'re gonna put their great citizens ain\\'t great citizens they\\'ve great people like we have great people do you think those people are going into a lottery no and then we get these people coming in and we hold it against the country the country is AB a star that the country you just take a look look at the people they put into these lotteries it\\'s a disgrace and how we\\'ve done this for so many years folks just how we\\'ve done this it\\'s an immigration system that\\'s totally broken and we\\'re going to win the house we\\'re going to win the Senate we\\'re going to win the presidency and we\\'re gonna do a merit-based immigration system Mary merit-based immigration and we need that because we have companies coming in from all over the world and we need good workers we need good people we\\'re down to three point five percent unemployment we need people but we want people to come in based on merit not based on some lottery put in by a government Democrats have never been farther outside the mainstream liberal politicians want to eliminate private health care and force everyone onto the government plan remember the lies from the previous administration if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor 28 times one lie after another 28 times that was said and it turned out to be a total lie my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and doctor that is best for you we\\'re offering right now plans up to 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion and then you\\'ll have like a governor of Virginia it\\'s not only late term abortion it\\'s killing the baby after the baby is born [Applause] think of that think of that that\\'s why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child as a sacred gift from God Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and there the party frankly of socialism the Republican Party is the party of freedom we\\'re the party of the American worker the American family were the party of the American dream I\\'m fighting for you each and every day I had a great life I used to get great publicity nobody got better public I had such a great life it was so easy my great wife the first lady Melania she said she said you know you\\'ve always been a hard worker you love to work but your life was a lot easier in the old days but I love it and you know why I love it because we\\'re accomplishing so much nobody ever thought it would be possible to do the things even a thing like right to try right right to try they\\'ve been trying to get that for years and years and years that\\'s people that are really sick terminally ill they couldn\\'t get medicine we have the greatest doctors the greatest clinics the greatest technicians in the world they couldn\\'t get anything that traveled to Asia if they had money they\\'d travel to Europe to travel all over the world hoping for a cure if they had no money to just go home they\\'d die they had no hope for 44 years they\\'ve been trying to get right to try we are so advanced in medicine we have a lot of things that probably work or possibly work but we weren\\'t allowed legally to give that to these people that were so sick you know why because they didn\\'t want this drug if it didn\\'t work to hurt the people but the people were terminally ill so I got it approved and it wasn\\'t easy it was complicated the insurance companies didn\\'t want to do it the government didn\\'t want to do it the doctors didn\\'t want to do tremendous liability but our country didn\\'t want to do it they say well if it doesn\\'t work we\\'re gonna get sued I say so they\\'ll sign an agreement very strong one-page taking a liability away from the United States from the drug companies from the doctors all liability that terminally ill let\\'s try it and you know what it\\'s been a miracle so many people have done so well we got it done when I said about the agreement they had these great lawyers and they said gee that\\'s a good idea they\\'ve been working at this for years they said that\\'s a good idea I said yeah it\\'s a good idea how about getting it to me like at about two hours right to try it\\'s a great thing but we have so many things like that I have lists that you wouldn\\'t even believe I have lists that go on for pages of things we\\'ve done we\\'ve launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs including a plan to allow companies to import lower-cost drugs from other countries [Music] it\\'s a very unfair system our country pays the highest prices in the world last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down now we\\'re gonna break it down by a lot we\\'re gonna bring it down a lot and now so other countries here\\'s an example Canada pays half the price for a lot of drugs that we do so we have a great governor in the state of Florida Rhonda says calls me up doing a great job Rhonda Santha he was at three and he went to 17 that\\'s a pretty good increase right Rhonda sands is a great governor and he comes too because you know if you buy the drugs if we buy the drugs because this is so bunched up we have a middleman it\\'s a it\\'s not a good situation he said if I could go and buy the drugs from Canada I could save 50 percent I said do it do it and if you can buy him from Europe because the resistant like remember I used to scream when I was winning states and not getting the delegates that I was entitled to and I\\'d say the system is rigged well the drug system is rigged it\\'s rigged so if we can buy the same drug made by the same pharmaceutical company from Europe or from Canada or from other places at a big deep discount we\\'re doing it and we\\'re giving them the right to do just happen today now we\\'re doing one other thing that Believe It or Not is even bigger but you\\'ll be seeing that over the next two weeks with the help of your great Senator Rob Portman we\\'ve taken bold action to confront the opioid epidemic and in Ohio drug overdose deaths went down 22% last year 22% but think of that hope you a big problem big problem deaths went down opioid does 22% nobody writes that nobody talks about that they don\\'t want to talk about that good job Rob good job good job Mike we passed V a choice and VA accountability on behalf of our great veterans [Applause] they\\'ve been trying to pass VA choice for four decades they couldn\\'t get it done we got it done we got it done this is where a veteran would stand on line four three four five six days for three weeks for five weeks sometimes they\\'re okay by the time they see a doctor they\\'re terminally ill and I said you know I have a great idea because I\\'ve not been doing that this long you know this has been we\\'ve been working with this for I\\'ve been thinking about it a lot this was during the campaign what a campaign that was right was that a campaign or what and I came back to my people at experts and I said I have a great idea these lines for the veterans are too long it takes them three four weeks sometimes to see doctor I have a great idea let\\'s let them go outside go to a private doctor we\\'ll pay the bill they\\'ll be fixed up or perfect and they can do it immediately we\\'ll pay the bill and I thought I said man am i smart I am the smartest guy to think of that so I went before this panel of experts that were with me working on things and I said how do you like that idea and they said sir we\\'ve known about it for about 40 years but we\\'ve never been I said really you\\'ve known about it that long but here\\'s the thing we got it done nobody else could get it done and accountability you couldn\\'t fire anybody if they were treating our vets badly you couldn\\'t fire him for anything people could steal they could be sadistic to our vets by the way they wouldn\\'t have done that in prime time to our vets I can tell you that they could be whatever they want you couldn\\'t fire him and it was because of unions that it was because of other things civil service very tough you couldn\\'t fire anybody from us anything we had cases where people got they got caught stealing a lot of money and you couldn\\'t fire them we got VA accountability now we say Jim get the hell out of here you\\'re fired we\\'re rebuilding our military and after years of budget cuts and layoffs the army tank plant in do you know Lima you call it Lima right say you know most people call it Lima but I know lime but you know why because I came here and they said we\\'re closing this plant I said what kind of a plant is it remember when I was here in Lima and I used to say you mean Lima they said no sir it\\'s Lima that\\'s why because but Lea hey look I\\'ll be honest we did because they haven\\'t wrong with the teleprompter okay and I would have been in big trouble but the good news is I don\\'t use the teleprompter too much if I did you would have been out of here a long time ago because it gets very boring when you do the teleprompter deal but in Lima and I said what kind of a plant that I said let\\'s go see it during the campaign I went to see it and they make the incredible the best army tank in the world and I couldn\\'t believe the complexity the genius I said wait a minute you closed this you\\'ll never be able to open it again you can\\'t open this this isn\\'t like a normal situation that you can open four walls in a roof this is complicated this is genius and you\\'ll never replace these men and women that work here I said and I didn\\'t know anything at the time other than I said you\\'re not closing it they took it off the list they kept it open and now we\\'re making army tanks around the try we\\'re investing in the future of human spaceflight Americans won the race of the moon and we will now win the race to Mars [Applause] it\\'s going to be amazing and you know one thing I have to say also and we\\'re also winning the race - great great strategic defense and defense not just Mars and Mike Pence is doing a great job on the great job to protect America\\'s security I would through the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal a horrible stupid deal we gave around a hundred and fifty billion dollars we gave a read one point eight billion dollars in cash plane loads of cash I wonder what they saw when those planes landed I wonder what happened to the cash can you believe it one point eight billion dollars we gave them in cash [Applause] and remember what I said Iran is a much different country than two-and-a-half years ago when I took over Iran was all over they had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction they were all over and now they just want to know they want to negotiate a deal so badly Iran Iran I recognized Israel\\'s through capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and just a few months ago we recognized the Golan Heights you know that that\\'s another one big one for the security of Israel we also recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela and we condemn any of the socialist brutality taking place let\\'s see what happens there let\\'s see what happened tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country never ever ever will it be a socialist country no matter what label they use they vote for any Democrat in 2020 as a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of our great our beautiful our wonderful American dream we\\'re not going to let our country ever go down the route of socialism [Applause] you must never forget that\\'s a 2020 election is about one thing it\\'s about you I say it again I say it all the time never happened before there\\'s never been a movement like this they\\'ve had movements they never went they want a state they did well in the state we won 32 states there\\'s never been anything like it [Applause] [Music] but this movement is about your family and your future and it\\'s about the life and the fate of your country we begin our oh hi look this is a good places this is a great thing to do we begin our campaign and we\\'re going to do great Bob right Bob Bob if we don\\'t do great you\\'re fired

better today than it\\'s ever ever ever done before it\\'s the best it\\'s ever done [Applause] so what\\'s gonna do a guy like a sleepy Jill Biden is going to come in and say but I could do better I could do better he wants to go back to sleep together we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise so every American can reach their fullest and highest potential tremendous potential

[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you very much everybody thank you wow I will never ever let you down that I can tell you and I want to thank Manchester and New Hampshire a very special you remember those primaries that primary came around and remember what happened during the primary Trump should come in third or fourth and we came in easily number one and that was the beginning that was an easy one I want to thank you all this is incredible and it\\'s great to be back in a state that I love with thousands of hard-working Patriots who are the heart and soul of America and this would and we\\'re actually here today to officially launch our campaign to win the great state of New Hampshire in 2020 and I saw some fake polls put out by the fake news media and I said that I\\'m tied I\\'m tied with three of the other candidates the Democrats I\\'m tied in New Hampshire I don\\'t think so I\\'ve been making [Applause] one of them as the rallies got a hundred people so this holds 12,000 we\\'re full and we could fill it up four times at least we could fill it up four times but I just want to thank you all I just think it\\'s going to be a tremendous four years we\\'re gonna have a tremendous four years can you believe it we only have a little more than a year to go where it all started right the greatest movement in the history of our country the greatest political movement in the history of our country and even though we had fake witch hunts on our back and all the other things that we had to go through we have taken this big beautiful ship and it\\'s being turned around very quickly three years ago we campaigned across the country on a pledge to make America great again and that\\'s exactly what we\\'ve done I think we can honestly say it\\'s the greatest slogan in the history of politics in America make America great again so if you don\\'t mind you know the other candidates go they spend millions and millions of dollars on this question that I\\'m gonna ask you they spend millions you remember the first slogan from our opponent that\\'s right neither do I neither this head nobody remembers the only thing I remember is the first night I went out after I heard it and I said see it\\'s all about her and they immediately changed it after spending like a million dollars they said it\\'s all about her that didn\\'t work out too well that slogan wasn\\'t too good so we have to do this we have to make a decision do you give up the greatest slogan in the history of politics in our country making America great again right so do we give up make America great again for a new slogan because look our country is doing great we are doing very well with China despite the fact that they want to have you believe to the contrary all you have to do is say China how you doing they\\'re not too happy and not too happy they\\'re losing millions of jobs the tariffs are working and they\\'re eating the tariffs by the way there\\'s no price increase you know you got to talk to these people the fake news but do we give up and by the way the biggest beneficiary you know have been great our great farmers have been so incredible because they\\'ve been targeted by China and frankly they\\'ve been targeted for a long time including by incompetent politicians that have run this country for a long time so we\\'re making up for a lot of lost ground but do we give up make America great again for Keep America great [Applause] okay you ready ready I love this because it\\'s free and we have all the time in the world right is there anything better than a Trump rally what about a sleepy Joe Biden rally [Applause] [Applause] all right why he\\'s made some beauties I sorta hope it\\'s him I don\\'t mind any of them you got Pocahontas is rising [Applause] you got Kabbalah Kamala is falling you got Vado bado is like gone [Applause] but we\\'ll see what happens whoever you know whoever it is I don\\'t know that it matters but whoever it is different different people but I don\\'t know I think sleepy Joe may be able to limp across the finish line I think but today they announced that they\\'re going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster they\\'re gonna have fewer appearances you\\'ve heard that right this is sir they\\'re gonna cut way back on his appearances can you believe it if I ever did that it would be over the fake news would get us but we don\\'t let him get us and it is faked and today the deputy editor of the New York Times was demoted is that beautiful all the news that\\'s not fit to print you know all the news the fake fairly New York Times so why do I go with what do we go you know it\\'s really we it\\'s not me I\\'m we\\'re doing it together they came from the hills they came from the mountains from the rivers from they came from all over the place and they showed up and they voted like nobody\\'s seen before and it was 306 to 223 remember and we won Wisconsin and they said oh we never thought of that got to think about those things and we won Michigan and now we have a lot of car companies coming into Michigan and we have a lot of great farming events happening really big in Wisconsin and we have incredible things going on in Pennsylvania we just opened up a ten billion dollar plant we have many of them going up they have a lot of jobs spending ten in Louisiana an LNG plant ten billion dollars could never have happened could never have happened Pennsylvania would have never happened they wouldn\\'t have loud him to frack so they would have never been able to build it but what a place that is it\\'ll be open in a little more than a year but I have to make a decision it\\'s a big decision do we give up the greatest theme phrase logo whatever you want to call it and the history of politics risky for a brand new one because make America great again we\\'re really sort of there and we have a little time left and now we have a group of socialists or communists could be they\\'re not far away now the fake news will hit me on that how dare he say that but they\\'re not far away right they\\'re not far away 95% does anybody want to pay 95 percent tax on oil I don\\'t think so so but I\\'m not going to go into their plan because as far as I\\'m concerned the green New Deal is a beautiful thing no it\\'s a beautiful thing we wanted to continue onward until about a month before the election I will let them have it like you\\'ve never heard before I don\\'t want it to change it\\'s like Elizabeth Warren I did the Pocahontas thing I hit her really hard and it looked like she was down and out but that was too long ago I should have waited but don\\'t worry we will revive it it can be revived it can be rewrite it will be revived and it can be revived very easily and very quickly and we\\'re gonna have some fun in the state of New Hampshire now what do we do ready let me have first make America great again then Keep America great right just applaud like crazy for the one you want to use for this campaign and there\\'s a possibility we\\'ll use both there\\'s a possibility we\\'ll use both because I hate like hell I hate like hell to give up the one is there a possibility we use both maybe one a little bit less are you ready so we\\'ll start make America great again and then keep American ok are you ready who\\'s in favor of the campaign theme being make America great again who\\'s in favor of our theme being Keep America great [Applause] so oh wait a minute this is your hand please I was gonna keep it actually thank you thank you so that\\'s really been the reaction I\\'ve done this before big crowds and it really is Keep America great because we have these socialists want to take it away from us they want to take it away so it works because until a couple of days ago and that will catch up very quickly we have no choice by the way I never said China was going to be easy but it\\'s not tough and they want to make a deal we just spoke to them yesterday they want to make a deal they want to make a deal I have to make a deal and you know what it\\'d be wonderful to make a deal I don\\'t think we\\'re ready to make a deal would take it in billions of dollars in tariffs and and again China\\'s devaluing their currency they\\'re pouring out money the prices haven\\'t gone up so that means we take it in billions of dollars we\\'re not paying for it and ultimately they\\'re devaluations are going to hurt them very badly they want to make a deal and they should want to make a deal but when you listen to the fake news look at how many there are that son [Applause] I mean I actually had something today I had something today are we sure that we\\'re in New Hampshire you know you have a reputation I mean I know it\\'s not true cuz I know you do well you have a reputation the big very staid very very elegant state incredible people you\\'re not acting it tonight and that\\'s good that\\'s a good thing we we love our country we have enthusiasm for our country but that\\'s what it is that\\'s why that\\'s what it is before the election our factories were closing hey who knows it better than you you\\'re like central casting for the closing of factories our jobs were vanishing our military was totally depleted when I took over our military was said we weren\\'t flying half of our planes they were old they were tired our equipment was tired our people weren\\'t tired though our people weren\\'t tired but everything we had it was depleted now we\\'ve rebuilt our military like never before and all made in the USA to say you know and our nation was weakened at home and disrespected abroad they don\\'t disrespect us anymore folks I got NATO to pay an extra hundred billion dollars they weren\\'t paying they were delinquent many nations were except for seven many nations weren\\'t paying what they were supposed to be paying so we\\'re supposed to protect them they\\'d kill us on trade they have all sorts of barriers and everything else the taxes are really unfair the tariffs were ridiculous what they do to us in Europe and then we protect them that they don\\'t pay and I say I\\'m sorry folks you have to pay you have to pay they were delinquent they were delinquent and my biggest fan is Secretary General Stoltenberg from NATO he said until President Trump came along we were going boom they would have been finished very quickly but I\\'m tired of paying for other nations anyway I have to be honest with and today our nation is stronger than ever before we\\'re now stronger than ever before you saw we ended the Iran disaster how about that we paid him 150 billion dollars 1.8 billion in cash cash cash cash we got nothing and they also want to make a deal China wants to make a deal and I will tell you Iran wants to make a deal because the sanctions are not good for them they are not happy so we\\'ll see how it all turns out but it\\'s a good hands it\\'s a good news the United States right now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world we\\'re rebuilding [Music] that awesome mite that we were just talking about our United States Armed Forces America is working again America is winning again and America is respected again respected like never before they respect us again and you say it you know recent poll came out where it showed that President Obama was more popular in Germany and other places than I am and I said of course he\\'s more popular he\\'s not demanding that they pay for their protection that we provide he\\'s not doing that I\\'m doing that and in fact if I was the most popular I\\'m not doing my job right okay so true we\\'ve created over 6 million new jobs since the election if I would have said that during the campaign those people back there would have been headlines headlines more than 7 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps since my election the number of new businesses starting in the great state of New Hampshire has skyrocketed by almost 25 percent and you can\\'t really go by my election you got to go by November 9th because you know the markets have gone through the roof since November 9th that\\'s the day after I won the election so I won the election the markets run up thousands of points things started happening you started doing things that you would have never even though I didn\\'t get sworn in until January 20th but they refused to do that and let me tell you if for some reason I wouldn\\'t have won the election these markets would have crashed and that\\'ll happen even more so in 2020 see the bottom line is I know you liked me and this room is a love fest I know that but you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401ks down the tubes everything\\'s going to be down the tubes so whether you love me or hate me you got a vote for me I had a businessman the other day one of the most successful guys in the country I\\'ve never liked him never liked him he never liked me I never liked him I see him in the White House I said what are you doing here he said I\\'m working to make sure you get elected I said you gotta be kidding you don\\'t like me I don\\'t like you what the hell is this all about he said that\\'s right we\\'ve had our differences I haven\\'t liked you but to be honest with you mr. president I have no choice I said you\\'re right you\\'re right first thing I\\'ve ever heard him say that I agreed with he\\'s got no choice we got no choice unemployment in New Hampshire has reached the lowest rate in actually 31 years but within a very short period of time it will be the lowest rate in the history of our country so think of that you have the best unemployment you have the most successful stay in the history of your state and in the history of our country and then you\\'re gonna vote for somebody else oh great let\\'s vote for Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren [Applause] we have the best numbers we\\'ve ever had let\\'s vote for somebody else I don\\'t think that\\'s gonna happen folks I don\\'t think that\\'s gonna happen only with fixed polls does that happen unemployment for african-americans you\\'ve heard me say this many times I\\'m very proud of it Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country wages are rising quickly remember when I used to say people have been working two and three jobs making less money than they made 21 years ago I used to say it all the time now I can say for the first time in 20 years wages are rising and you know who\\'s the biggest beneficiary blue-collar workers my administration is fighting to expand opportunity for citizens of every background and every race religion color and Creed very important because we are all Americans we all share the same home we all share the same heart we all share the same dreams we are all children of the same Almighty God but at the very moment when our country should be coming together to enjoy these wonderful blessings the Radical Democrats are trying to tear America apart they vilify anyone who doesn\\'t share their extreme views they slander our law enforcement heroes you see what they\\'re doing with our police that we love you see what they\\'re doing has anyone ever seen anything like the water being thrown on New York\\'s finest have you ever seen [Music] [Applause] and I know a lot of New York\\'s finest they\\'re not happy they\\'re not happy and they are great people these are great great proud people for that to be allowed to happen is a disgrace they view everybody is fascists and Nazis they used the term Nazi this was a term you couldn\\'t even use it now they used it like on a regular basis at Nazi he\\'s a Nazi think of that he\\'s a Nazi you couldn\\'t use it now they use it they accuse our heroic border agents of running concentration camps and they do an incredible job and the Democrats don\\'t want to fix the loopholes or asylum they do an incredible job of border agents and they look down upon the hard-working citizens who truly make our country run but while the Democrats rage and regions [Applause] that guy\\'s got a serious weight problem go home start exercising get him out of here please [Applause] got a bigger problem than I do got a bigger problem than all of us now he goes home and his mom says what the hell have you just got we are continuing our incredible movement the greatest political movement in the history of our country there\\'s never been a movement like this never our movement is built on love and it is and we love our family we love our faith we love our flag and we love our freedom and that\\'s what it\\'s about and there too that the fact that we love our neighbors and we love our country together we are all united by one fundamental principle a nation\\'s first duty must always be to its own citizens its own we\\'re gonna take care of you haven\\'t heard that from a politician or a political leader in a long time it\\'s called America first it\\'s America we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by many tremendous Republican leaders and great friends of mine a man who\\'s doing an incredible job as your governor because I want to take a hundred percent of the credit for the incredible turnaround of New Hampshire and I remember it not so long ago things were not looking good people were leaving a lot of bad things were happening but we have to give him a lot of credit he\\'s been a great governor Chris Sununu with a great father - great father with a great father his father was tough Chris your father was so tough he was for somebody else in the primers and then one by one I went here I won there one day and then when I won his father got her and I said oh this guy kills me he\\'s so tough and he said President Trump will be the greatest of all time he said I said what happened what happened he went from being the toughest critic to the best there is so I want to say hello to your father okay Chris you\\'ll tell him great guy what a family what a family thank you for New Hampshire Senate Republican leader Chuck Morse New Hampshire House Republican leader dick hinge thanks thank you dick Thank You dick great job a man who is with me right from the beginning in

for a big big fat beautiful profit where is Steve Steve stepanak and his wife was incredible did you make a lot of money in the house and we destroyed the house this was the beginning he held some kind of a meeting for me and he has the nice house but literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up and they destroyed this house it\\'s never been the same no wonder you sold it

mcdaniel you know Rana headed up Michigan and for many many years nobody won Michigan is a Republican but I used to complain and you know just I\\'d go there and I\\'d say they\\'re stealing you car business I go for years in fact five or six years before I even thought about running for whatever reason they named me Man of the Year in Michigan I said how come I didn\\'t even understand it myself but I was named Man of the Year I wasn\\'t even political that was years before I did this but I was always complaining that our car business is being stolen I mean it\\'s sort of obvious right Mexico now has 32 percent of our car business at all left the state of Michigan we are bringing it back at a level that nobody\\'s ever seen before our car person but but I went to Michigan and my opponent was sold that the Republicans no way you can win Michigan or Wisconsin that you just can\\'t and we had a campaign manager\\'s name Ronna McDaniel and Ronna wouldn\\'t stop sir can you be here next week I say I don\\'t know then I leave and she said sir can you come back in three days I said I don\\'t know then I do it and she said how about another time and then on election night she said sir who was six o\\'clock the day before the election in other words just a short while before the election she calls me sure can you be here tonight I said tonight and by the way you know where I was I was in New Hampshire she said sir can you be here tonight I said are you sure I started speaking at one o\\'clock in the morning now it\\'s election day we had 32,000 people show up it was like this the crowd was just they want to see things happen in our country they loved our country it went crazy and I left and I said I don\\'t know why we\\'re gonna lose Michigan why would we lose Michigan look at this and the opponent went there with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama and she went there much earlier primetime 1 o\\'clock 2 o\\'clock in the mornings not exactly prime time so we had 32,000 and they had a tiny little crowd and I looked at my people and I say I know we\\'re not supposed to win the great state of Michigan but I think we\\'re gonna win Michigan and we won Michigan and we won Wisconsin we won Miss concert Wisconsin was a great victory and we won Pennsylvania and we won North Carolina and South Carolina and we won Florida and I hate to tell you we should have won New Hampshire that was taken away New Hampshire was taken away it was taken away from us but we should have we did great in New Hampshire we should have won New Hampshire but that\\'s okay I\\'m not holding it against you because it was not your fault but we had a woman in Michigan and I said when it came time to choosing the head of the Republican National Committee I said who the hell is that woman up and Michigan that got me to keep coming there and explaining that we can\\'t continue to lose our car business we have 17 companies now coming back in who is that woman and it was Rana we put her in charge of the Republican National Committee the job that she has done is incredible thank you and the same with another man our campaign manager he started off as a computer genius and remember when they used to say that the Hillary Clinton campaign is highly sophisticated hi Lisa [Applause] she did a lot of bad things folks 33,000 emails deleted after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress 33 pounds remember she said it was about her daughter\\'s wedding and yoga classes 33000 yes [Applause] it was disgraceful I will tell you this we now have a great Attorney General a fair guy great gentleman so another manners here tonight is the world\\'s tallest campaign manager he is an unbelievable talent but they were saying about our opponent I\\'m not going to mention the name again because I\\'ll never get my will never get it finished here so I\\'ll just say my opponent is that better and and they were saying how sophisticated her campaign was except ours was far more sophisticated and we had a man that did an incredible job and he\\'s now our campaign manager and he\\'s one of the tallest human beings I\\'ve ever seen and his name is Brad parse Cal and he is it\\'s nice when you don\\'t have to look for anybody you just look over and you see a guy who\\'s twice as tall as everyone great job Brad thank you how we doing Brad good got great poll numbers we got great poll numbers in a lot of states Ohio Iowa you know Iowa every week that they campaign our numbers go up they\\'re winning Iowa we gave a methanol which is very important a lot of things for Iowa but every week received to be going up in Iowa because they\\'re campaigning and Iowa wherever they go our numbers go up somebody\\'s gonna have to explain that one to me someday but we like it a man who\\'s a friend of mine who was the greatest mayor in the history of New York City [Applause] whoo stand up Rudy Rudy Julia man he did a job he did a job and the first year I\\'ve never seen anything like it New York was crime-infested we had problems we had problems like nobody would believe and Rudy went in there and he did the job and people loved him for it it wasn\\'t like oh gee he\\'s a horrible person people loved Rudy Giuliani he was a great great mayor so Thank You Rudy for being here and the first person that I put on on the campaign he was driving me wild he said I\\'m saying you could win sir you can win I\\'m telling you you can win he loves her state he\\'s from this state he said you can win sir I\\'m just telling you and I had him on for month after month he come drive me crazy so you can win you can win you can win and finally we said let\\'s give it a shot and I had Corey I had hope I had just a couple of people we had a rather lean and mean staff but Corey Lewandowski loves your state loves New Hampshire he was the first one that talked about us possibly winning the whole big ballgame and he\\'s tough and he\\'s smart and I\\'m hearing he\\'s thinking about running for the Senate from New Hampshire I think it\\'d be tough to beat I\\'ll tell you one thing he\\'ll go into Washington and he\\'s gonna have you in mind he\\'s gonna do a job if he does do it so we\\'ll see what happens he hasn\\'t made up his mind yet but he would be he would be fantastic and I guess it\\'s something you go back and you talk to your family you talk to your wife and you make a decision they\\'re all saying are you gonna support him I said I don\\'t know if he\\'s running so Cory let us know please let us know our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker pro-jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100% pro-american for decades and decades the permanent politicians in Washington pursued the very opposite they sold out our workers you see it you know it better than any place when I talk about the horrors of NAFTA the horrors of trade deals I mean I\\'m sorry to tell you this I usually refer to New Hampshire nobody took it worse than New England and nobody took it worse than New Hampshire now here\\'s the good news I would never let that happen again and Chris will never let that happen again is there a doctor please doctor in the house thank you doctor in the house please doctor please thank you very much take your time take your time [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Music] take your time fellas plenty of time [Music] you know people got here two and a half days ago many of these people in the front two and a half two and a half days ago a lot of these people so you can understand it\\'s pretty tough thank you [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] that\\'s okay [Applause] these are great people these are great people that love our country [Music] [Applause] thank you very much thank you thank you very much pretty good pretty good so while politicians shipped away our jobs shed our sovereignty surrendered our dignity and saddled our nation in one foreign debacle after another and we\\'re still here eat yourself we\\'re still here you better believe it and we\\'re here stronger than ever before we here but all of that ended the day that I took the oath of office the American people are in charge of their country again we\\'ve got a record number of job-killing regulations they were strangling our country we cut more regulations in two and a half years than any other president in their full terms four years eight years or in one case more than that cut more than anybody to get relief to working families we passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms in the history of our country you\\'re making a lot more money you may get a lot more money and you see it and you know it because you see it in your paycheck every week we ended last administration\\'s cool war on American energy and we are delivering a policy of American energy independence like you\\'ve never seen before and in fact if you look at the Straits where we\\'re having all of the problems you look at the Straits number one they\\'re not touching our ships that are playing with our ships they\\'re taking them from this country from that country from that country but you know what very importantly we have very few ships going there anymore because we don\\'t need that oil and gas and the United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world every leading Democrat has pledged to abolish the American oil coal and natural gas industries that are fueling our economic boom can you imagine this we\\'re sitting on great wealth they want to take it away from us and the alternatives don\\'t have the power they don\\'t have the power they want wind wind wind is oh so beautiful as long as you don\\'t have to stare at a windmill and your house goes down and value like to nothing Steve have you had a windmill anywhere near your house you would have gotten one-third the price you got Steve that\\'s true by the way Steve\\'s too smart to let that happen we won\\'t let them take it away from you we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that shattered New Hampshire and your factories they shattered your communities and they shattered American power and American prestige all around the globe New Hampshire lost one in four manufacturing jobs following NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization two of the worst deals ever in the history of our world not just our country election after election politicians came to your state pretending to have the courage to stand up for the American worker then they went to Washington and let other countries push them around and special interests buy them off and steal your jobs and take your companies what happened me I don\\'t care about their campaign contributions it doesn\\'t matter to me folks we want to do a job we want to do a great job and we\\'re setting records and you know who sending us the money the small donors we have big donors but we have small donors are sending us the money for the election pretty amazing that\\'s not supposed to happen to a Republican but it\\'s happening to this Republic and it\\'s happening to you every vow that politicians made was broken every hope was dashed and every promise turned into a total betrayal of New Hampshire and of our country but in this administration we have something those sellout politicians could only dream of it\\'s called strength and commitment we don\\'t play games we don\\'t play games after years and years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country standing up for our jobs our workers and standing up for our dignity [Applause] The Forgotten men and women of America will never ever be forgotten again you were forgotten the last administration was sleepy Joe and Obama tried to ran through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated worse than NAFTA worse than WTO it was called the trans-pacific partnership it would have been a disaster TPP would have gutted the American auto industry would have been in shambles our auto industry is coming back so strong would have gutted would have destroyed the industry but in my first week in office I proudly were through the United States from that job destroying catastrophe and we\\'re imposing beautiful well placed tariffs money comes in on foreign countries that cheat our workers steal our jobs and break all of the rules I\\'m sorry and by the way they\\'ve been changing and charging tariffs on us for years we have countries that you are just 100 percent two hundred percent two hundred and ninety seven percent in the case of Canada with your farm products we\\'re not going to stand for it and man did we turn things around and we\\'ve just started if companies don\\'t want to pay a tariff I have one simple solution come make your product in America come make your product in New Hampshire zero tariffs zero no Tara together we\\'re restoring this nation\\'s industrial mine and we are doing it with American iron American aluminum and American steel with doing steel steel industry is high steel and they were dumping steel all over they were destroying our companies you are steel now all of them they\\'re all expanding to steel industry is back it\\'s doing great we\\'re opening up mines in Minnesota the great state of Minnesota they are magnificent mines that have the best iron ore in the world and President Obama closed them down maybe we can get representative Omar from Minnesota to open up but I don\\'t think she\\'ll open them up I don\\'t think so representative Omar that\\'s another one we\\'re replacing NAFTA with the brand-new USMC a that\\'s Mexico and Canada great deal the u.s. MCA will create countless jobs for farmers manufacturers all across the state we need Congress to pass the u.s. MCA immediately we\\'ll make it a bipartisan deal we don\\'t even want credit the unions benefit the non unions benefit everybody benefits it brings it back to fairness and it makes it very hard for our companies to leave our countries go to Mexico or Canada we lose all our jobs we lose all our taxes we end up with empty factories and plants it makes it almost impossible we\\'re not going to have that that was my one rule that I had to have it\\'s gonna be very very hard for companies to do that I\\'ve also taken the toughest ever action to stand up to China\\'s chronic trade abuses earlier this month the US government officially labeled China for the first time ever a currency manipulator another promise kept while others allow China to freely loot the US economy 500 billion dollars a year not needed not million billion with a B we\\'ve made it clear that the theft of American jobs and American wealth is over yet today The Wall Street Journal editorial board and some others continued to puppers foolish articles that demonstrate that they understand nothing about trade or business nothing they advocate only economic surrender they actually say go to China take off the tariffs make a deal I lose all the guards we take off the towers we don\\'t have any cards think of it they say go to Europe by the way the European Union is worse than China just smaller it treats us horribly barriers tariffs taxes and we let them come in it\\'s worse than China many of us come from there I do that\\'s what it\\'s got going that\\'s about it they treat us really badly and many others many many others India tariffs US probably higher than any nation anywhere in the world we have Terrace of a hundred percent on products and much more than that India so what working on all of them I called Prime Minister Modi I said mr. Prime Minister not fair we got a change we\\'ve got a change kind of change and we\\'re talking to them very seriously we\\'ve talked into a lot of places but when the wall street journal\\' comes out and they say no no take the terrace off go talk to chuck they\\'ve been trying to talk to him for 25 years but actually you know what they really haven\\'t the fact is the leaders that were in my position they didn\\'t do a damn thing they didn\\'t talk past leaders followed the terrible advice of these editorial boards that are frankly totally inexperienced in business I guess and our industries were utterly decimated globalism enriches foreign countries at our expense globalism I love our country I\\'m the president of the United States of America I\\'m not the president of the world and as long as I\\'m president America will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many we as we restore our prosperity we are also restoring public safety we are fighting to reduce violent crime you see so much at over the last 25 years so much crime and ensure that every American can live in safety and peace and yet with all that you see we\\'ve had one of the best years of crime prevention that we\\'ve ever had wouldn\\'t seem that way but it is one of the best years because those gentlemen that we just saw law enforcement they do a great job and you\\'ve been reading about this a lot lately we are working very hard to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of insane people and those who are mentally sick and shouldn\\'t have guns but people have to remember however that there is a mental illness problem that has to be dealt with it\\'s not the gun that pulls the trigger it\\'s the person holding years ago many cities and states i remembered so well closed mental institutions for budgetary reasons they let those people out onto the street you probably have your examples up here I can tell you in New York they closed so many of them and they let really seriously mentally ill people out on the streets and you see plenty of them today even today we\\'re going to have to give major consideration to building new facilities for those in need we have to do it and at the same time we will be taking mentally deranged and dangerous people off of the streets so we won\\'t have to worry so much about that the big problem we don\\'t have those institutions anymore and people can\\'t get proper care they\\'re seriously ill people and they\\'re on the streets we can\\'t make it harder for good solid law-abiding citizens to protect themselves we will always uphold the right to self-defense and we will always uphold the Second Amendment we will so important one of the most powerful promises I made to the people of this state was to confront the opioid and drug epidemic I used to go around New Hampshire more than any state and you\\'d say sir the state is infested you said sir we\\'re like a drug den you tell me and I didn\\'t really see it and then I met with the police officers and fire departments and all the people that do and you you just seemed to have a bigger problem and by the way the wall is being built gonna stop a lot of them walls big it\\'s being built you know we have the fake news you know about that with a a wall that\\'s lying on the ground in a very important section so we pick up the wall it\\'s in pieces I mean literally it\\'s gone and we build a brand new 30-foot steel and concrete wall and the fake media said he didn\\'t know the wall that\\'s just renovation there was no what\\'s lying underground people walk right over and it\\'s rotted rusted gone we take it away we put a brand new wall up they give me no credit you know why because they\\'re fake news that\\'s why we\\'re building a lot of wall the Army Corps of Engineers is doing a great job they\\'re doing a great job since I took office we\\'ve attacked the challenge with everything we have we have secured a record six billion dollars in new funding opioid we vastly increased the distribution of overdose reversing drugs which are pretty amazing things we\\'ve given them to your Police Department your fire department it\\'s pretty amazing we have reduced the total amount of opioids prescribed by 34 percent and the Department of Justice has prosecuted more than three thousand defendant in opioids related cases and our public awareness campaign about the terrible suffering that drugs inflict has already reached fifty eight percent of all young Americans I said that you have to show them we\\'re doing ads beautiful ads shows them and you\\'ve seen them I don\\'t even want to describe them they\\'re brutal but we\\'re doing ads on television and papers about how bad it is for children so they can see it because the greatest thing we can do is not get people started on drugs right not get up stand it\\'s hard to get off you know we can get them off and we\\'re doing it and it\\'s been done but it\\'s hard to get off if they never start it\\'s real easy it\\'s real easy so we\\'re trying to get young kids you won\\'t see the fruits of this labor for a little while because it takes a while but we\\'re really we are working so hard on advertising and promotions to tell young kids children how bad drugs are how dangerous they are how horrible they are how they destroy your brain how they do so many bad things and they\\'re really very tough ads they\\'re hard-hitting ads and I think they\\'re having a big impact you\\'ll see over time you\\'ll see but we still have much work to do but as a result of these efforts last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in 31 years pretty amazing and at the center of America\\'s drug crisis is the border crisis vast quantities of deadly narcotics are being smuggled across the border including meth cocaine heroin and fentanyl and as part of my trade deal with China it\\'s been very important and President Xi said he\\'s going to do it so far he has not done it but I said you have to stop sending us fentanyl Shafto and you have to criminalize in China the making of fentanyl and so far he has not come through but I think he will you\\'ll know you\\'ll know yet Democrats want to open borders and Republicans want strong borders that\\'s your difference one wants open borders who can even think of an open door to think of it even though many people that come into our country a wonderful people they\\'re still coming in illegally they\\'re not coming in through merit but what about the bad ones we have serious serious criminals that want to come in and if we had open borders they would be flowing in like you\\'ve never seen before Democrats want open borders they don\\'t mind crime we do mind crime and that\\'s the way it is Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities last year alone sanctuary cities decline more than 17,000 requests from federal authorities to hand over criminal aliens already in their custody in other words 17,000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into u.s. communities you don\\'t understand even what the hell are they doing what are they doing 17,000 Republicans believe our city should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans not for criminal alien and we will always support the amazing heroes of ice and Border Patrol and we will always support law enforcement every Democrat candidate also wants to give illegal immigrants free welfare [Applause] Republicans believe public benefits should be protected for truly needy Americans not for illegal aliens and we should reduce our taxes and many other things with all of that money that we\\'re talking about we need to elect a strong Republican majority to end sanctuary cities stop human traffickers stop drug smugglers and adopt an immigration system that puts the needs of American workers and families first it\\'s also time for Democrats to join with us to protect the sacred integrity of our elections by supporting voter ID voter identification it\\'s incredible they constantly say oh we need to protect over they\\'re not looking for that they\\'re not looking for that we say what about voter ID in other words you have a picture you have to go up what about voter ID that they don\\'t want to do but we need voter ID [Applause] [Music] the Democrat Party has never been farther outside the mainstream [Applause] where do they come from you know you say you want low taxes good education strong military strong borders you want to have safe homes you want a house you want low interest rates you got low hey you got low interest rates the lowest ever got lower it\\'s good time to refinance your house by the way great time you got everything and then you see these people they\\'re against they have no idea what they\\'re doing they have no idea what they\\'re against every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of health care that would raid Medicare and destroy the private health insurance plans of millions of American families that they love my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you the individual mandate is gone the most unpopular part of Obamacare and we almost have Obamacare gone we\\'re closed we would have had it before but we had a vote that was a little bit surprising I\\'m sure none of you knew who that vote was we had it done repeal and replace but it\\'s going to happen and I think it\\'s gonna actually be in the end actually better you watch so we got rid of the individual mandate which was the most unpopular part of Obamacare and we\\'re running it better you know I had a political decision do I make it great Alexes or a secretary do we run it well and sort of say hey we run it well or do we run it badly and have everybody upset we said we got to run it well but it\\'s still much too expensive it\\'s lousy health care but we got rid of the worst part of it individual mandate individual mandate where you have the privilege of buying the right not to have to pay for expensive insurance that\\'s no good health insurance and we won\\'t and you got to remember this Republicans and I speak for every one of them we will always protect pre-existing conditions we\\'re going to protect Oh got to do it our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in 51 years and the only decline in 51 years we have launched a historic initiative to require price transparency empowering you to choose the lowest price for yourself and for your family believe it or not you didn\\'t have the right to go in and price your drugs who could even believe this I wonder if Big Pharma had something to do with that so we\\'re gonna have transparency virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up up til right up until the moment of birth [Applause] and in the case of the Virginia Governor he\\'s having a rough rough time in his case the baby is born and then he goes to talk to the mother the doctor talks to the mother the baby is now born wrapped as he said and then they decide whether or not to execute the baby that is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God hard to believe it Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and socialism [Applause] the Republican Party is the party of freedom we are the party of the American worker the American family and the American dream and I\\'m fighting for you each and every day so importantly we have confirmed more than 140 federal judges within 90 days it will be 179 federal judges thank you very much President Obama thank you very much I don\\'t know what happened to them but I came to office and I had a hundred and thirty-eight judges that were not appointed by President Obama so I say Thank You mr. president very good and they\\'ll say he was a great president oh the fake news he was a great president he was a great president how come he left me a hundred and thirty-eight judges to a point when everybody says that\\'s the single most important thing a president of the United States has to do great president he was great he was a great president and these judges will apply the laws written including we appointed two great Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and to help patients with life-threatening illnesses we also passed something I\\'m so proud of 44 years they couldn\\'t get it passed right to try you can use our newest our best medicines incredible what\\'s happening I\\'m so proud of that and this from forever five decades we passed for our great veterans VA choice and VA accountability and one of our great friends was a veteran who\\'s been with me in New Hampshire don\\'t know where you are where\\'s our guy where is he [Applause] so well so I walk in I said oh he\\'s been with me from the beginning he was aware that he liked Trump and I came in he said sir he\\'s a great veteran he said sir I have cancer and sir I went into the vet they were very very late they had problems I\\'m not blaming them but they gave me the right to go out and get a great cancer surgeon he had his operation you look much better than you did three years ago out much better much better be a choice right out Pho great story thank you very much and thank you for your loyalty you\\'ve been he was been to every rally I ever gave in New Hampshire right from the beginning I got so tired of looking at him he\\'d always be here now he\\'s look at him now he\\'s sitting in very good that\\'s good but I appreciate that story I appreciate a VA choice just makes sense right doesn\\'t it make sense we\\'ve achieved record funding for the United States military 716 two billion dollars 700 billion dollars and 738 billion dollars and it\\'s almost completely rebuilt including and we hope to god we never have to use it we have the finest most powerful nuclear capability anywhere on the face of the earth and I hope to god we never have to use it we\\'re investing in the future of human spaceflight and someday soon American astronauts will plant two stars and stripes on the surface of Mars and I told my guys at NASA you know NASA when we took it over it was exhausted the runways and the ground said all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete you wouldn\\'t recognize it now it\\'s beautiful it\\'s the best place anywhere on earth and I also said though you know I hear all these rich guys for some reason they love space so they\\'re rich I said let them send the Rockets up what the hell do we have to do it right so I see Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk they\\'re putting Rockets up I think it\\'s great and they pay us rent they use our facility that\\'s good but we\\'re also doing it at NASA has some of the greatest plans we\\'ve ever had these are great people great scientists but we also let the private sector put up rockets the one which recently went up and you see the engines coming back down and they\\'re coming there\\'s no wings no nothing it\\'s almost like what are we watching is this fiction and they come down and they save all of the propellants all of the the really the most expensive parts they\\'re able to save it by bringing it back right to where it took off who would think they could do this I never saw this before six months ago but they\\'re doing it now more and more they\\'re saving a lot of the most important and expensive parts of rockets so we have a lot of rich guys paying us a lot of rent but we\\'re also doing it ourselves to protect America\\'s security I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and just three months ago we also recognized the Golan Heights as being a part of and protected by Israel for years you watch as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Hampshire thank you and you must never forget the 2020 election right around the corner 2020 right around the corner and it\\'s about one thing you know what the one thing is you it\\'s about you it\\'s about your family it\\'s about your future and it\\'s about the fate of your country so when we ran together last time we said the most importantly we had to turn it around this country was going bad you see what happened to Venezuela with socialism Venezuela 15 years ago was one of the richest countries now they don\\'t have water they don\\'t have food they don\\'t have anything and this was one of the richest nations in the world they don\\'t have anything we\\'re working on it we\\'re helping people but it\\'s very sad it\\'s never going to happen to us because we will never ever be a socialist nation no matter what label they use a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and destruction the destruction of the American Dream we have a dream it\\'s a great dream this is the destruction of the American Dream we begin this campaign tonight with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of New Hampshire and for the people of America together we will lift millions more citizens

system of immigration we will enact trade deals that are already happening that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine ending the AIDS epidemic in America and finding new cures for childhood cancer and something I never thought I\\'d be able to say within one decade the AIDS epidemic in the United States will be gone think of that did you ever think you were gonna hear that now did you ever think you were gonna hear that the work they\\'ve done on AIDS is incredible it\\'s an incredible thing when they told me that it\\'s just shattering it just it breaks your heart what\\'s happened but think of it in 10 years the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated so great who thought that was going to be happening who thought I\\'d be able to get to say that so early in what we\\'re doing together we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America we will support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we will stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true American Way we believe that

where this every American heart then it\\'s time we stand and say [Music] where it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] no doubt [Music] [Applause] [Music] Wow thank you thank you everybody thank you and vice president Mike Pence thank you very much incredible and hello to Fayetteville it\\'s great to be here in North Carolina\\'s ninth congressional district with the hard-working Patriots who believe in faith family God and country thank you thank you tomorrow you\\'ll head to the polls to elect a congressman who always puts America first Dan Bishop I\\'ve just come from a meeting with North Carolina officials representing communities hit by Hurricane Dorian and I express the unwavering solidarity of the American people we are behind you 100% the prayers of our entire nation are with the citizens of North Carolina South Carolina Georgia Florida and everyone else that was in the storm\\'s path and I will say I was called by the government of the Bahamas and we\\'re helping with the bomb as they were hit so hard they were hit so hard who would believe it we pledged to full support of the federal government through every step of the rebuilding process and I will say North Carolina in our country probably got hit the hardest that was a little bit of a surprise but I know one thing about North Carolina you can take it and you\\'ll build it quickly and you\\'ll build it beautiful and you\\'ll be back sooner than anybody ever thought and it\\'ll be better than ever right no doubt about they also want to give a special recognition to the many non-governmental organizations doing so much to help people recover from durian in particular Franklin Graham he\\'s a wonderful guy and he\\'s got an organization Samaritan\\'s Purse based right here in North Carolina and the work that Franklin is his family and all of those that are with Franklin Graham we want to thank them this special great people great people Thank You Franklin thank you credible job he does such a great job all over wherever there\\'s a problem you see Samaritan\\'s Purse and franklin and his people we love the people of this state and we will never ever leave your side North Carolina will truly recover so fast I know you people so well let\\'s not even talk about it let\\'s not even talk about it we\\'re here tonight to discuss the extraordinary progress we\\'re making as a nation and how to ensure this amazing resurgence keeps on going and going strong in just over two years we\\'ve taken this big beautiful ship and it\\'s being turned around very quickly nobody thought this would happen you know we won the greatest election certainly one of them but maybe the greatest but we won one of the greatest let\\'s say won this way I won\\'t be criticized they\\'ll say you know George Washington had a great election - the fake news right a fake [Applause] but we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that and you would be in big trouble if we didn\\'t I can tell you that you\\'d be instead of going up we were heading in the wrong direction we have the number one economy anywhere in the world and every time I meet a foreign leader almost every time they say congratulations on what you\\'ve done with the economy I said I didn\\'t do it I just set a certain path the people of the United States did it number one anywhere in the world and they tried to do the recession thing you know they tried the Russia thing that didn\\'t work they tried many other things I always say the media and their partner the Democrats [Applause] I wouldn\\'t mind fighting the Democrats but we really have to look at it so to some it\\'s the media and the Democrats it\\'s one and the same we\\'re rebuilding our military defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation America is winning again and America is respected again they respect America by the way I have about like 10th women in the front row and you come from North Carolina and they travel all over the place hold up your hands these are great women I see them so much and I must say they have other things to do they look rich as hell to me I don\\'t know how many is this how many rallies have you come to they can\\'t count they said all of them except for two that\\'s a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area that\\'s so great well at least you won\\'t have to travel so far for this one right thank you very much for being here we really appreciate it well we appreciate it we appreciate it thank you really incredible people but you know we\\'ve created six million new jobs since election day and I couldn\\'t say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it six million new jobs more Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country almost 160 million Americans nobody would have thought that was possible we wouldn\\'t have been able to say it actually we\\'ve now had 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3% so that people that work so hard you remember I used to say during the rallies before we won people worked two jobs three jobs and they made less money than they made 21 years before and now wages are going up the economy is doing great and jobs have never been better so importantly more than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps nearly 600,000 Americans entered the labor force last month alone think about it and the unemployment rate for African Americans just reached another brand do yesterday all-time low in the history of our country how do you lose that debate remember I used to say what do you have to lose well now you have the best unemployment numbers employment and unemployment numbers that you\\'ve ever had as african-americans as asian-americans as Hispanic Americans the best numbers we\\'ve ever had and by the way African American youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history [Applause] and the labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years and soon will be 35 years and soon I promise we\\'ll probably end up being better than ever I can tell you the unemployment numbers for women are the best they\\'ve been now in 72 years so I always say kiddingly I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t make it historic but you know what it\\'s gonna be historic very soon that\\'ll be historic cars and here in North Carolina over 230,000 more people now have jobs and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25 percent but the Radical Democrats want to dismantle demolish and destroy everything that you\\'ve gained and they will do it and it won\\'t take that long and that\\'s why we need Dan bishop and Greg Murphy we need them we need them going down to Congress and helping but they can do it it\\'s also why we need four more years it has to see this like a plant we\\'ve changed things right Keep America great we\\'ve changed things but it\\'s got to grow it\\'s got to develop those roots and once it does it\\'s going to be very hard for them to destroy what we\\'ve done very hard and that\\'s really why I consider this election look we had a very very special day in 2016 it was a very special time it\\'s an incredible day an incredible month an incredible year and I don\\'t know that you can ever compare anything to it but I can say this 2020 is essentially just as important because they\\'ll try and take it away whether it has to do with religion our evangelicals are here tonight and they\\'re all over [Applause] and what we\\'ve done for them and for religion is so important you know the other side I don\\'t think they\\'re big believers and not big believers in religion that I can tell you you listen to some of them they\\'re trying they\\'re trying to put out little statements they\\'re not working too well those statements are a little bit sort of not too good huh what is the word we want to use here little now now they\\'re pushing a little hard and it\\'s not play it\\'s not working to stop the far-left you must vote in tomorrow\\'s special election so important or get your votes in early I think a lot of who voted early for Dan Bishop good well that\\'s good but the big thing is tomorrow tomorrow\\'s the election and you\\'ll get out to protect your family you must defeat open borders and you have a Democrat named Dan McReady and he wants open borders he wants sanctuary said he\\'s not going to protect your Second Amendment he\\'s doing nothing on you SEC you know North Carolina is a very big Second Amendment site and Dan bishop Gregg Murphy these guys they\\'re going to protect your Second Amendment but one of the biggest issues in this election is in fact sanctuary cities MacCready support sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods get out go ahead go into the neighborhood going to what\\'s your neighborhood where do you live Rutherford County ok so how do you feel about having them release hardened horrible criminals into Rutherford County I don\\'t think so [Applause] but your whole state it\\'s honestly can I be honest it\\'s crazy what\\'s happening this whole thing with sanctuary cities and you go to California which is so many sanctuary cities they don\\'t know what\\'s happening out there you have people that want to get rid of those sanctuary cities they just aren\\'t able to do it with the people that get elected a lot of illegal voting going on out there by the way a lot of illegal voting in August McCready said it was quote the right call to set illegal alien criminals loose in the great state I\\'m using the words great state he doesn\\'t of North Carolina with the support and encouragement of McCready sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina have released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities and you see it you see the charges against these three criminals include sexual assault robbery drug crimes kidnapping and homicide murder why would you do it why would you do it what is it explain it just recently Mecklenburg County set free an illegal alien charged with first-degree rape and crimes against the child support for sanctuary cities is disloyalty to American citizens and McCready wants sanctuary cities with all of their protections for people that are serious criminals tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the America hating left and that\\'s got to be and by the way we\\'re building that wall and it\\'s going up very big and you think it\\'s easy to get money when you have the entire Democrat Party and they control the house that we want to change that we want to flip the house we\\'ll get so much it\\'ll be amazing what we can do for our country we don\\'t want dangerous criminal aliens roaming free in North Carolina we want to take care of it this state should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not for criminal Ellie our great Republican candidate Dan Bishop will fight with everything he has to stop sanctuary cities and defend the people of this great state dan come on up Dan bishop everyone get out and vote come on up there hello North Carolina hello Fayetteville hello 9th district of North Carolina mr. president we\\'re not tired of winning we want to keep on winning and tomorrow Tuesday September 10 2019

interest you know that better than anybody and this state knows it better than anybody they traded away your factory sold your future squandered your tax dollars sacrifice your security and bogged us down in one foreign debacle after another but all of that is changed we\\'re respected again they\\'re all saying oh gee I hope he doesn\\'t do this or that they\\'ve taken advantage of us for years and I have to say sadly in many cases it\\'s our allies that took the greatest advantage of this country but now you finally have a president who understands that I\\'m not supposed to be the president of the world I\\'m supposed to be the President of the United States to bring back our jobs from other countries we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history we\\'ve cut a record number of job-killing regulations no president no matter how long they serve has gotten anywhere even close to what we\\'ve done with regulations and that\\'s one of the reasons their economy is so good and we have tremendous potential upward and China wants to talk they want to talk China\\'s lost three million jobs thousands of companies are leaving China the supply chain is crumbling because they can\\'t pay the tariffs and our country has taken over things that you would have never thought as an example hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs and China is eating the cost which the fake news doesn\\'t want to tell you and out of the tens of billions of dollars that we\\'ve taken in because of the fact that our great American patriot farmers have been targeted by China they\\'ve been targeted because they know farmers Trump I love farmers and I said to sonny perdue Secretary of Agriculture Sonny how much was it last year and the year before tell me it was twelve billion dollars and were 16 billion dollars and out of the tariffs that we\\'ve taken in we gave to our farmers for distribution hopefully very good distribution hopefully very even distribution we\\'ve given them twenty eight billion dollars so that their home so that their home nobody would ever do that nobody would ever do that I can tell you that right now and our farmers know we have to fight I see it all the time where some of the networks that are crazy they have a group of farmers in some cases they have groups of women they say what do you think of President Trump we like them a lot well with them all the way and they want to turn off the cameras they go crazy but with the farmers you know that you ever see that the ten women what do you think of President Trump we love them what would I like to put you on television I\\'ll tell you right back and they can\\'t turn off those cameras fast enough but they say to the farmers you voted for President Trump are you happy and every one of them said he did things that nobody has ever done before who would think of getting 12 billion plus 16 billion twenty eight billion dollars because they\\'ve been targeted that\\'s the amount I asked Sonny I said Sonny what\\'s the amount they took out of our farmers and was 16 billion in the year before twelve and I said Sonny we got to make that up and we made it up who would do that nobody would do that first of all nobody else ever had tens of billions of dollars pouring in from China because it\\'s always been the other way around China has taken advantage of our country for decades decades and I guarantee you one thing none of these Democrats whether it\\'s Pocahontas or sleepy Joe none of them would be able to do a thing about it and nobody would ever think of helping the farmers who have been targeted by China China made five hundred billion dollars over the last number of years on a yearly basis they steal our intellectual property so many other things so now it\\'s just different and now it\\'s working the other way and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them they\\'re a beautiful thing and I want China to do well and I hope they do well but they\\'ve had now the worst year in 57 years I wonder why I wonder why and hopefully it all work out we\\'ll see we\\'re going to be talking next week we\\'re talking now are they going to be coming to the United States in two or three weeks and we\\'ll see what happens but unless we\\'re going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country let\\'s face it we cannot go back to a situation we\\'re giving hundreds of billions of dollars to China becomes standard fair not going to happen we can\\'t do it and we have many other countries also but we\\'ll worry about them a little bit later plenty of others plenty of others they\\'ve taken advantage of our country like you wouldn\\'t believe and I\\'ve been saying this for many years I was saying this when I was a private citizen they take our jobs they make our product they sell the product into our country with no tax no nothing so we end up with closed factories no jobs no taxes no nothing and these other countries gain as an example Mexico I must say they\\'ve really helped us at the border the Democrats will not do anything about these horrible open loopholes which would be so good so we\\'re doing it a different way and Mexico is now patrolling with twenty seven thousand troops they\\'d never had two troops to it our border and you saw the numbers today we\\'re down approximately 57% but our country could fix it so easy if the Democrats would sit with me for 15 minutes but they don\\'t want to do that because they want to have open borders they want to have drugs pouring into our country you have to have a wall and you have to stop it and when you look at what\\'s happening with human trafficking and it\\'s mostly women they traffic in women and they pour through our borders well every inch of wall that we put up is vital and were putting up miles and miles and we intend by next year at the end of the year to have anywhere between 400 and 500 miles of wall built and this is serious wall this is the real deal serious law and I want to thank our new Secretary of Defense Marv Kasper for the job he\\'s done and he views it really as a national security threat and you have to what can be much more threatening than people that want to pour across our borders and we have the worst laws we have the weakest laws in the history of any country you can\\'t do anything to stop them you have a program catch and release you catch them and then you have to release them and they\\'re supposed to come back to court in the next three four five six years and nobody shows up and the Democrats don\\'t want to fix it so we\\'re stopping them so we don\\'t even have to worry about court we ended the last administration\\'s cruel war on American energy the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the and for all of these crazy people but they\\'re not so crazy they know what they\\'re doing they talk about Russia Russia Russia Russia\\'s not too happy about that their primary source of income is oil and gas and now we\\'re bigger than Russia bigger than Saudi Arabia we\\'re bigger than everybody and we\\'re doing great so they\\'re not exactly happy the Russian hoax was a pure hoax you saw that with call me the other day yet every leading Democrat running for president pledges to ban the energy that drives our economy and wage and under if you look at what\\'s going on your way of life is under assault by these people I mean I go out and sometimes I get these huge audiences and I wish we could have gotten a larger arena than this we tried I was even willing to stand out in the rain and get my hair soaking wet but they said it was a little bit out of your district and I said I don\\'t know if it looks good being out of your district but I was willing to do and I would have taken it I would have been very proud to have done it it would have shown it\\'s my real hair at least it wouldn\\'t be pretty where\\'s my hair may not be great but I will say it\\'s better than most of my friends who are the same age a lot better a lot but I do you know we had a different location as you all know and we said let\\'s do this one it\\'s bigger and we put screens outside for all of the people we have screens and loudspeakers and everything it\\'s really amazing what\\'s going on out there but after years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country that\\'s the bottom line and the last administration with Biden and Obama at the helm they tried to ram through one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated the trans-pacific partnership you could have kissed many of your industries goodbye TPP would have gutted the American auto industry it would have been even worse than NAFTA and we know how bad NAFTA was all you have to do is even to this day look around at all those empty plants where people move down and companies move down to Mexico not under the USMC a we got to get Nancy Pelosi to put it up for a vote make it bipartisan she\\'ll have tremendous Democrat support the farmers wanted the union\\'s wanted the manufacturers want it and by the way 600,000 manufacturing jobs in this country remember you would need a magic wand you can\\'t do that anymore well we did it but we\\'ve got to get us MCA put up for a vote by the Democrats but in my first week in office I proudly withdrew from that job destroying TPP catastrophe and we\\'re replacing one of the worst trade deals ever made by any country you can go back as far as you want NAFTA the disaster of NAFTA so whatever you do start talking to you people we need a vote or the US MCA that\\'s United States Mexico and Canada and they\\'ve already voted they want it and we want it and it\\'s great for the farmers it\\'s great for everybody we\\'re also aggressively combating a problem that you have in North Carolina problem that we have in almost all states the opioid epidemic last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years and at the center of the American drug crisis is the border crisis criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across our southern border including heroin meth cocaine and fentanyl a hundred thousand people a year die from what comes across our southern border and we can\\'t get the Democrats to help us in sealing it even tighter we gotta get them we gotta get them we gotta get them so if you want to stop with the drug smugglers the human traffickers the vicious ms-13 gang members have by the way thank you to ice these people go into those they go into those nests we call them nests these are vicious vicious people we go into the nest with our ice people and you know for them it\\'s another day at the office there aren\\'t too many people in this room that want to do it for a living let me see that guy could maybe him maybe her right maybe her but it\\'s a rough job and they get so little praise for the job they do so dangerous these are these are many killers in those gangs and we\\'re taking them out of our country by the thousands m-master and as you know Democrats even want to give free health care to illegal immigrants as long as I\\'m your president I will never ever let Democrats take away your healthcare and give it away free to people that have entered our country illegally we can\\'t do that it\\'s a tremendous incentive to come in Democrats also want to bring in unlimited numbers of foreign refugees from overseas all at the expense of supporting their own communities Republicans no matter what you do where you are we want people to obey our laws we want people that are going to help our country the Democrat Party has never been farther outside of the mainstream every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of health care that would raid Medicare force private doctors out of medicine and lead to the rationing of life-saving treatments and you know they\\'re going to take away your private health care your private insurance 180 million people will lose with what they want to do it\\'s a disaster you know it\\'s like did you ever really sort of feel where you don\\'t even have to treat people nicely you don\\'t have any choice you have to vote for me I can leave right now I can say North Carolina I\\'ve had it with you I\\'m leaving right now and you know what you got to go out and vote what are you gonna do put one of these crazy people running our country again but it\\'s never been so far left I told the story the other day about a businessman I saw one of the biggest in the country you probably know his name one of the biggest he\\'s hated me for 20 years that I\\'ve hated him also okay now they\\'re gonna go out tomorrow breaking news Donald Trump hates people and you were sort of right about that I never liked this guy and I see him in the White House and I say what are you doing here and he\\'s just mr. president see now he calls me mr. president he used to call me something else mr. president I\\'m fighting for your victory I said you gotta be kidding he goes honestly you\\'re doing a great job but also if this radical left gets in they\\'re gonna take away everything and they\\'re gonna destroy our country and for the first time I like this guy my administration is defending your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you remember President Obama 28 times remember 28 times they counted them and there\\'s much more than that I would imagine that you can choose your plan you can choose your doctor it didn\\'t work out that way did it Obamacare and we\\'re keeping Obamacare alive we got rid of the individual mandate the worst part of Obamacare we\\'re keeping it and running it as well as it can but the premiums are too high the deductibles are through the roof it\\'s ridiculous and we\\'re coming up with Lindsey Graham and all of the folks were coming up with a great health care plan that if we take back the house that\\'s why Dan and Greg if we take back the house if we keep the Senate maybe even increase it a little bit wouldn\\'t be bad and on the assumption we keep the presidency you\\'re gonna have great health [Applause] thank you we almost had it we had a man campaigning for eight years to knock out Obamacare when he voted it didn\\'t work out that way did it we had it we would have had it but we\\'re gonna end up actually with a better plan sometimes through adversity things work out better we\\'re gonna end up with a better plan you watch will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions also always you have my word our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up to the moment of birth and if you look at Virginia the governor of Virginia he was even talking about essentially you would say an execution he was talking after the baby is born the doctor will talk to the mother and they\\'ll make a decision as to whether or not that baby lives this is a radical Democrat idea and that\\'s why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God [Applause] Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and socialism they\\'re socialists the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and the American Dream everyday we\\'re making good on the motto promises made promises kept in fact we are keeping even more promises by far than we made or then we promise so many more so many more so many more you know what we did with respect to people that are very sick or terminally ill right right to try school I love the name right to try we have some of the greatest doctors in the world labs in the world hospitals in the world and we have incredible medicine that\\'s prohibited from being used until it gets approval and sometimes that approval can take many years and I said wait a minute if a person is sick and they\\'ve been trying to get this for 45 years instead of a person sick and maybe terminally ill why aren\\'t we letting them try this new technology and so many things are happening and we did right to try and it wasn\\'t easy but I was helped by Lindsay and a lot of great people a lot of great people all of them helped mark help so much all of them helped Greg we have had tremendous success we had so many people wanting to help but it was complicated believe it or not because the country didn\\'t want the liability I said you know what you do you draw up an agreement taking away the liability he said that\\'s a good idea the insurance companies and the drug companies were very unsure there\\'s been going on for many years I got it done the results have been unbelievable right to try things that we never even talked about we\\'re getting done and you know maybe one of the biggest things is within about a month we\\'ll have close to 180 federal judges including Appellate Division judges including two great new Supreme Court justices justice Neil corsets and justice Brett Kavanaugh who they put through hell we passed something that they\\'ve wanted to do for half a century we passed V a choice so when you\\'re great when you\\'re great and honored veterans are waiting in line for three weeks four weeks five days ten days two months they go to a private doctor we pay for the bill and they get themselves taken care of instead of dying which was happened and we also passed VA accountability on behalf of our great veterans that means when they treat our veterans badly and they wouldn\\'t have done it in prime time I can tell you but when they treat our sick and troubled veterans badly we can say you have fired get there it\\'s called va accountability that\\'s another one they\\'ve been trying and in all fairness the unions made it very tough civil service made it like almost impossible everyone said you\\'ll never get it done we got it done I want to thank the Republican Senate I want to thank some incredible people in the House of Representatives and Kevin I want to thank you because that was a great job you did on that one that was a great job thank you Kevin McCarthy we\\'ve achieved record funding for the US military 700 billion dollars last year 716 billion dollars this year 738 billion dollars and you know I\\'m a big believer in budgets but we had no choice we had to rebuild our military with all that\\'s going on today with China with Russia with radical Islam with everything that\\'s happening we had to do something and you know budgets are fine I love budgets and we\\'ll get to that don\\'t worry about it but we had a rebuild our military was totally depleted it was totally depleted and now we have beautiful new f-35s f-18s new ships new missiles new rockets we have new everything I came back with Admiral Brown the United States Coast Guard and some of the other folks and they were saying that the new Coast Guard cutters how good a job has the Coast Guard done during these hurricanes and I said Admiral how good are the new Coast Guard cutters he said to the finest in the world sir we have to find and they had old broken equipment that they had to keep going on her shoestring they have brand new Coast Guard cutters we had to do it we had to do it there\\'s always time for the other but we had to do it we\\'ve rebuilt our military we\\'ve taken care of the great people that work in our military we gave them a raise a beautiful raise they were so entitled to it and I also got other NATO members to pay an additional 100 billion dollars over the last year and a half that they weren\\'t paying they were delinquent we\\'re supposed to protect them and they don\\'t pay I\\'d say you can\\'t do that you can\\'t do that you got to pay nato now we\\'re finally making immensely wealthy countries pay the cost of their defense we\\'re negotiating with a lot of them think of it we have these immensely wealthy countries and they\\'re paying for a fraction of our costs to defend them how did that happen and you know what the biggest excuse is when I got home and I\\'ll say King you gotta pay or mr. prime minister you gotta pay or mr. president you gotta pay you know it\\'s costing us billions of dollars to protect these wealth you know what their biggest thing is cuz I can\\'t understand how we did this for so many years decades decades you have been defending all of some I won\\'t mention names because I don\\'t want to embarrass anybody I don\\'t forget it some of the wealthiest countries and they were and when I say king president Prime Minister Queen no matter what I say you know what they say but nobody\\'s ever asked us to do that before that\\'s the only excuse because I say to them why would we do this why are we defending you you\\'re immensely wealthy you compete with us on trade we have lousy trade deals that we\\'re renegotiating many of them and ultimately all of them why are we protecting you mr. president well well I don\\'t know I don\\'t know but you know what their answer is because you\\'ve always done it that\\'s not a great answer so we\\'re taking in billions and billions but I got a hundred billion dollars and the Secretary General of NATO Sultan Berg is my biggest fan he said until President Trump you had to see that day no cost of spending was going like this and ours was going like this we were defending many countries that treat us very badly on traded very unfairly we were defending them and now it\\'s changing around 100 billion dollars they\\'re not happy and then I read where Obama is more popular in Germany than Trump he\\'s got to be I\\'m making people pay their bills he\\'s got to be you know the day that I\\'m more popular than him I\\'m not doing my job the big star they like him more in Europe than they like Trump I think they should hundred billion dollars more they\\'re paying to protect America\\'s security I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal we paid them a hundred and fifty billion dollars for that piece of work I withdrew it and we put sanctions all over the place and they\\'re a much different country and let\\'s see what happens but I can tell you that like to get back to business because they\\'re not doing very well when I came into office Iran was a real terror 18 sites of confliction they were behind every one of them in the Middle East and who knows could have been elsewhere and I said we\\'re not going to do it a hundred and fifty billion dollars president Obama paid and 1.8 billion in cash who ever saw a million dollars piled up as a promotion in hundred-dollar bills it\\'s a lot it\\'s a big now take a million dollars and make it 1.8 billion dollars in cash I\\'m actually more impressed with that number than 150 billion dollars you want to know the truth 1.8 billion dollars in cash and we got taken to the cleaners so I terminated the deal and I recognize Israel\\'s true Capitol and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem which every president said the and I also approved for Israel the Golan Heights and if you really think about it I said to people what\\'s more important the Golan Heights or the capital of Jerusalem by moving our embassy there he said neither sir what you\\'ve done in Iran is more important than both of my said you know I guess you\\'re right when you think about it so we\\'ve done a good job all of us together as a movement we\\'ve done a great job for Israel for years you watch as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of North Carolina [Music] you must never forget that the 2020 election is about one thing Younes true not about me it\\'s about you it\\'s about your family your future and the fate of your country that\\'s what we did in 2016 they came from the hills and the valleys they came from the cities they came from all over the place and people were saying these fakers back there they were saying what the hell is happening but I knew it was going to happen because we\\'d go out and would see these rallies the likes of which nobody has ever seen before ever ever ever in politics ever in politics a vote for any Democrat in 2020 and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream we are entering this campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for the people of North Carolina and I\\'ve said it and I say it loudly and proudly I don\\'t believe there\\'s been any president or any administration that has done more in two-and-a-half years then we have as a group then we have I don\\'t when you add it all up nobody\\'s done what we have our first task is a giant victory tomorrow right here in the great state of North Carolina with your support tomorrow we take the first steps to firing speaker Pelosi and winning back the house in 2012 we need everybody to get your friends get your family get your neighbors and get out and vote for Dan Bishop and get out and vote for Greg Murphy you got to get out tomorrow and vote together we will lift millions more from our horrible horrible situations that have developed over the years look at what\\'s happening to Democrat run cities every single one of them we\\'re going to lift millions more of our citizens from welfare-to-work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity with your help we will elect more republicans to Congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the USA boom made in the USA if you want made in America I don\\'t care what do you like better made in America or made in the USA go ahead wait ready will go made in America then made in the USA what do you like better made in America made in the USA okay so I think we know that answer so in 2016 we had in my opinion the greatest phrase in the history of politics make America great again right now we\\'re within moments hopefully of having despite what you heard a few weeks ago maybe were heading or they go like please please let that be recession please they\\'re willing to give up their results because they think it\\'ll help them win the election they\\'re not gonna win the election don\\'t forget we\\'re doing this and still fighting the unfairness of China and other countries or trade what happens when that gets fixed and other things get fixed well we\\'re setting new records and we\\'re fighting trade deals that were fighting military deals that are unfair to our country think what happens when it all gets fixed we have ourselves a country that\\'s going to be so strong but we had a phrase make right make America great again the best I think it was maybe the greatest 2016 but we\\'ve done a lot and now they\\'re very close to setting a new I think it\\'s the 100 an 18th time that we will have set a new record with the stock market right many many times many many times I can\\'t be sure that media but it\\'s a lot ok I always have to preface it because he\\'ll do headlines headlines jump didn\\'t tell the truth or they love it so I always I\\'ve gotten extremely cautious so we have the greatest phrase of all time I think even the fake news media would agree make America great again mega mega country make America great again ok now now we\\'ve largely we still have a year and a half a little bit less can you believe it like can you believe it I stood in the White House with the first lady that first night and I said wow look at this that\\'s the bedroom of Abraham Lincoln you have to see this it\\'s so perfectly done and so the way it was that\\'s the bedroom of the great Abe Lincoln I mean honey can you believe this that was the first night and now in less than a year and a half the first term will be over they that I announced today that we got the soccer world cup that\\'s a big thing who else is going to do it but it\\'s we\\'ve got a problem it\\'s in 2026 Jionni Infante who was a great guy and we announced it in front of the press and 2026 and I said well wait a minute under the normal rules I\\'ll be out in 2024 so we may have to go for an extra term oh they\\'re going crazy they\\'re going crazy tomorrow you\\'re gonna see headlines jump once an extra term I told you I told you he wants it he wants an extra term ladies and gentlemen we told you we told you he\\'s a dictator we told you no now I\\'m only kidding I\\'m okay but we actually have the World Cup it\\'s the biggest sporting event in the world then we got it and that\\'s great we\\'re working it also with Mexico Canada giving them some of the games we\\'re going to have a great relationship with the World Cup it\\'s a big deal really great Bob Kraft helped me New England Patriots people great Tom Brady had a pretty good game the other night right [Applause] and how good a coach whether you like it or not I know you\\'d North Carolina but how good a coach in all fairness right is coach Belichick okay how good is he all right how good is I know you want to be cool but it\\'s pretty good right we have to appreciate genius we all like genius but we\\'re going to achieve new breakthroughs in science medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending within ten years the AIDS epidemic in America that\\'s shocking to hear that but we could do that we\\'re going to do that definitely credible the strides that we\\'ve made we will defeat the Democrat effort to drive up the cost of houses cars health care and education by liberating Americans from their endless push for job-killing soul-crushing Washington regulations as an example we\\'re trying to get the car companies gonna give them a little bit of extra energy and they\\'ll be able to build a car that consumers can buy which will be better than the car they make today and you\\'ll save three thousand five hundred dollars think of that it\\'ll be safer it\\'ll be better you get to save three thousand five hundred dollars it\\'ll be less costly and we\\'re gonna try and get that done and then they were forcing you to buy light bulbs of course the fortune so I signed something a couple of days ago that gives you the right to continue to use the incandescent light I don\\'t know about you much less exposure I don\\'t know about you but I don\\'t know I\\'m not a vain person I know I have no vain people especially these incredible ladies in the front but I look better under an incandescent light than these crazy lights that are beaming down but you know somebody told me that as you know they\\'re much more expensive bulbs and for what you say but they said that if a bulb breaks it\\'s considered almost like a waste site it\\'s a very big thing bulbs the new bulbs they\\'re very dangerous with all of the gases at all and I said well what\\'s the point what are you saying well we\\'re saying if we continue that production they can buy whatever they want to buy but you\\'re going to save a tremendous amount of money and you\\'re going to have a life that\\'s better and there is a big danger in fact they have labels don\\'t break this bulb what are you gonna do you\\'re gonna throw it away I promise I won\\'t break it on the new one so you\\'re gonna hopefully buy the new ones but you can buy the old ones too and you can save a lot of money and you can even look better we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America will be one united nation we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of the law enforcement Thank You Laura we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true American Way like you we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag

Americans and the future belongs to us the future belongs to you with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting I\\'d like to find a little bit less but these people they just don\\'t stop they just keep coming at you in waves they are unfortunately not the best people and we are going to keep on winning winning winning we\\'re

and thousands of people outside who can\\'t get in we love we appreciate it we try to get the biggest arena we can get and they\\'re never big enough frankly so is something going on and I always say 2016 I don\\'t know if they\\'ll ever be another 2016 but right now it\\'s like a great tree or a great plant you plant it and it has to take whole we have to win 2020 and everyday and you know as well as I do we\\'re battling against the corrupt establishment of the past and we\\'re achieving historic victories for the American people we\\'re winning again we\\'re winning again and we\\'re winning big morning big crucially for your state we have ended the last administration\\'s war on American energy and since my election natural gas productions big story today in New Mexico has increased by 40% for our and that means great wages and it means jobs and that\\'s why you\\'re breaking every single record in your state\\'s book Trudeau oil production in New Mexico has more than doubled and going up a lot higher very quickly on your state\\'s energy revenues are up by nearly two-thirds think of that two-thirds and that\\'s it a short period of time give me a little bit more time okay the united states is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world this means more jobs higher wages and American energy independence which is what we have you know a few years ago if we had a problem like you saw two days ago in the Middle East we would have been in a panic although not if I were your president we never panicked we don\\'t want to panic but a few years ago they would have been in a panic today we got a lot of oil we got a lot of gas we don\\'t have to send too many boats over there do you notice the other day they were saying we don\\'t see too many American ships anymore you know why because we don\\'t need we\\'re independent as independent as anyone and we are now and that exporter of energy revenues from energy production provide up to 25 percent of your state\\'s budget and going much higher in the very near future and they\\'ve generated nearly a billion dollar budget surplus in New Mexico thank you very much president Trump thank you now under the green New Deal that all goes away that all goes away it all goes away you can forget it no more cows no more airplanes no more trips a single car make it electric single car you\\'re not allowed to travel more than 162 miles they\\'ll call us the Hermit nation will never leave our house now it\\'s crazy but that\\'s okay I don\\'t want to bring it up because I don\\'t want to do it too early maybe they\\'ll change I don\\'t want him to change but think of it for you and for Texas and for so many other places they want to get rid of your energy I mean explain that one explain that yet every major Democrat running for president they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas in other words the Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico\\'s economy the Democrats want us to be subservient to foreign producers they want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes it\\'s not happening anymore it\\'s been a long time it\\'s been a long time it\\'s not happening anymore but Democrats will never get the chance because New Mexico will never give them that chance [Applause] under this administration America is working again America is winning again and America is respected again like it hasn\\'t been a long time and I can tell you because I meet so many of the leaders and their presidents and their kings and the queens and their prime ministers and their everything dictators every once in a while every once in a while you get a rogue dictator and I\\'ll tell you they always start off today I had the crown prince of Bahrain and they come in and they say sir I\\'d like to congratulate you on what you\\'ve done with the economy of the United States it\\'s a model for the entire world they all say it and earlier today do we have any baseball fans right right you know what I\\'m producing but earlier today in the White House I had the honor of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom that\\'s the highest civilian award to someone who truly embodies the American dream baseball legend the greatest by the way the greatest relief pitcher of all time you look at those records Mariano Rivera it was something Yankees won a lotta World Series because of Mariano a great guy we gave him the medal doesn\\'t so much for charity the fantastic man fantastic family was a beautiful day at the White House L was good my administration is fighting to empower all Americans to reach their dreams and achieve their potential we have created six million new jobs since election day the fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign even as a projection unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years more than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps nearly 600,000 Americans came into the labor force last month alone think of that wages in your state New Mexico are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year which is unheard of twenty years ago and I used to say during the campaign you go back try to believe I\\'m here almost three years can you believe how time is flying can you believe I don\\'t know about it me but you look all much better than you did three years ago you\\'re wealthier and even with the me2 movement we can\\'t say this but I\\'ll say it anyway you\\'re better-looking including the men including the men now you\\'re all looking good since my election the number of new business applications for New Mexico has increased by almost 30% more than any state in the United States think of that more than any state in the United States so essentially that\\'s saying you\\'re in a certain category which is a very important category you\\'re doing better than any state in the United States how do I lose New Mexico explain that one right how do I lose that one and yet for whatever reason it\\'s been quite a while since a Republican won this state but we\\'re gonna win the state I think we\\'re going to win the savings you had to see the people all the way in from the airport that was a long drive by the way 35 minutes that was a long drive but all the way in we had people and they were waving and I didn\\'t see any negative hand gesture right now I think we\\'re gonna do great here we\\'re here for a number of reasons but we\\'re here because we really think we\\'re going to turn this state and make it a Republican state yesterday marked the beginning of the Hispanic Heritage Month who is Hispanic here Latinos fitrah credible people but we have much to celebrate unbelievable when you think the unemployment for Hispanic Americans is right now at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country Hispanic American poverty reached a brand-new all-time low in history and after years of stagnation that you know very well wages for Hispanic Americans are rising really fast up nearly 8 percent since my election those are unheard of numbers and medium income think of that median income for Hispanic Americans surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever that\\'s your median that\\'s not bad that means you\\'re wealthy and you\\'re getting wealthier fast and I just want to tell you it\\'s an honor but you know when I\\'m at the debate stage debating one of these far left radical Democrats who ever made and they start telling you what they going to do for you and you say but we have the best numbers every category that we\\'ve ever had Hispanic Americans excuse me New Mexico as a whole we have the best numbers african-americans the best numbers that we\\'ve ever had in the history of our country Asian Americans the best numbers that we\\'ve ever had in history women the best numbers that we\\'ve had in 71 years we\\'re working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for nations Hispanic American citizens including millions and millions of extraordinary mexican-americans who enrich our society strengthen our country serve in our military and contribute immensely to our shared American family and I want to just tell you that Mexico is doing a great job for us on the border and I want to thank the President of Mexico [Applause] and it\\'s very interesting I hear everybody screaming well you know we\\'re building the wall and it\\'s going up and it\\'s going up and if you think that\\'s easy with the Democrats who control the house we have to take it back but if you think it\\'s easy but we\\'re building a lot of wall we\\'ll have almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year and it\\'s making a big difference 500 but you know we want a big case two months ago in the Supreme Court that allowed us to do what we\\'re doing this has been I\\'ll tell you what ready another president would have given up a long time ago we don\\'t give up so we\\'re building the wall the Army Corps of Engineers we\\'re doing a beautiful job it\\'s a great it\\'s a great structure the great structure you\\'re gonna have to really want to get over that wall to do it but you know it was very interesting because not too long ago I saw where the Hispanic American the Hispanics were up with me in a poll 17% and everyone said how is that seventeen up by 70% I won\\'t even tell you what the final number was because they won\\'t believe it but you\\'re going to see what the final number but you know why because the Hispanic Americans they understand they don\\'t want criminals coming across the border they don\\'t want people taking their jobs they want to have that security and they want the wall they want the wall and we have a man in the audience who is I think the best dressed man in this entire place including me right here look at him come here look at him look at this guy and he\\'s been to a couple of rallies too haven\\'t you huh we have some people a group of people the other day you know we had a victory in North Carolina that was unbelievable two of them one of them it was going to be very very close is another one of my friends thank you I like that beautiful red tie you\\'re wearing it but we had a victory two victories North Carolina where one was 17 points down three weeks ago we got involved we started sending out lots of different social media messages we did a couple of little robo calls but the big thing we did a speech the night before the turnout was beyond belief and instead of being down by 17 points he easily won the election four or five thousand votes Dan thank you Dan thank you Dan bishop and Greg Murphy was up a couple of points and he ended up winning I don\\'t not ask the media but they won\\'t give me how many what did he get you know like 20 21 he won by a lot he won by a lot I\\'d asked him but we\\'re not gonna get a straight answer they were not happy I\\'ll tell you Tuesday night the fake news was not happy you know they had their studios all built CNN had there a list talent they don\\'t have a list talent but they had the best they could and they were all set this was going to be the end of Trump because this man was going to lose but he turned out to be tough and smart and I in all fairness I helped a lot too and toward the end of the night they started dismantling that studio probably would have been there for four weeks this is the end but we had two great victories congressional victories on Tuesday night and it was something the one gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible so much and the other one a race that he was way way way back in fact I shouldn\\'t tell you this but my geniuses my people some of those people standing right there some of them right there they said sir don\\'t get involved in that race sir you can\\'t come back from 17-point sir it\\'s too much I said but you know I really liked the guy I think he\\'s great let\\'s give it a shot they say sir if you lose they will never ever it\\'ll be much worse I said let me tell you I know them very well whether I help him or don\\'t help him it\\'s going to be the same it\\'s going to be a disaster so let\\'s help them and we campaigned and we worked hard they said don\\'t do it sir don\\'t do it please don\\'t do it sir it\\'ll be very embarrassing I said no I don\\'t mind being embarrassed I don\\'t mind being embarrassed we\\'re also very proud that unemployment among Native Americans has reached the lowest rate in nearly two decades and we\\'re building an amazing future for citizens of every background race religion color and Creed and that\\'s what we have that\\'s what we have race religion color and Creed but the radical left Democrats want to demolish everything that we\\'ve gained they want to raise your taxes they want to bury you in regulation they want to take away your health insurance a hundred and eighty million American they want to erase American history crush religious liberty indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology and left-wing Democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your god-given right to self-defense you know that as your president I will never allow them to take away your Liberty your dignity your Social Security and I will never ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms the left tries to threaten bully intimidate Americans into submission they use Democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can they\\'ll do whatever they can to demean you to libel you they try to blacklist coerce cancel or destroy anyone who gets in their way look at what they\\'re doing today to justice Cavanaugh look at what they\\'re doing did you see the New York Times did you see what they\\'re doing did you see what Democrats they\\'re calling for his resignation they\\'re calling for his impeachment and the woman involved said she didn\\'t know anything she does but they still so the New York Times had to put out a major apology and they had to change their story the woman said I don\\'t remember that cable and they still want him to be a beach and I just put out a statement and he\\'s a great man by the way great talent a great brilliant man Brett Kavanaugh and I just put out a statement on social media that said I don\\'t think they\\'ll do it but they should for the good of the nation I call for the resignation of everybody at the New York Times involved in the Cavanaugh here stone and while you\\'re at it the Russian witch-hunt hoax which is just as phony a story they\\'ve taken the old gray lady do you know the New York Times for years the old gray lady so procedures they\\'ve taken the old great lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation she can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management The Times is dead long live the New York Times long live the New York Times and I do want it to live but they have to be they have to change their ways think of it they wrote a story about somebody that said she doesn\\'t remember this can you even believe it and yet all of these radical left crazies on Judiciary Committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country with all that we have going with Saudi Arabia with Iran with China trade deal with Russia with North Korea with all that we have God look at the cards that we\\'ve been dealt lucky we won the election in 2016 believe me with all that we have gone they say let\\'s impeach justice Cavanaugh one of the smartest most brilliant students top at Yale incredible life incredible family let\\'s impeach him it\\'s a made-up story let\\'s impeach President Trump think of that the Muller report came out think of this this crazy mullah report comes out 18 Trump haters Liberal Democrats some work for Hillary Clinton they found nothing now think of it after two years they found nothing they spent forty million dollars there\\'s not a person in the room that I couldn\\'t find something on with that they spent they give it they found nothing no collusion no obstruction no nothing to stop the far loves campaign of destruction you must vote Republican and you\\'re gonna get the chance for Issa we\\'re joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders and somebody that\\'s done an incredible job she ran Michigan for me and as you know for the presidential races Michigan hadn\\'t been won in decades and she kept saying good you come back sir I didn\\'t know who she was I said who the heck is the woman in Michigan that keeps asking she said serve you keep coming back you\\'re gonna win Michigan has it been won in decades and I won Michigan remember that great great remember that great great night Donald Trump has won the great state of Michigan and they were going crazy on television they were going that was not a good night for certain people remember the couple of people that were crying I guess they don\\'t like a strong military they don\\'t like cutting regulations they don\\'t like low taxes they don\\'t like right to trial you know right to try all these things we\\'ve done for the vets we got choice we got choice for them and choice everybody said it was impossible we\\'ve rebuilt our military I told the story for the first time today a general came into my office and my first few weeks you remember was a little dangerous out there President Obama left us with a few beauties right and I said to this general you better be prepared because this is looking like it could really be conflict and he looked at me and he goes sir we have very little ammunition I said say it again and I want to tell you the words very little he didn\\'t use because it was less than that and I said I never want to see a president in a position like that well we may have conflict and a general looks at him and said we have very little / no ammunition I never want a President of the United States to be in that position and since then three years seven hundred billion dollars we\\'ve spent then seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars and now seven hundred and thirty eight billion dollars and our military is by far the greatest in the world there\\'s nobody that even so anyone no president should ever be put in that position and by the way no president should ever have to go through what I\\'ve gone through either that should never happen what happened is a disgrace to our country no president should ever have to go through and I\\'ll tell you what 99% of them would never have been able to take it they wouldn\\'t have been able to take it but we won the great state of Michigan and now we\\'re doing really well because we\\'ve moved a lot of car companies I tell Japan sorry big deficits with all these countries we\\'re changing it but you got to get car companies we\\'re building car companies now in Michigan they\\'re not going to be leaving for lots of other countries including China including Mexico they\\'re gonna stay home and they\\'re gonna pay you a lot of money and everybody\\'s gonna be happy but Michigan\\'s doing great and Ronna McDaniel was the Republican Party chair of Michigan so when we won the election I said let\\'s get the woman from Michigan to run the RNC and she has done an incredible job thank you Ron a great gentleman who loves the Republican Party co-chairman Tommy Hicks Tommy what a job New Mexico Republican Party Chairman Steve Pierce [Music] my friend and a really talented guy he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time Brad parse Kel what a job he\\'s doing bread great job great job and another great friend of mine somebody that was on CNN and they didn\\'t like him because he was too positive on Trump can you believe it he happens to be Hispanic he happens to be Hispanic but I\\'ve never quite figured it out because he looks more like a wasp than I do so I haven\\'t figured that one out but I\\'ll tell you what there is nobody that loves this country more or Hispanic more than Steve Cortese Steve thank you sir nobody loves the Hispanics more who do you like more the country or the Hispanics he says the country I don\\'t know why I may have to go for the Hispanics to be other thing we got a lot of Hispanics we love our Hispanics get out and vote you know just before the last election the Cubans from Miami where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90 percent they gave me the Bay of Pigs award can you imagine right the Bay of Pigs award and the Venezuelans and the Cubans are all for Trump I will tell you that they\\'re all for trouble they like what we\\'re doing with the help of and Steve I want to thank you very much by the way and you were incredible on CNN and now you\\'ll get a real job okay Steve that audience wasn\\'t big enough for you their ratings aren\\'t good with the help of everyone here tonight we\\'re taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the great people of our country and to the people of New Mexico we\\'ve cut a record number of job-killing regulations saving the average American household $3,000 we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history and what that means is a typical family of four in New Mexico making $75,000 has seen their tax bill reduced by more than $2,000 and it\\'s one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great you look at Europe and you look at Asia and China is not doing too well must be honest with you worst year in 57 years I\\'d say that\\'s not good but I hope they still like me and we\\'ve taken in tens of billions of dollars worth of tariffs and we\\'ve given those tariffs and by the way China\\'s eating the tariffs are devaluing their currency the prices are very similar they\\'re reading the tariffs and out of the tens of billions we gave our great farmers because they were targeted by China because China knows very smart that the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers I said to our I said to our Secretary of Agriculture sonny Perdue I said Sonny how much did the farmers get hit by by China targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things he said 16 billion dollars I said that\\'s okay we\\'ll take 16 billion dollars out of a much much much larger number we\\'re going to give it to the farmers so that they\\'re even and I tell you the farmers do love Trump out there and to keep New Mexico\\'s farms ranches and small businesses in the family we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farmer your wrench to your children now if you don\\'t like your children don\\'t do it but when it\\'s your time to kick the bucket you worked hard you have great kids you love you kids they\\'re taking care of you you really love them it\\'s a great thing if you don\\'t love them don\\'t even listen to the last line because it won\\'t matter don\\'t leave it to them if they\\'re not good leave it to charity leave it to something else don\\'t give it I know a guy can\\'t stand his children they\\'re horrible horrible human beings they\\'re a little older now but they\\'re horrible human beasts he wants to leave his wealth they said why would you leave them they don\\'t even like you but on the assumption that you love your children you\\'ll be able to your small farms and your ranches and things you\\'ll be able to leave them to your children your children won\\'t have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax they won\\'t be losing it to the banks five years later we got rid of it that\\'s a big deal thank you thank you our shared Republican agenda is pro-worker pro-jobs pro-family pro-growth and 100% pro-american for many decades our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests you know that in New Mexico you know exactly what I\\'m talking about people came in they took your jobs they had no border they had no border control look look at what\\'s going on now how we\\'re doing I mean honestly I mentioned the President of Mexico we have today 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the border protecting our country and I\\'ll take them because all Lords are so bad they\\'re so pathetic and the Democrats could change these laws they could change him so quickly we could change them all in less than an hour we could whether it\\'s asylum whether it\\'s any of the laws we have so many of them that are so bad how they got that that took years and years to end up but we have the Mexican soldiers out there you see them and they\\'re stopping people the numbers are plummeting down so I just want to thank all of the representatives of Mexico amazing well we got to get rid of the loopholes you know the word is loopholes and the Democrats could do it fast but in the meantime we\\'re doing really well and as the wall goes up it becomes less and less of a problem because as the wall gets up people aren\\'t getting through I mean you got to be a a world-class pole vaulter or a world-class mount everest type climber there\\'s not too many around like that it\\'s really doing the trick the failed liberal establishment in Washington squandered your tax dollars shipped away your jobs sacrifice your sovereignty and bogged us down in one foreign war or debacle call it whatever you want after another and that\\'s changing also you see what\\'s happening and when these rich countries think we\\'re going to pay for their military every year billions and billions and billions and they\\'re rich and they take our business and we\\'re supposed to on top of everything else I could tell you stories but I\\'m going to save them for the campaign you know because to be honest this is a little earlier than the campaign later this campaign starts you know like I was telling bread and I was telling a few of the folks one thing I don\\'t want to do might go back to him Michael hello my what a job he\\'s done but I\\'m telling them I don\\'t want to do this too early I don\\'t want to do it you know the Pocahontas thing I did that it was before its time right he\\'s before a child too early 1024 that means I have more Indian blood than she does and I have none unfortunately I\\'d like to say I have a lot that would get me another 4% maybe another 10% but I was early with her and frankly uh oh it\\'s coming back don\\'t worry about but those days are over under this administration we are finally putting America first [Applause] we\\'re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land you see the factories empty buildings empty hulks some have been demolished some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing but all those jobs are gone and we\\'re bringing them back they\\'re coming back like almost never before probably I can say they\\'re coming back like never before people are coming back down because they want to be where the action is and this is the country where they have the security and where they do have the action in my first week in office I proudly withdrew from the last administration\\'s job destroying cat and and this was a catastrophe you know with the trans-pacific partnership TPP this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country now New Mexico you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as NAFTA [Applause] your state lost 33% of its manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was son this was one of the great catastrophes and now we\\'re replacing NAFTA with the brand-new US Mexico Canada agreement u.s. MCA think of the song YMCA YMCA think of the song u.s. MCA that\\'s us Mexico Canada agreement and it\\'s drawing strong bipartisan support from all across your state and all across the country it\\'s amazing I want to just the Dona Ana County Board of Commissioners all Democrats just unanimously endorsed the u.s. MCA and urged Congress to pass it immediately thank you very much commissioners all Democrats hopefully they\\'ll put it up for a vote Nancy Pelosi they put it up for a vote it\\'s going to be very popular the Republicans love it and the Democrats love it and frankly labor loves it unions love it farmers love love love it and everybody wants it your farmers your ranchers everybody wants it it\\'s an incredible agreement and Mexico has already passed it and Canada is ready to pass it as soon as we do see they don\\'t maybe trust us that\\'s why I say why aren\\'t you passing it now they say all will pass it they\\'re gonna pass it as soon as we do past leaders invited China to freely loot and pillage the United States economy China\\'s been taking out from 300 billion to 500 billion dollars a year billion not million billion think of what five hundred billion dollars as we\\'ve rebuilt China but now it\\'s a different ballgame somebody had to do something with China President Obama should have done it Presidents Bush should have done it President Clinton should have done it they all should have done it frankly they all should have done a lot of things that we\\'re doing right now so if you look at it nobody did it so I\\'m doing it and that\\'s what\\'s going to happen so now we\\'re taking in billions and billions of dollars from China when in the past we never got 10 cents we never got money we never got anything you know we got unemployment and losses and some cheap pencils more than we needed you could do with one less pencil following decades of outsourcing and offshoring our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong if foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs there is one very simple solution come and make your product in America come and make your product in New Mexico and by the way I\\'m just seeing this great group of people the spirit is there any place in the world that\\'s more fun or more exciting than a Trump rally really and when you think about it it\\'s not about fun it\\'s about achievement because what we\\'ve achieved in the last almost three years is unparalleled there\\'s never been an administration that in the first two and a half years has done what we\\'ve been able to do or two in a few short weeks we\\'ll be up to 180 sounds impossible federal judges including Court of Appeals judges because President Obama did us a great favor when I came in I said I assume I have no judges to appoint no sir you have 138 judges 138 didn\\'t put them up couldn\\'t get him approved I don\\'t know what happened but we started off with 138 now we\\'re up to 180 I just signed my one hundred and fiftieth federal judge and Court of Appeals judge and we already have two great Supreme Court justices forces and Cavanaugh great great men so think of that you know you come in and I\\'ve always heard the most important thing a president does I disagree with this by the way but that\\'s okay I disagree with a lot of things because I think the most important thing is our military and protecting our country right but if you listen to the so-called Washington elite now why are they elite we do better than they do we\\'re smarter than them we make more money we have better houses we have better everything and then they say the elite that means you\\'re the super elite [Music] I\\'ve always taken offense when somebody said President Trump is tired of listening to the elite I said don\\'t know I\\'m more elite than them I mean if we go by the old Sanders about our houses better schools made much more money lived better had everything going and then I decide to run for president and I\\'ll be I\\'ll be honest well we have to put up with these people and and others are it\\'s incredible but it\\'s the greatest single decision I\\'ve ever made because our country is turning around so rapidly I could not be happier despite what they put us all through after years of building up other countries we\\'re finally building up our country isn\\'t that nice it\\'s time to finally take care of our own and we\\'re also aggressively combating the opioid epidemic which is horrible and as a result of our non-stop efforts and billions and billions of dollars invested last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths and it was a very big decline in nearly three decades 30 years and at the center of America\\'s drug crisis this is where the Hispanics know it better than anybody people said all the Hispanics won\\'t like a wall I said I think they\\'re gonna love it they won\\'t like border security I think they\\'re gonna love it you know why because you understand it better than other people but as the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in and you understand that when other people don\\'t understand it the border crisis everyday dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your southern border including heroin meth cocaine and fentanyl and we\\'re stopping them now you see the kind of numbers were getting millions and millions and millions of dollars worth we\\'ve had some shipments where it could kill half of the country some of the fentanyl and some of the bad really bad stuff if it were distribute it could actually has the power to kill half of the country this is like a war like situation that\\'s why you\\'re liking Trump because you\\'re not gonna let that happen if you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women that\\'s what they traffic in it\\'s women they\\'re not trafficking in men they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don\\'t go through ports of entry well you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else they go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in but now when you have a wall they can\\'t do that right and so many of these Democrats that are against the what\\'s common-sense look you know what I saw the other day where the Democrats are having their convention their National Convention they just gave out a tremendous contract you know what it\\'s for they\\'re building a big wall around the building they\\'re building a big wall a massive wall we should tell them open borders let anybody come in and a few years ago almost every one of these they\\'re on tape that\\'s the problem with politics three years ago they could say look I saw Senator Schumer I saw a Nancy Pelosi all of them they said no we need a wall we must have a wall we must have President Obama we must have a wall we must stop people from coming into our country illegally we have to stop it we need a wall now a few years later they don\\'t want a wall you know why because anything I want they want to do the opposite and that\\'s okay that\\'s the only reason but if you want to stop the drug smugglers human traffickers and vicious mas three gang members which were taking out every year by the thousands and getting them the hell out of our country because of ice and if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth you know it\\'s poisoning our you that\\'s what it is there\\'s nothing other than that first simple they\\'re poisoning our youth you have only one choice you must elect Republicans and to be honest with you you\\'ve got to elect President Trump we need four more years how about these phony Democrats they started with Russia Russia Russia that turned out to be a fraud that turned out to be a fraud then they went to race do you believe that one race I\\'m the least racist person in this room then they went to recession there\\'s gonna be a recessional please let there be researcher please because we have a better chance of defeating him if there\\'s a recession and unfortunately the stock markets only a few points from its all-time high which we\\'ve broken on I think it\\'s well over a hundred times we broke the all-time record and now they have a new one that I\\'m enriching myself limited by doing this and taking this particular job which I love it will cost me billions and billions of dollars but if somebody from the Middle East that I never saw before comes in and stays at one of my hotels for an evening and pays four hundred and thirty nine dollars in monument\\'s nobody ever heard the word of margin before emolument nobody ever heard that word in Monument he\\'s enriching himself if somebody buys a tank of gas in Scotland from an airport that I don\\'t know and they happen to go to a hotel he\\'s enriching himself like twenty people I\\'m gonna lose billions of dollars and that\\'s okay I expected to do that when I did it I didn\\'t know what would happen if I lost can you imagine supposing I lost and we would have had the same basic rhetoric I mean winning was great supposing you know I\\'m doing all the things I\\'m telling you all the same sort of things supposing I didn\\'t make it I\\'d have to go around I would have lost in lost billions then I would have been really unhappy but I\\'ll tell you what I expected that when I did this in terms of opportunity in terms of certain places they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric they can never do so I\\'ll lose billions of dollars always expected they say I enrich myself because somebody\\'s going to stay at my hotel it doesn\\'t work that way folks and these are very very dishonest people and they know it so they\\'ve given up on every other you know it - you get it the Democratic gender of open borders places vast burdens on your communities and your schools and your hospitals and Public Safety all at the expense of hard-working New Mexico families and throughout our country sheriffs and commissioners from nine Mexico counties recently sent a letter to your state\\'s congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in New Mexico they don\\'t want open borders they don\\'t want criminals pouring into your communities and doing what they do and we won\\'t even talk about that they want strong these are people that are with you in many cases Democrats they write letters we need strong border security you know in San Diego California is very difficult always complaining not doing great but they wanted a wall in San Diego good mayor in San Diego by the way they wanted a wall and I said you know what let\\'s build it someplace else because California you know once we build it they\\'ll complain but then I said you know the people are pouring in they needed it they\\'re pouring into San Diego like going all over the place and people that had houses they didn\\'t like people running over their gardens all day long coming in from the other side so we put up a wall and I thought everybody would be happy as soon as it was finished the dad was finished I was notified we didn\\'t want the wall why did you do the wall and I will tell you in other words so all the game I\\'d love to take the sucker down and move it right down to New Mexico and if I did that they\\'d go crazy and they\\'d say please sir don\\'t do that please please the same people that are saying we don\\'t want a wall why did you put up a wall and I knew that was gonna happen I told my people that was gonna happen but they\\'re very happy with their wall they most of them won\\'t say it they love it it stopped it only stopped 99.9% of the people coming in and the only reason I\\'m not moving into New Mexico is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new beautiful wall so I\\'ll give you a break it\\'s true I actually priced it out it\\'s true all these contractors all my life I\\'ve been deal they can find a way to make money sir of course more money to move the wall that the build a new one they have there they have it but the the Commission your commissioners wrote I quote our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing this is your commissioners writing to us in Washington our scarce resources are in danger being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens you and our existing homeless populations many of whom are American veterans right so Democrats put illegal aliens before American citizens Republicans believe that we must take care of our own citizens first I\\'m sorry that includes millions of hard-working lawful immigrants who waited in line followed the rules and came into our country legally and among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are Hispanic Americans who obey our laws pay their taxes contribute to our communities and play by the rules and they\\'re the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it whether you\\'re a first generation or a tenth generation every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs your safety your family and is always loyal to you your politicians have not been loyal to you they\\'ve been loyal to themselves [Applause] the Democrats are also trying to turn every city in America into a sanctuary for criminal element [Applause] and that\\'s one of the very good reasons we won on Tuesday night North Carolina because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did I will not tell you tonight but it wasn\\'t good it\\'s one of the reasons we had big victories two of them in North Carolina sanctuary cities and plenty of people even in California where they have sanctuary cities they don\\'t want sanctuary cities the politicians do but they don\\'t want them right here in New Mexico Democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail now think of it they want to make your whole state a sanctuary state so when ms-13 comes in and I told you before we take them out by the thousands and they\\'re tough they\\'re tough but our ice folks are even tougher there\\'s nobody fat but you\\'re I would say naive but maybe it\\'s much worse than they\\'re naive these politicians the naive politicians they don\\'t want ice to come in they don\\'t want to take these criminals out and if you don\\'t take them out and they\\'re in New Mexico I got to tell you something folks you got problems you got problems you got big problems Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans not for criminal alien and Republicans will always support the heroes of ice Border Patrol and our great law enforcement the Democrat Party do you notice I always say the Democrat Party you know before I came they were all current Democratic because it sounds better right it does it\\'s much nicer the Democratic Party is much nicer than the Democrat Party but their name is the Democrat Party and I\\'m not looking for them to sound nice I want to give their name so I always say the Democrat Party but that\\'s their name the Democrat Party frankly they should probably change it because it does and then I call them the Democratic Party but the Democrat Party has never been farther outside the mainstream every major that\\'s a nasty fly I don\\'t like those suckers I don\\'t know about you in New Mexico but I\\'m not into flies or mosquitoes I don\\'t like steaks too much we have plenty of them in New York and Washington a different variety I don\\'t like snakes either we got a lot of snakes in Washington DC we got a lot of steaks in New York I don\\'t like either kind of snake I think I like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in every major Democrat running for president supports a massive government takeover of health care that would destroy Medicare as we know it today my administration will protect Medicare and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions the Republicans will always do that our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 50 years you don\\'t hear this because the fake news does who want to write about [Applause] you know sometimes I\\'ll have a news conference about something that\\'s so good and I\\'ll say you know I\\'ll call my wife first lady first lady people love our first I\\'ll say when you see television tonight or we did something that was so great whatever it may be we did a lot of things we did something so great and it won\\'t beyond but if there\\'s something that\\'s just slightly negative or even if it\\'s good that they can turn negative that\\'s what they like best take something good and turn it negative it\\'s breaking we have breaking news we are breaking them ah these are phony people but that\\'s okay you know when you think of it I\\'m president and they\\'re not it\\'s grown you know sometimes I\\'ll be in the Oval Office and I\\'ll be with my people we have great people and I say you know and it\\'s great calm in the Oval Office you don\\'t like to hear about it because you don\\'t hear about it too much that\\'s what not worth it but we have great calm considering it\\'s pretty wild stuff going on in the world right but I\\'ll be saying you know they don\\'t treat us right they don\\'t treat us right it\\'s not fair it\\'s not this and then I\\'ll just sit back I\\'ll say but we\\'re in the Oval Office and they\\'re not it\\'s pretty amazing and when you have the Democrat Party and the press the media the lamestream media the fake news and their partners they are partners okay remember the word manufactured they use the word manufacturer or something never been used for that thing and every news gets the manufactured crisis started the next one this crisis was manufactured every one of them used the word manufactured they know what I\\'m talking about now that\\'s called collusion folks that\\'s real collusion no you have that and so you have the Democrats you have the media their partners then you have the deep stake we\\'re getting rid of a lot of them I\\'ll tell you we\\'re finding them left and right fooled you take a look at what I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll tell you what you take a look at what we\\'re doing with all of the things I\\'m not going to get into detail but you know what I\\'m talking about clean the swamp that\\'s the ultimate cleaning of the swamp and then I hate to say this but we have some Republicans they\\'re not good you call a marina they\\'re rhinos the Rhinos are worse and some of them are worse than the Obama people right they\\'re worse than the Obama people they\\'re worse than the Clinton people but there aren\\'t too many of them left they\\'re pretty much on respirators that gasping they\\'re gasping for air but we do have some bad people that you wouldn\\'t believe I didn\\'t hear you what did you say what I didn\\'t hear that virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth and that\\'s why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God right I see it just like mom I see it Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion and socialism the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and it is the party of the American dream [Music] we\\'ve achieved record funding for the US military all of that money trillions and trillions of dollars spent all produced right here in the good old USA and I have to tell you New Mexico I know you\\'re gonna like this a lot of those trillions because you know when you do the seven sixteen and the seven thirty and the seven hundred billion all of a sudden you\\'re in trillions and I can save a lot of lines when I just say trillions a lot of that money is going to be spent in a state-of-the-art military equipment that\\'s being used at Holloman Air Force Base White Sands Missile Range Kirtland Air Force Base and many other vital New Mexico military installations that are going up as we speak that\\'s also jobs but more importantly that even jobs incredible what you\\'ve done for the military New Mexico is incredible and we\\'ve remembered but we\\'re pouring a lot of money into New Mexico and that means a lot of good thing and we\\'re investing in our nation\\'s nuclear security including right here in New Mexico and Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory to protect America\\'s security I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal it was no good and we oppose the toughest-ever sanctions on the Iranian regime watch how that works out folks gonna be very good I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in and don\\'t forget what I did for Israel with respect to Golan Heights don\\'t forget right for years you watch as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for New Mexico and you must never forget get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody we need it because we\\'re fighting a lot of forces including Facebook I saw and Google I saw did you see Google he said I may have lost two million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google right and we still want how the hell did we win everybody was against us how did we win how did we win this is a Google executive from 2 million to 10.5 million votes and we won I don\\'t now we must be doing I will say this that happened and people came from the valleys they came from everywhere they came from places that nobody\\'s ever talked about before and it was the Forgotten men and women but the truth is I know these men and women and they\\'re the most incredible men and women in this country they really are they just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time they didn\\'t want to get out there they said ah boy oh boy is this the best they can do I mean in all fairness I don\\'t want to go too early here look at the field did you watch the debate the other day we\\'ve got almost 350 million people I\\'ll take it that\\'s the best they can go we\\'ll see we\\'ll see you never want to get too cocky somebody said in the great state of Texas Donald Trump is down two points to boot edge edge boot agent [Applause] Funes edge their phony pulse you know they have phony pulse I told the story the other night for six months I was hearing that I\\'m gonna lose the state of Texas and friends of mine from Texas that looked just like these guys with CD two guys with a hat they might even be better looking they look just like and they\\'re on to say I don\\'t know about you but I know a lot about Texas and Donald Trump is not going to be losing the state of Texas remember that see they don\\'t say it\\'s in play they\\'re too smart they say Texas is in play and Utah they said was in play all these are in play and play means we could lose them right it\\'s a better term though because this way they can\\'t get skunked but they can get skunked with me so what happens is on that beautiful election that was that one of the greatest coolest nights ever well you know they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you\\'re winning by a lot this is six months Texas is in play you know he could lose Texas I keep saying I go to a stadium we sell out to thousands of people lines at a miles long I mean in every friend of mine says you\\'re gonna win by a lot so they announced eight o\\'clock whatever time the polls in Texas sir closed Donald Trump has won the state of Texas the polls in Utah are clothes Donald Trump has won the state of Utah they don\\'t even take a breath now if it\\'s close like it\\'s in play you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is but they don\\'t even take a breath because they\\'re called suppression polls and they\\'re no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say they\\'re no different there\\'s suppression balls and I\\'ll tell you what we\\'re gonna win the state of New Mexico and I\\'ll be so surprised now we\\'re gonna win New Mexican Oh what I came here during the last election came here little because I was told very hard to win and I came here a little but I saw a great spirit but I didn\\'t really have a track record because you know I never did this stuff before so I said I was going to cut your taxes I did I said I was going to cut your regulations I did more than any president in history and they\\'ve been there for many years I\\'ve been there for Dora and I think the regulation cutting like the waters of the u.s. that was another beauty where you couldn\\'t build a house you couldn\\'t farm your land now what we\\'ve done on regulations is incredible I\\'ve done I\\'ve rebuilt our military I\\'ve taken care of our vets look how happy our vets are with choice instead of waiting for two months to see a doctor or two weeks or three days they now go out if there\\'s a wait they go out they get a private doctor they get taken care of we pay the bill and for the first time they\\'ve tried to get that for forty five years they haven\\'t been able to get it but I\\'m good at getting things you must never forget the 2020 election is about one thing what\\'s it about about you it is it\\'s about you it\\'s about you you know I\\'m doing you a good job as your messenger but basically I\\'m a messenger I know what you want I understand it it\\'s about your family it\\'s about your future and it\\'s about the fate of your country for your children for everybody it\\'s about the fate of your country it\\'s about the future of our great country no matter what label they use a vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream that\\'s what it\\'s about look at Venezuela Venezuela 15 years ago was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and today very sad no food no water no nothing socialism we begin this campaign with the best record the best results the best agenda and the only positive vision for America and it\\'s not just a little bit positive our country is going to be greater than it ever was that\\'s where we\\'re headed together we will help millions more citizens know the dignity of work the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done with your help we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe modern fair and very lawful system of immigration [Applause] and we\\'re gonna have a lot done anyway we already do have a lot then you saw the figures last week but we\\'re doing it the hard way would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful beautiful words that incredible phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years that we\\'ve already started that program it will happen we have the medicine nobody even knew that the AIDS epidemic in this country will be gone within 10 years we\\'ve already started the process it\\'s been funded it\\'s been funded who would have thought that honestly when I ran I didn\\'t know that we have now the technology and what they\\'ve done with respect to AIDS is incredible what a terrible terrible period of time the world went through but we will have it ended within 10 years we will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses cars healthcare lightbulbs right they took away our light bulb I want an incandescent light I want to look better ok I want to pay less money to look better does that make sense [Music] you pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that with the new bulbs if they break it\\'s considered a hazardous waste site it\\'s all gases inside and you\\'re supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container give me a break I asked the people the professionals well what do people do when it breaks cuz they break all the time what do they do nothing they throw it away so I a lot of people didn\\'t know they didn\\'t understand you get a much better light at a much reduced cost and it\\'s much safer because when those other bulbs break they really are dangerous the gases come out they\\'re dangerous these are the little things that I have to explain otherwise people to say what the hell are you doing with light bulbs work and we\\'re trying to do the same thing with cars cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline they have so much junk that they\\'re less safe so what I want to do is the following under our rules and regulations the cars are environmentally terrific but they\\'re safer and they\\'re $3,500 less to buy and the reason they\\'re safer is because they can be a little bit heavier make sense right they could be a little bit heavier I mean they make them now like paper mache somebody touches them in the entire car collapses when somebody hits me I want to be in as close to an army tank as possible now they\\'re made out of paper mache they weigh about three pounds and if you get hit by a bus it\\'s over they say what happened to that car no I think of it it\\'s safer and it\\'s less expensive by three thousand five hundred dollars on average and California wants you to do the other cars and we don\\'t we\\'re going to end up in a big litigation and I\\'m fighting for you look look it\\'s it\\'s not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say I let it pay more let it be unsafe they listen to the environmentalists and I\\'m an environmentalist I believe in the environment I want the cleanest water on the planet I want the cleanest air I want a lot of things you know right now we have the cleanest air that we\\'ve ever had at this contract but what are they going to do about China and India and Russia and other countries that are spewing stuff what do we doing about them we\\'re gonna keep our suit nice and clean but you know the universe is so big that when you talk about China the USA India you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out right it\\'s so big that it\\'s right next to each other it\\'s right next to each other does that make sense right it\\'s right next to each other so what are they going to do we want to have the cleanest water in the cleanest air we will defend privacy we will defend free speech free assembly religious liberty and we will always proudly defend your Second Amendment that we\\'re doing it and above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life we believe that mothers and fathers not Washington bureaucrats know best how to raise their strong beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always respect our great American flag and we will always live by the words of our national motto nobody will ever take it down nobody will ever take it down we will never allow them to take it down In God We Trust we stand on the shoulders of American patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it won\\'t even be close and we\\'re right there our ancestors cross the oceans settle the continent tame the wilderness revolutionized industry pioneered scientists one two world wars defeated fascism and communism put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world and every day of my presidency we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us the future belongs to each and every one of you with your help your devotion and your drive [Applause] yay [Applause] it\\'s too bad he did it right in the crescendo how do you top that I\\'m just ready the big beautiful crescendo and this characters going back home alright it\\'s two people tonight remember when they say massive protests at the Trump rally two people [Applause] with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning

that it seems like yesterday for the next 13 months we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020 America now has the number-one economy anywhere in the world that it\\'s not even close you know I\\'m dealing with China right now there in Washington we\\'re gonna see if we make a deal but they want to make it we\\'re going to determine whether or not we want to make it but they\\'ve been very nice and today I got a call from one of the top representatives he said congratulations mr. president on having a truly great great economy that\\'s pretty nice [Applause] we picked up since the election trillions of dollars in value and China has lost trillions of dollars in value I will say this if our opponent had won that election you know what would have happened right now China would become the night it would be the number one economy anywhere in the world and right now I can tell you they\\'re not even close our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting for the first time in a long time we are putting America first [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and I have to say there are a lot of very beautiful red t-shirts in the audience [Music] [Applause] that was a record sale they did very well and I\\'ll tell you what cops love Trump Trump loves cops our bowl pursuit of this pro-american agenda has ingrates and you know what\\'s happened it\\'s enraged the failed ruling class in Washington not easy to get them out but we\\'re doing it slowly but surely these corrupt politicians and the radical leftist got rich bleeding America dry and they knew that my election would finally end they\\'re pillaging and looting of our country and that\\'s what they were doing and that\\'s what they continue to try and do that is why from day one the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election the election of 2016 they\\'re trying they\\'re not getting very far they want to erase your vote like it never existed they want to erase your voice and they want to erase your future but they will fail because in America the people rule again do you remember the just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office the Washington Post a terrible newspaper [Music] that doesn\\'t know how to write the truth published a story and in this case they might have gotten it pretty correct they said the campaign to impeach President Trump has begun that was the headline little did we know they weren\\'t playing games think of that that was 19 minutes after the oath of office months earlier Peters struck remember he and his lover Lisa page water group she\\'s going to win ten million to one she\\'s gonna win and I\\'m telling you Peter I\\'m telling you Peter she\\'s gonna win Peter oh I love you so much [Applause] [Music] I love you Peter I love you too Lisa Elise hello Lisa Lisa oh god I love you Lisa and if she doesn\\'t win Lisa we\\'ve got it insurance policy Lisa will get that son of a bitch out we got an insurance fund and we\\'re living through the insurance policy that\\'s what it is the phony Russia hoax Lisa I love you now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate thirteen months I gotta move fast because they\\'re not beating us at the polls and they know it despite the phony despite the phony polls that you see all the time they\\'re phony Paul\\'s you know polls are no different remember he always used to talk about polls I know polls very well polls are no different than crooked writers they\\'re crooked polls the crooked polls no different well that\\'s a lot of media look back there that\\'s a lot of media [Music] they are so dishonest and frankly they are so bad for our country they are so bad and they could be so good for our country they could be so good and maybe they\\'ll change and maybe they won\\'t I\\'ve been waiting for a long time you know after I won the last election I said you know finally it\\'s okay finally I\\'ll get some great press they got worse they got worse I said finally we\\'re gonna get I said to the first lady darling we\\'re gonna finally get respect we\\'re gonna finally get media and press coverage that\\'s going to be great look at what we\\'ve done and I\\'m telling you they did they got worse and they know they cannot win you understand well if you didn\\'t understand honestly there\\'s no way anybody could win because you\\'d believe them if you believe them there\\'s no way anybody could reach is just like 94% I can do the greatest things in history and they\\'ll make them bad - very bad and if I do a neutral something neutral worked out okay not grade up it it\\'s like given the electric chair that was terrible right no this is the worst these people and the Democrats they\\'re partners it\\'s a partnership how about on the newscast like the word manufactured its manufacturer manufacturer deal along the border the words never been used by for all of a sudden every newscast is using it it\\'s a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats [Music] [Applause] so they know they can\\'t win the 2020 election so they\\'re pursuing the insane impeachment witch-hunt I\\'ve been going through it now I\\'ve been going through it now for more time than I\\'ve been in office because you know like struck with his insurance deal this was before remember this this was before that statement was made months before I took office that statement was made months before the election took place they said just in case we\\'re gonna have an insurance policy that only means one thing we\\'re gonna get them out so they\\'re telling us we can\\'t let that ever happen again to another president [Applause] [Music] and Rush Limbaugh Sean Hannity a lot of people [Applause] the great Mark Levin we have a lot of great people lou dobbs great people you know what they said every one of them plus many others there\\'s no other man that we\\'ve ever met they could have taken it it\\'s true maybe I\\'m a little different up here I don\\'t know but I enjoy it to me it\\'s I\\'m energized because we\\'re draining the swamp [Applause] the Democrats brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country these are bad people my phone call as an example with the president of Ukraine was perfect everybody that looked at it and the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative so I had no choice and I don\\'t want to do that as president every time a president from a country calls me or I call them we have to release the text how can you do business that way who\\'s gonna want to speak to your president so the president of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference on other subjects that he was under absolutely no pressure he didn\\'t know what they\\'re talking about and he used the word there was no blackmail during this call he used that term so in theory that should be the end of it think of it a President of the United States who\\'s made our economy with a lot of help from all of you frankly but from Mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us we made this the strongest economy in our history we\\'ve rebuilt our military we\\'re taking care of health care like nobody\\'s been able to do what we\\'ve done is incredible and by the way we\\'re protecting your Second Amendment if you don\\'t have me your Second Amendment is gone so we have the greatest economy the greatest military we\\'ve rebuilt our military two and a half trillion dollars because when I took it over it was a mess and what do they want to do let\\'s impeach a president right I don\\'t think so I think we\\'re gonna have a turnout the likes of which we\\'ve never seen in the history of our country so we were really forced just to put it away we were forced I said just do it got the approval from Ukraine have to ask I said hey do you guys mind they said that\\'s a strange request I said don\\'t worry about it do you mind and they said please go ahead nothing was said wrong in that call so we released the transcript of the call which was so good that that crooked atom shift this guy is crooked [Music] he had a make up a fake conversation that never happened and he delivered it to the United States Congress and the American people [Music] it was a total fraud and then Nancy Pelosi said oh I think the president said that [Music] these people are sick I\\'m telling you they\\'re sick and you know what had they waited one day longer they would have had the transcript of the actual code word for word it would have been perfect instead they released it they went early they said all these horrible things you know why because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call [Applause] so Nancy Pelosi upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call or somebody gave her very bad advice but also hearing it from shifty chef Nancy Pelosi said a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian president we\\'ve got to impeach him we\\'ve got to impeach him right and then she saw the call and she said to her people what the hell nobody ever told me this was the call but she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hand [Music] the do-nothing Democratic streamers have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual beautiful accurate phone call with a foreign leader I don\\'t think so as our brilliant white House Counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday he said their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions to our system of free elections and to the American people that\\'s what it is to the American people it\\'s so terrible Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy that\\'s what\\'s happening we will never let it happen we will defeat them I mean look at their debates these people are crazy there one has been 99 trillion dollars to redo buildings all over the United States I said what about China what about Russia what about India what about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out [Applause] it\\'s alright [Music] let him give you the answer [Applause] man did the cops act fast he\\'s already gone [Applause] that\\'s the fastest you know I have look I love law in force but I love the cops I love the police all of it Minneapolis Minneapolis you got a rockin man you got to change your mirror you got a bad man [Applause] got a bad mare but you know what the police I\\'ve done this a lot and every once in a while whoever cut very little disturbance it\\'s really actually is there any place where we could have more fun than at a trump rally [Applause] and we\\'ve said every record at every place virtually that we\\'ve gone and one of the big musicians said and Trump does it without a guitar can you believe it without a guitar but this guy so I\\'ve had it a lot where you know you but sometimes it\\'ll take the police like 30 seconds 50 seconds it\\'s like Roger Penske when you watch him who\\'s getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom by the way spur soon great we won 18 Indy 518 Roger Penske but it\\'s like the way they change those tires takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing I say how the hell do they do it that\\'s the way these cops just reacted [Applause] that was a record I think it was her I\\'ve had good service but I\\'ve never had anything like that I look up the guy who\\'s already gone yeah we love you with the red shirts so now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy Joe sleep each other [Music] and you know what I\\'d love to run against them to be honest anybody like that if you can\\'t beat him in a debate you got a big problem folks think you can\\'t beat him in a debate you can\\'t be President because what are you gonna do against President Xi and Kim Jong born you can\\'t beat slippy Jo but now we\\'re gonna meet with Kim jong-il and I don\\'t think so but he\\'s totally on and totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years two months after President Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy listen to this and the press will not write it they say in totally unsubstantiated charges every time they talk about him President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune now you know that\\'s a totally unsubstantiated judge really it\\'s not unsubstantiated fact Joe\\'s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days by the way whatever happened to hunter where the hell is he [Applause] where\\'s hunter hey fellas I have an idea for a new t-shirt I love the cups but let\\'s do another t-shirt where\\'s hunter [Applause] his hunter being examined by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd or some of these people hunter so great that you\\'re here sir hunter I know they\\'re giving you approximately a hundred and sixty eight thousand dollars a month I hear they paid you a big check of three million dollars I just want to speak on behalf of NBC who\\'s absolutely one of the Wars I just want to tell you hunter I just want to tell you I couldn\\'t be happier for you and your family and I I know you don\\'t know anything about energy and I know it\\'s an energy company but I I think they made a great deal hunter and then they fly to China and I\\'m dealing with people right now they\\'re tough as hell those Chinese negotiators and hunter who\\'s not too smart hunter he goes in he has a meeting he walks out in his fund with 1.5 billion with a be 1.5 billion dollars [Music] these aren\\'t the same Chinese negotiators that I\\'m dealing with I can tell you these are not the same ones but we are doing very well in that negotiation now think of it where\\'s hunter located get it so where is hunter I want to see hunter Estes where hunter you know nothing about energy you know nothing about you know nothing about anything frankly hunter you\\'re a loser why did you get one point five billion dollars hunter [Applause] and your father was never considered smart he was never considered a good senator he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\\'s ass [Music] [Applause] true [Applause] thank you thank you it\\'s true that\\'s true and they\\'re always saying the same thing yeah he got a billion five we admitted they admitted there\\'s nothing but always that same thing President Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about hunter Biden and his father it\\'s not unsubstantiated you crooked son of a guns it\\'s a hundred percent [Applause] [Music] [Applause] even the smart guys on Wall Street and I know all of them they are smart they\\'ve never seen anything like that one before I\\'ve called them does that ever happen never happens guy walks in no experience no nothing walks out with a billion 5g flies in on Air Force two with his father the vice president don\\'t forget that\\'s when he was vice president so China gives his son 1.5 billion how would you like to have joe biden take over negotiations right now with china i don\\'t think so [Music] I don\\'t think so meanwhile Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind and we\\'re not doing that anymore those days are over the Biden\\'s got rich and that is substantiated while America got robbed that\\'s what happened sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America they didn\\'t have tough negotiations I look at these trade deals and I say who the hell could have done this if you didn\\'t if you had no business instinct no business ability if you had nothing if you dumb as hell you wouldn\\'t make these deals they\\'re so bad I say who made these deals who made these deals but we\\'re ripping them all up and redoing them and they\\'re gonna be very good when you see what happens [Applause] and now that I\\'m your president you see it America is winning again and were respected again as a nation [Applause] [Music] and in a brand new report just came out as I\\'m walking on the stage hard to believe actually it turns out that Joe Biden was vice president he worked with the so called whistleblower this is nothing but a partisan witch hunt sabotage and I\\'m sure they\\'re going to say it\\'s totally unsubstantiated but one of them wrote the story congratulations by the way congratulate very nice that\\'s really good that\\'s the way you should do it good good good [Applause] in the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media it\\'s okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries flood our communities with drugs and crime and enrich themselves at America\\'s expense the treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game and it is far more rigged when Iran I thought it was rigged but this is crazy what\\'s happening but if you refuse to bow or bend to the Washington swamp which I could do very easily that\\'d be much more popular folks I\\'d be it would be so much easier you know a very smart I got it I gotta tell you isn\\'t it much better when I go off script isn\\'t that better so much [Applause] it\\'s just it\\'s us [Music] [Applause] hey folks the greatest buyer of advertisements in the history of the world Mike Linda Mike hello [Applause] I have never seen so many ants I think he\\'s the greatest ad negotiator in history and I told them I said would you do me a favor all the money we spend in these political campaigns if I gave some of that money to Mike I think would have ants every single minute of every single show anyway but the lawless political establishment will try to frame you they\\'ll persecute you they\\'ll swear and just swear up and down that they\\'re telling the truth when Nancy Pelosi was on television the other day I have to say I have to say I was very proud of George Stephanopoulos I was very proud it\\'s not often she said no no shifty shift old the truth when he said that Stephanopoulos hidden away red no no it wasn\\'t the truth it was a full set no no it was the truth he said no and then she really believes it so she\\'s either got one of two problems she\\'s either really stupid okay or she\\'s really lost it or maybe there\\'s a certain dishonesty in this up life but they spear you they spy on you and they target your friends your family your staff for harassment for abuse for destruction I came down to Washington with incredible people we want a great political campaign they were bright-eyed and bushy-tailed we know that\\'s a nice phrase they came down they were happy they wanted to turn the country around they wanted to do great things all of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by robert muller how good was he is a witness not to hold and by people that were I call him the 13 angry Democrats that turned into 18 angry Democrats it was disgraceful so people that were going down sir what is this I look oh wow that\\'s a subpoena what the hell is this they took people I really mean this they took people that were full of life and energy and vigor we just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics and they destroyed their lives they destroyed their lives they went home I could name many people one in particular who came down an incredible young woman she was going to help people she wanted to help people she had causes that was so good she wanted to help people and she ended up going home dark-dark her life became hell they ruined people they destroyed they destroyed people good people people that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made than they made they destroyed great people they\\'re vicious horrible and the media was behind every single step [Music] they destroyed so many lives they destroyed so many lives and they\\'re continuing to do it and it\\'s a disgrace when all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds these sinister fakers then try to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption there\\'s nothing like the dirty political establishment and I have to tell you that versus you no friend of mine very smart brilliant guy just with me about two weeks ago we just get rid of the Russia hoax and then a week later the the Ukraine hoax starts I had a week of like I can think about everything perfect it\\'s so beautiful and he said president I said call me Donald you\\'ve called me Donald for 35 years I will Thank You Donald I\\'ve lost all my friends because they\\'re all scared to talk you know like you know honestly I\\'m the president think they can\\'t talk to me anymore it\\'s like they\\'re afraid they respect the office it\\'s true they say president I say do me a favor Richard you\\'ve called me down for 35 years call me Donald please I want somebody to call me Donald [Applause] he said to me I just told him , he said president I can\\'t do it he said so is this president you\\'ve been here now for you think of it almost three years can you believe we\\'re here three years we we it\\'s we and we have to promise them no more than 16 years okay no more normal 16 more years I\\'m only kidding now they\\'ll go back see he wants to run from me but he said he said president could I ask you a question it\\'s so important to me you deal he\\'s a great businessman very successful he said you deal with all of these nations he\\'s great powerful who is the worst to deal with is it China is it North Korea is it India is it Russia please tell me mr. Pres who is the toughest nation to deal with I said you\\'re not gonna believe this it\\'s the USA is the toughest nation to deal with the USA it\\'s dirty because we\\'re dealing with some very sick and deranged people [Applause] there\\'s nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate own and control they\\'re trying to stop me because they know that I don\\'t answer to them I answer to you it\\'s true you know I never say this I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever said into the speech but maybe they\\'ll find out if I did then they\\'ll give me Pinocchio\\'s he said it before but I don\\'t know if I ever said this but you know I make as president about four hundred and fifty thousand dollars so I give it away [Applause] I never hear anything can you imagine if I didn\\'t I give it away too oh you can only give it you can\\'t keep it you can\\'t actually make a gift you can give it to your different agencies so I can give it to health I can give it to transportation I can give it to military but I give it away all the time every now and if I ever did but it\\'s for 50 if somebody stays from let\\'s say a Middle East country in one of my hotels and we charge him three hundred and ninety two dollars and fifty three cents for staying and I never heard of the guy and I don\\'t want to hear about him they say Trump is getting rich or four-nation I lose billions being President I don\\'t care it\\'s nice to be rich I guess but I lose billions if somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me too much in rent or hotel fees I never heard of the people they never know who they are they say he monuments nobody ever heard of the word Ivana bitch before in my immense it\\'s the craziest thing I\\'ve ever seen I tell you it\\'s cost me billions of dollars to be President it really has and at some point I\\'ll probably have to prove that and I look forward to - it\\'s very easy it\\'s very easy [Music] [Applause] and there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created [Applause] so in a desperate attempt to attack our movement Nancy and shop two beauties I\\'ve given control of the Democrat Party entirely over to the radical left including Minnesota\\'s own representative idiot Omar [Music] you know I know you people I know you people I know the people of Minnesota and I want to tell you and I also at the same time it\\'s both the question in his statement how the hell did that ever happen how did it happen how did it happen congresswoman Omar is an America hating socialists she minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland we\\'re far more than 3,000 people died saying some people did something big deal some people [Music] she pleaded for compassion for Isis recruits right here in Minnesota Omar left that Americans speak of al Qaeda remember that tape speak of al Qaeda but when we say but when we say something about the United States you just don\\'t say America with any intensity remember that representative Omar has a history of launching varial ins anti-semitic screens whether you like it or not she said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins she said that pro-israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country omar wrote that israel has hypnotized the world may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States how do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota I\\'m very angry at you people right now she is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that I\\'m going to win and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months [Applause] [Music] thank you very much so we\\'re honored to have with us today a special guest a man that really is a terrific talented writer he knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of Omar mister Scott Johnson of powerline he wrote some stuff I can\\'t believe it where\\'s Scott where\\'s Scott thank you Scott thank you Scott what a job man do you have her figured out the only problem is Scott it\\'s incredible talent much more talented than most of these people that you heard about the problem is they never pick it up they don\\'t want to pick it up but we pick it up Scott and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting thank you thank you very much [Applause] and Scott reported everything about Omar is a fraud including her name Scott reports his sources told him that quote Omar\\'s legal husband was Omar\\'s brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes you mean like coming into the United States maybe and as Scott says we have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like omar\\'s in Congress and nothing gets done about it I hope I hope that some of you people are looking because what a OC has gotten away with campaign financing and what I call it a OC plus 3 that\\'s what it is and Omar is one of the three what a OC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse and nothing happens to them but it happens to you and it\\'s not fair [Music] the fact is we\\'re in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America the only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd 2020 with your help we will win back to the house we will keep the Senate and we will win the White House and we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much one of your tremendous talented tough congressman Tom Emmer Tom also a man you don\\'t want to fight him and you don\\'t want to play him in hockey because he was tough he just won not that recently but pretty recently and I was out here campaigning for him and working hard and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him congressman Pete Stauber and a man who gets in the trenches and he just doesn\\'t care he wants to win for the people he loves you he loves this state he loves this country Jim Hagedorn and a great friend of mine with his incredible family he\\'s a friend he\\'s smart I guess you\\'d say he\\'s brilliant his education is incredible his military career has been incredible then he ran for office and now he\\'s a United States Senator from the great state of Arkansas Senator Tom cotton [Applause] great guy [Applause] and Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul gazelka thank you for Minnesota GOP chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan she\\'s been incredible I said Jennifer are we gonna win in 13 months she said honestly sir I\\'ve never seen anything like this it\\'s gonna be easy don\\'t ever say just assume we\\'re like 2 points behind ok 2 points behind you never ever please you do always just assume you\\'re a little behind but we\\'re gonna win this state by so much that people are going to be and plenty of other states you know we had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico and New Mexico is a hard state for Republicans has it been one in a long time also and we had receptivity that was unbelievable the audience was 40% Hispanic we\\'re we\\'re doing great and you know Hispanic they understand borders better than anybody better than we do they understand safety they understand their job they don\\'t want people taking it away they don\\'t want crime they understand it better that\\'s why we\\'re doing so well but we\\'re in New Mexico and I\\'m telling you that was electric but honestly all evenings are electric we have inherited bad ones a woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me a state that hadn\\'t been one in a long time by a Republican for whatever reason but it hadn\\'t been running I guess we didn\\'t have the right candidates right but a woman who would call me constantly I\\'d say I don\\'t want to talk to her she\\'s giving me a headache sir if you make one more trip you\\'re gonna win Michigan I say all right I make the trip I go back home I get a cold the next month sir we need one more this went over and over and over and we ended up winning the state of Michigan [Applause] and I said who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan it speak just one more time every week one more time sir and her name is rana mcdaniel she\\'s fantastic and she\\'s the head of the RNC she\\'s great and our campaign manager a man who\\'s really been green you know they used to say that crooked Hillary had a very very sophisticated campaign after she lost they said I guess it wasn\\'t sophisticated we had a sophisticated campaign nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy bred parse Cal remember when they used to say it you know I never got credit my father used to teach me if you can do it for less and win that\\'s good he wasn\\'t talking politics the last thing he\\'s looking down he\\'s definitely looking down not looking up he was great he was tough but he was great but my father my father would say if you could do it for less and win that\\'s a good thing not a bad thing if you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street and if it\\'s a nicer building and you can rent for less you\\'re really that\\'s like a good thing so in the campaign we spend much less money than crooked Hillary Clinton much and we won we won 306 a 223 that\\'s a pretty big remember remember they said electoral coach by the way when you run if you\\'re running the electoral college is like the hundred yard dash and the total vote you don\\'t go certain places you focus electoral college we have to explain to them it\\'s different so we won three or six and you remember they used to say once the hundred yard dash you practice once the mile you practice it\\'s a different race winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion the Electoral College I had to go to 22 different states for the total vote I go to like four states maximum much easier it\\'s about you see I\\'m all for it but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn\\'t go I love Maine I went to Maine four or five times I needed one point Maine gave me one point and what happened what happened I went there numerous times everyone said why because I was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that Trump Trump cannot get to 270 he cannot get they had me maximum if everything worked right at 269 so I kept going to Maine and you know what we won that one point in Maine but I kept going they say why I said well first of all it is really a beautiful place but we won the point but they said he cannot get to 270 I heard this for months and months I had such a headache almost as bad as listening to mics damn commercials about those pillows maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache does it cure headaches I think so but but here\\'s the thing here\\'s the thing so they said he cannot get to 270 in other words you can\\'t win you don\\'t get to 270 so if you can\\'t win right he can not do it there\\'s no way of doing it and they were right I got to 306 [Applause] but I didn\\'t get to 306 you got to 306 we won incredible says we want incredible states we won Wisconsin we won Michigan we want Pennsylvania we won North Carolina we want South Carolina we won Florida what a Runyan you remember the evening that we won I think look forgive me I think it was one of all of us together because we all worked hard I was the messenger but we all worked hard that was our victory not my victory but that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television and hopefully it\\'ll go down when we\\'re allowed to get all of this stuff seated you know it\\'s like a tree you plant it you plant it it has to go but it needs a little that\\'s why we need the four more additionally is it\\'s got a grab on it catch so they can\\'t destroy it so they can\\'t destroy it but I think it\\'ll go down and I hope it\\'s going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country because it\\'s never happened anything like that before and these guys don\\'t even question it they just sit back and say I guess he\\'s right about that I\\'ll never forget the night before I was at a tremendous arena the place was going crazy was like this going crazy and to reporters that hate my guts they looked at themselves they looked at each other a famous shot they\\'re looking like this and they\\'re saying what the hell is going on they knew they knew and I didn\\'t need Beyonce and jay-z and I didn\\'t need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these but they got all these people they\\'d come in because she couldn\\'t get a crowd that come in they\\'re saying they got Bruce Springsteen okay he\\'d do about do songs and leave what happens is they leave and then everyone leaves with him and she\\'s still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd its craziest craziest thing I\\'ve ever seen and then they complained sometimes I\\'ll use a terrible word like hell the other day I used the word hell I got it I got out from they said he used terrible language I used the word hell it was so bad but you gotta hear jay-z the words he was using he was using the f-word all over the place and then the next day they say I use bad language the word hell is a terrible word these people are sick but that was an amazing evening I\\'ll never forget that evening it\\'s you know look outside of your family and your children and things I love you too darling as one of the highest-rated evenings in the history of television you add up all those networks remember the woman crying oh my god now they worried biased at all now another very special man who\\'s with us today but he\\'ll never be a man to me he\\'ll always be my boy you know what I mean right he\\'s my boy he\\'s my little six foot six boy Eric trouble and the parents understand that right they may be big and strong and older and to a parent a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl and I know that\\'s probably politically incorrect they\\'ll say it was terrible what he said about women terrible but there are boy and there are girl and it doesn\\'t matter how old we get and how old they get is that a correct statement and I\\'m also proud to endorse your next Republican senator from Minnesota a man that I\\'ve known a man that is tough and smart a man that\\'s running against somebody that\\'s never done a damn thing in the Senate mr. Jason Lewis and Jason did a great job in Congress congressman Lewis thank you very much and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because I\\'ll tell you it\\'s going to be nasty it\\'s gonna be nasty they\\'re gonna make up stories about you they\\'re gonna say things that\\'s kind of want to make your wife say why did I marry this guy just say don\\'t worry about it it\\'s just another phony story thank you very much mr. mrs. Lewis Jason thank you and Jason they can\\'t say that about Tom cotton he\\'s too perfect this guy he can\\'t say they can\\'t say it about you Tom anyway good luck Jason do well and I don\\'t know why but with all of the great people I just introduced for tonight maybe this is the most important verse because I turned on a very good show in the morning Fox and Friends they treat us great I just want her what a great group Ainsley and Steve and by the way Brian\\'s gotten a lot better right Brian was a seven and he\\'s getting close to ten territory and Steve has been so great and Ainsley is just incredible and sometimes Pete hagseth gets on there for the week [Applause] and how good this Jesse Watters do how all right just some really great people and again Tucker\\'s been very good I have to say smart he\\'s been great Tucker and the legendary Sean Hannity great number one number one show Sean\\'s got the number one show and Laura Ingraham was knocking him out of the park [Music] [Applause] [Music] and you go over Maria Bartiromo and the great lou dobbs how good of a blue dot and many more i\\'m anymore how about greg greg is they may now he\\'s good oh we can\\'t forget we can\\'t forget judges Jeanine [Applause] I would be in such trouble if I forgot judges in it now these are grand there are many more I just you know look I\\'m just rattling some names up but they\\'re just terrific people the terrific people but a man that I have to really say something very special about so I\\'m watching Fox and Friends early in the morning very early in the six likes lot cuz I matter they\\'re pretty good and I see a handsome young man named Bob crawl cops for trouble and he\\'s talking about this lousy mare they\\'ve got now he didn\\'t quite say that but I\\'d say he\\'s talking about this lousy mayor that won\\'t let the cops the police the law enforcement you know my father always used to say son he meant it to never say cops it\\'s disrespectful say police officer I say okay pop but honestly the truth is with time I love you guys whether you\\'re cops police officers law enforcement I\\'ll call you whatever you want it doesn\\'t matter you are so great so respected you don\\'t even know how much our public loves you you don\\'t know it you don\\'t know when I see this guy and I don\\'t know if he\\'s done a lot of television before but he was very effective and very good and he was saying how the police aren\\'t being allowed to take care of this rally and yet with President Obama and Bush had all these people they were you know fine to fog everybody comes they fall asleep at a rally but they weren\\'t they weren\\'t allowed to do the job for us and they went wild so what I want to do [Music] go home to mommy [Music] mommy says I saw you on television tonight I love Trump don\\'t you ever do that again yes mom but the job he did before the election I came right here to Minnesota and I pledged to address this really important issue and it\\'s the issue of law enforcement and when I saw this man this great gentleman on television pouring out his guts pouring out his heart I don\\'t know him he knows I\\'ve been good to law enforcement he knows I\\'ve been good to as my father would say the police he knows I love the cops he knows that and so does everyone else I mean I had so many shirts so many red shirts and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts and I want to just tell you the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound it\\'s unbound come up here Bob come up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what can I say after that tune in Fox 10 15 tonight shannon bream they asked us on how could you thank this guy for everything he\\'s done for law enforcement wonderful president [Applause] thank you very much thank you great people thank you what a group [Applause] I think you\\'re very weak Khmer made a mistake when he took them on as you know for many years leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers I promise you that as president I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration control and I\\'ve done that since coming into office I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85% and as you know maybe especially in Minnesota I kept another promise I issued an executive action making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state so speak to you marry you should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods and that\\'s what you have the right to do right now and believe me no other president would be doing that if Democrats were ever to seize power they would open the floodgates to unvetted uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before you think you have it bad now you would never have seen anything like what they want to do but in the Trump administration we will always protect American families first and that has not been done in Minnesota [Applause] we\\'ve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place we are keeping terrorists criminals and extremists the hell out of our country and I want to thank the country of Mexico the President of Mexico has been incredible we have now 27,000 Mexican soldiers they\\'re great and they\\'re tough and they are now protecting our border and those numbers have gone down like this Thank You mr. president we will not make the mistakes made in European countries that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country on our shores we\\'re not going to allow it to happen [Applause] and as you all know to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us I instituted a very controversial very hard to get travel ban on some of the world\\'s most dangerous countries [Applause] and the other day one of the fake news reporters in the back said they were talking about the travel ban and they said well you know the president has lost in court they said we\\'re on the travel ban and he\\'s right I lost and then I lost at the Appellate Division and then I won at the United States of Prayer [Applause] right and he knew that but he said I lost on that and he was right I lost and then I lost again but then I won and we have the travel ban but instead of saying he lost and then he lost at the appellate and then he wanted the United States Supreme Court he said he lost on the travel ban these are very dishonest people do you understand that very [Music] in the Republican Party we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values honor our history and love our people Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities and we\\'re not letting it happen anymore Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans not for criminal aliens my administration is taking historic action to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60 percent since May and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built and this is a serious wall you\\'ve all seen it it\\'s going up rapidly and you think that was easy I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me fighting me fighting me I had a lot of the Rhinos fighting me they say she\\'s not getting it bill he\\'s not get let me tell you you have every Democrat fighting you we took it from here and we took it from there or we took it from all over the place and we got that thing that\\'s the biggest patchwork of financing you\\'ve ever seen and that sucker is going up and it is the finest it is the strongest it\\'s largely 30 feet tall which is the maximum height that they wanted I went to the Border Patrol and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol and I said what do you want what\\'s your ideal I actually said I want to give you the rolls-royce and they killed me for that they said it\\'s not an american-made product did they happen to be right no they\\'re right about that one they\\'re actually right there Tom but I said I want to give you the rolls-royce of walls tell me and they told me everything and then we built some alternative walls we built all different types we built about seven of them and then we had climbers come in the one that worked the best was the one we\\'re building it also unfortunately the bad news it\\'s also the most expensive but we got it for the right price it\\'s still it\\'s hardened concrete it\\'s deep it\\'s high to thing of beauty and it\\'s going to keep bad people out of our country that\\'s what it\\'s going to do and the Democrats knew this most of the Democrats four years ago they wanted a wall now all of a sudden they don\\'t want a wall you know why that I want a wall because I wanted television and I just thought of it you know like a year ago I said man this could have been so much easier all I had to do is say we don\\'t want a wall and they would have given me all the finance and I wanted for the wall what what was I thinking we\\'re not gonna build a wall and they would have forced me to build and I would have under this administration we are also ending the endless wars we have to do it folks we have to go we have totally defeated the Isis Caliphate and I did that in rather quick time if you remember because we have the greatest fighting machine now when I came in it was totally depleted we have great generals we have great war fighters and they did it so fast I flew to Iraq I met with the generals right I met with the generals I said I hear it\\'s going to take a year to two years sir we could do it in two weeks I said what they don\\'t let us fight sir they don\\'t let us fight we want to fight they don\\'t let us fight I said I let you fight I said how come if they say it\\'s going to take anywhere from a year to two years you say you can do it so quickly he said sir we\\'re gonna hit him from the front we could hit him from the back we\\'re gonna hit him from the sides from underground from overgrow we\\'re gonna hit the hell out of him and they did and we won very quickly but from now on we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the United States of America not to the benefit of other countries and we will only fight to win we\\'re only going to fight to win we don\\'t fight to win we don\\'t fight to win the Turks have been fighting with the Kurds for two centuries and Turkey as you know is a NATO ally but I\\'ve been rough on them we\\'ve defeated 100% of that Isis Caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area we don\\'t have any troops the troops have been pulled out where turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against their courage get them out [Applause] so Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds we get along with the Kurds and we help the Kurds and don\\'t forget they\\'re also fighting for their land you know that but they\\'re fighting so we have three choices you\\'re ready here\\'s the three choices we don\\'t have any soldiers there because we\\'ve left we won we left take a victory United States we laugh take a victory take a victory bring our troops back home I told the story yesterday I have to sign letters it\\'s the hardest thing I have to do I sign letters dear mr. and mrs. Smith from Arkansas dear mr. and mrs. Jones from Alabama dear mr. mrs. somebody from some great state I\\'m sorry to inform you your son has been killed in combat I\\'m so sorry and every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents they\\'re grieving and they get together with other parents and they get and I don\\'t want to see that it\\'s like the same letter so we do different letters it\\'s the hardest thing I have to do hardest thing it\\'s the hardest thing I have I was telling Tom cotton it\\'s the hardest thing that I have to do and I signed those letters and it just it breaks your heart and then and by the way there\\'s a time to fight nobody fights harder than I do but there\\'s a time and it\\'s not necessarily a time but I send these letters out quite a few and sometimes I send letters out it\\'s called blue and green where we\\'re teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun and our soldiers and shoot them in the back and that\\'s the hardest thing for a parent I have all of them I know everyone that\\'s the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification because they learn how their child has died when the so called people that were teaching how to fight turned the gun on them and she we\\'ve had a lot of that a lot of it in Afghanistan more than we\\'ve ever had proportionately before it\\'s a horrible horrible thing but I have to sign these letters and sometimes I go out to a place Dover Air Force Base it\\'s a very tough experience mike pence goes I go other people go Tom cotton goes we go out there and we meet the parents and the families the wives the children the sisters the brothers we meet them and we talked to them and their son or daughter is being flown in from some faraway place in a coffin and these things are just impossible I don\\'t know how parents can do it even and I\\'ll meet them and we have a particular kernel that\\'s all he does so good so professional and that\\'s what he does he said I greet the dead sir I greet the dead and what happens is this big incredible machine flies in this tremendous cargo plane and it flies in so powerful so big and I\\'ll be talking to some of the parents and they\\'ll act like they\\'re fine I said how you did we\\'re fine sir we\\'re fine we\\'re really good I say that\\'s great and I\\'ll tell the colonel and say Colonel I think they\\'re doing great no sir they\\'re not gonna do great you\\'ll see and I didn\\'t know what he was talking about this is the first time and then we went outside to the runway and this incredible machine is flying in and it lands and it comes over and it pulls up and we have military guards we have incredible talented musicians that do this that\\'s what they do and what happens is that door opens up and the colonel told me he said sir when that door opens up those same people that you think are okay do things that you\\'ll never see you will hear sounds like you\\'ve never heard that\\'s what he does and I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it the door is open and these beautiful soldiers five or six on each side lifting the coffin and walking down the runway the plank they call it off this cargo plane and I see parents make sounds that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine make sounds scream and cry like you\\'ve never seen before the colonel was telling me that sir you\\'ll see things that you\\'ve never seen before a mother who was fine 20 minutes ago you think breaking the military line and jumping off and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter jumping on on top of the flowers on top of the American flag I\\'ve seen this and then I have all these people that want to stay they want to stay and I don\\'t want to stay we were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days we\\'ve now been there for 10 years we were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time we\\'re now going to be there for close to 19 years it\\'s time to bring them home it\\'s time to go [Applause] time to bring him home we\\'ve done our job we\\'ve defeated everyone that we\\'re supposed to defeat and now we are we are policing we are now policing that\\'s what we\\'re doing we\\'re policing and that as I said no more respect for the police but these are military people and those are police but we are now police say we\\'re not fighting we\\'re policing and you know what after all of these years and and one other story and I have to tell you I go to Walter Reed on Friday and I do it quite often I gave out five Purple Hearts and I meet people that are so beautiful so amazing I met five warriors and one was so badly hurt with the loss of arms and a lake another one they\\'re just very very devastated but these are great great people and I gave out the Purple Heart they see the parents and I have to say Walter Reed I want to just say the doctors they\\'re the job they do you know you\\'ll hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets and the vets care and nobody\\'s done better we got choice for the vets we did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible but I saw these young men and I gave them their purple hearts and their parents were there crying and one of them was so amazing I said what\\'s your problem sir my face was blown apart my nose was absolutely just blown apart he said sir it\\'s incredible and I looked at him I said that\\'s the most beautiful nose I\\'ve ever seen what do you mean he said a doctor worked on my face for ten hours in the field he said there were a thousand fragrance now I don\\'t know if that\\'s right but well a lot he meant a lot he said there were a thousand fragments he rebuilt my nose with glue he glued the bones together he rebuilt my nose I say you have the most beautiful nose I\\'ve ever seen and it\\'s true and his father came over to me he said sir father was crying he said sir honestly my son looks better now he said my son did not have a good looking nose now look at it it\\'s beautiful it\\'s beautiful but these doctors at Walter Reed in these army and marine and the medical doctors they are unbelievably great people and they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see they see things that nobody will ever see and there\\'s nobody like them and I have to give a shout out to those people there\\'s nobody [Applause] so in the case of Turkey and Syria and the Kurds we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey now you don\\'t want to do that we could hit Turkey very hard financially or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds I like that you know let\\'s mediate a deal but remember they\\'ve been fighting each other for hundreds of years and we were artificially put there in this case by President Obama so we did our job we knocked out and I\\'ll tell you another thing we have to be treated fairly we have to be treated fairly we\\'re not treated fairly by other nations we captured many many Isis fighters most of them came from Europe they came from Germany they came from France that came from all of these countries and we called them I called them myself in many cases I said take your fighters they said we don\\'t want them you take them I said no no no we did you a big favor they\\'re citizens of Germany they\\'re citizens of France there\\'s citizens of these various countries in Europe take your fighters we don\\'t want them sir we don\\'t want them and I said how unfair will we treat it we do them a great favor and they won\\'t take the fighters so we\\'re doing some things that are pretty amazing and every once in a while you have to change course and do what you have to do the United States has spent eight trillion dollars in the Middle East we\\'ve lost thousands of brave soldiers and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people great people their lives will never be the same these wars produce only chaos and bloodshed and all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed made the Middle East left it\\'s really it\\'s less safe it\\'s less stable and it\\'s less secure and I say it all the time the single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East we spent eight trillion dollars and lost thousands of lives and by the way the other side we can talk about that lost millions of lives what did we do so we\\'re gonna pull them out and with pulling people out of we\\'re trying to make good deals and we\\'re gonna bring our soldiers back home and we may need them for something else and they\\'ll be ready previous administrations lust for regime change and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started they are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless Farr adventures the Christians the Christians and we work hard with the Christians we have tremendous evangelical support we work hard live again so we\\'re slowly getting out of the Middle East for doing it carefully and we\\'re rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before when I came into office a very prominent general told me because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone said sir we have no ammunition we had old planes we had planes that were so old they didn\\'t fly we had people going to the desert the plane graveyards airplane graveyards picking up parts I never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again I never want to have a president hear the words sir we have no ammunition think of that think of that now thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military we have more ammunition more missiles more rockets more tanks more fighter jets and more of everything else than we\\'ve ever had [Music] [Applause] and we have no choice you look around the world and we have no choice unfortunately and the Democrats want to dismantle our military after years of building up other countries we are finally building up our country that\\'s what we have to do we\\'re replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand-new US Mexico Canada agreement u.s. MCA a giant victory for our farmers ranchers workers in Minnesota Congress should pass us MCA immediately we hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense and to protect your industrial back I place tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel and I\\'m also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China and the supply chain of China which was unbreakable is now breaking wide open and they understand that and I don\\'t blame China for what\\'s taking place over the last 25 years I blame the people that led our country that let that happen where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China not China\\'s fault in the previous administration they put our nation\\'s natural resources under lock and key including thousands and thousands of acres at a place called Superior National Forest last year I travel to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice reopening Superior National Forest and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota tremendous job and now the Iron Range is back in business [Applause] and the last time I was here a man came up to me said sir President Obama took our heart away took our life away I\\'ll never forget it a man strong guy had tears in his eyes he said you gave us back our life because they took it away from we gave it back best iron ore there is anyway my administration is also fighting the Democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare Republicans will protect Medicare and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and for those of you that have private health care health insurance 180 million people they are going to end it obliterate it and most people are thrilled with it we are going to leave it you\\'re gonna have your plan the way you want it and there\\'s no plan like this virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up to the moment up and that is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extremely term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God [Applause] Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant Washington corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and it\\'s the party of the American dream for years you watched as your politicians apologized for America you remember that tea I\\'m sorry I\\'m so sorry now you have a president who\\'s standing up for America we are standing up for Minneapolis and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota [Applause] we begin this political campaign with the best record the best results the press agenda and the only positive vision for America we begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country together we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity with your help we will relax and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration we will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years nobody thought that could be done gonna be done we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms [Applause] and above all we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and always respect our great American flag and we live by the words of our great national motto In God We Trust [Applause] we stand on the shoulders of American patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history our ancestors crossed the oceans settled the continent tamed the wilderness revolutionized industry pioneered science won two World Wars defeated fascism and communism and put a man on the face of the moon proud citizens like the people of Minnesota helped build this country and together we are taking back our country we are returning power to you the American people with your help your devotion your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning winning [Applause] [Music] we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under God America is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen of Minnesota I will tell you this with great certainty the best is yet to come [Applause] thank you very much and just in concluding together we will make America wealthy again we will make America strong again we will make America safe again and we will make America great again Thank You Minnesota thank you [Applause] you you good evening and thanks so much for watching president Trump\\'s most energetic I would have to say rally after seeing the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you very much hello Dallas it\\'s great to be with you tonight thank you and I am thrilled to be here deep in the heart of Texas where we just opened a beautiful new louis vuitton plant when I\\'m with the freedom-loving Patriots of the Lone Star State I love there has never been a better time to be a proud Texan and there\\'s never a better better time to be a proud American that never has so I came from a small town Alvarado Texas where we celebrated the incredible revival of American manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places I\\'ll tell you this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time an extra 1,000 jobs for Texas since my election we\\'ve created 775 thousand new jobs of course you state including 70,000 Texas manufacturing jobs they said those jobs had disappeared didn\\'t they man our country is once again living by two simple rules by American and higher American the economy is booming our people are prospering our country is thriving and our nation is stronger than ever before but the more America jeeves the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become crazy they\\'re crazy they are crazy at stake in this fight is their survival of American democracy itself don\\'t kid yourself that\\'s what they want they are destroying this country but we will never let it happen not even twice for three straight years radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great great election maybe maybe the greatest election in the history of our country and they want to impose an extreme agenda they cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box they\\'re not going to win they\\'re not even they won\\'t come close in 2020 they know it they know they\\'re not gonna win it they say let\\'s see what\\'s another idea what\\'s another idea how do we win this election you know I really don\\'t believe anymore that they love our country I don\\'t believe [Applause] crazy Nancy thank you that crazy Nancy she is crazy [Applause] and shifty chef how about this guy how about this he makes up my conversation which was perfect he makes up my conversation he sees what I said it doesn\\'t play well because it was perfect so he made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian president [Applause] and we caught him cold everybody knew it anyway see we did one thing you always have to do the unexpected they never thought I\\'d release the conversation with the Ukrainian president I want to get him before Congress and I want to see what he has to say you know they say he has immunity why would you have immunity for outright fraud why do you have immunity why he\\'s a fraud we\\'re fighting a campaign against leftist socialist and globalist who want to return to reckless wars open borders rampant crime and totally disastrous one-way trade deals with changing that went around very quickly they believe America is the world\\'s piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own it\\'s not happening our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens and you know that\\'s what\\'s been happening and that\\'s why 2016 was so important and that\\'s why 2020 I can never say it\\'s more important but you know it\\'s like the roots of a tree you plant the baby tree it\\'s got a catch get that extra time we\\'ll have more tax cuts we\\'ll have even I\\'ll tell you what we have rebuilt our military what we\\'ve done has never been done before the do-nothing Democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over we are finally again and we\\'ve been doing it now for almost three years can you believe we\\'ve been doing this I\\'ve been a politician for three years I can\\'t believe that I never thought I\\'d be called the politician I don\\'t like it but it is what it is but we\\'re finally again putting America first the Radical Democrats want to destroy America\\'s we know it they want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that America is a sinful wicked nation you see that happening all the time and I know it from personal experience what they want to teach your kids not good they come home mommy daddy this is what I learned and you\\'re going oh no don\\'t tell me let\\'s get them into another school fast they want to disarm law-abiding citizens they want to take your guns away and they want to install far-left judges to shred our constitution is not happening they want to tear down symbols of faith and drive Christians and religious believers from the public square they want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor muzzle and shut down conservative voices you know that if they didn\\'t hate our country they wouldn\\'t be doing this to our country they wouldn\\'t be doing it because they know better they know better as an example we\\'re building a great wall along the southern border and it\\'s going up rapidly going up and you know five years ago almost every one of them wanted a wall until I came along and I said we\\'re gonna build a great wall cuz they could never get it done and then they stopped the funding they made it almost impossible few people would have been able to do what we did but we got it from here and we got it from there and we got it from all over the place and we\\'re building that sucker right now and it\\'s having a tremendous effect already not easy highest level everything we said it would be it\\'s moving rapidly although the fake news back there they don\\'t want to talk about [Applause] they don\\'t want to talk about look at all those cameras you believe it look at all those red lights don\\'t worry I won\\'t say anything bad about your network because a lot of times I get ready to do a number of these phony networks and you know you see those red lights go wall fall fall fall they don\\'t want their viewers to see it but that\\'s okay I\\'m not gonna say it tonight I\\'m going to say your legitimate media I don\\'t actually be there but you look at that but look at all those covers you know that\\'s like the Academy Awards used to be be caught before it fell you know why it failed you know why it failed because they came after us that\\'s why it fell it failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us stupid stupid people they are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket I love seeing it I\\'m telling you but no matter how hard they try they will fail because the people of Texas and the people of America will never surrender our freedom to those people right there we will stand strong for family faith God and for country last week a very dumb Democrat candidate for president that\\'s the end of him in this state pledged to revoke the tax-exempt status of many churches and religious charities and by the way that was after a few weeks ago he said excuse me we\\'re going to take your guns away that doesn\\'t work well and I called him right remember the flailing arms nobody noticed it I noticed it the flail er you remember he was flailing all over the place I said why is this guy hot john cornyn is going to win so easily just like ted cruz one who\\'s gonna win no matter what happens but john cornyn is not talking about bado anymore because Vado in a few short weeks got rid of guns and got rid of religion those are not two good things in Texas to get rid of and I will never allow the federal government to be used to punish Americans for their religious beliefs and I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon except in the case of myself where they use it against me the radical left tolerates no dissent it permits no opposition it accepts no compromise these people are crazy and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American people first it was the Russia hoax then it was this smeary which continues that disgraceful disgusting smearing of a fine man justice Cavanaugh [Applause] and now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch-hunt with nothing with nothing they come after me but what they\\'re really doing is they\\'re coming after the Republican Party and what they\\'re really really doing is they\\'re coming after and fighting you and we never lose I\\'m fighting for everyone who believes in the values traditions and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world and I have to say this we are far greater now than ever before you go back for years you go back seven six eight even you go back into another administration you go back ten and twelve years where were you compared to where you are right now so we must hold the Democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption they are corrupt people and we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up it\\'s going to be a landslide and we have to make it advance today\\'s do nothing Democrats they don\\'t do anything where\\'s the us MCA everybody wants it the Democrats even wanted and crazy Nancy won\\'t let anybody vote on it she\\'s nuts today\\'s Democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed it\\'s not just like let\\'s win you know I have to say this the Republicans said I\\'m not sure I like this because my life hasn\\'t been this way but the Republicans play a much softer game they really do when all of our stars that we have great stars when they went to our Speaker of the House at the time and they asked for subpoenas oh let\\'s take it easy let\\'s do okay I mean I get that too she hands them out like it\\'s cookies here sip it I heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day doesn\\'t like us at all but but said I\\'ve never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas I have people getting subpoenas I never heard of my said were those people never saw anything like it it\\'s a disgrace what they\\'re doing to our country and we became because of what they do not the Republicans and not what we\\'ve done because what they\\'ve done and what they see when people come to my office which is now the Oval Office which is your office too presidents prime ministers kings queens I hate to say it sometimes dictators they just don\\'t like to go by that title they say sir congratulations sir and what you\\'ve done congratulations on what you\\'ve done it\\'s incredible your economy is the greatest on earth and let me tell you if my crooked opponent would have won the election right now China would be by far the number one nation from an economic standpoint in the world we\\'ve gone up trillions of dollars they\\'ve gone down trillions of dollars and we are so far number one so far that they\\'ll never catch us if we are smart right here but the do-nothing Democrats believe anyone who opposes them has to be crushed they don\\'t one just beat them they don\\'t want to just beat them these are sick people they want to crush these people the anger the hatred and that any lie or crime or corruption is justified so shift gets up and makes up my statement he makes it up a hundred percent and then he said he didn\\'t speak to the whistleblower no we didn\\'t see the whistleblower and what about the whistleblower the whistleblower got it all wrong who\\'s the whistleblower who\\'s the whistleblower who is the whistleblower we have to know is the whistleblower is spy and who is the IG that did this all he had to do is look at the tape or look at the what they wrote down the transcribed version of the phone call compare that to the whistleblowers account and you see it had nothing to do with it so why does the IG allow a thing like this to happen to our country why why get a lot of bad people out there but one by one we\\'re advancing one by one just look at the terrible foreign corruption of the Biden\\'s I hate to talk about him you know why I don\\'t think the guys got a chance sleepy Joe I don\\'t think he\\'s got it I don\\'t see it I don\\'t know I\\'ve got these great brilliant senators over here I have all these congressmen over here fellas I don\\'t think he has a chance I\\'d like him to I\\'d like him to you know I thought Pocahontas was gone left in embers you got to give her credit those embers they kept going going going now it looks like she\\'s doing better but I don\\'t think Joe has a chance but did you see the other night where CNN in a totally unsubstantiated statement the president said this about you who is so sorry he said that he said walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China these were not the same Chinese people I just dealt with I will tell you that but Joe Biden was in charge of Ukraine policy while his son with absolutely no energy experience just got thrown out of the Navy like a dog was paid massive sums of money by a Ukrainian energy company you know that\\'s called it\\'s called a pay off folks he didn\\'t know energy at all do nothing about energy they hired him paying him massive amounts of money much more than the 50,000 a month you heard about that\\'s a lot that\\'s a lot but much more Joe Biden made them go out and fire the prosecutor on tape but they don\\'t want to show the tape I had to put it up on a social media site they don\\'t want to show the tape where he was bragging they\\'re not going to get this money unless they get rid and boo they got rid of the prosecutor he was investigating the son and the sons company get rid of them now that\\'s what you call quid pro quo while these charges are totally unsubstantiated these are the fake news errs out there and then Biden flew think of it he goes into a tough place we just made such a great deal with China I think just think of this my guy said if we could get 20 billion in agricultural product that would be good the most China ever did was 16 billion for our farmers okay we\\'re just talking about the farmers we did banking we did everything but we\\'re talking about them the most they ever did was 20 billion of product from our farmers or great farmers or patriot farmers or farmers that never left us even though they were being targeted by China they never left me so they wanted 20 and China agreed and I said nope no good I want 50 billion not 20 billion 50 so my guys say sir we have a problem sir our farmers cannot produce that much it\\'s true I said tell them to go out and get bigger tractors right john deere case caterpillar all american only american tractors we only buy american to go out he get bigger so now china\\'s agree to they\\'ve already started buying hopefully the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with President Xi and others in Chile so that\\'s in about four weeks but think of this they said sir they can\\'t produce fifty billion dollars I said I want the farmers to tell me remember the story about winning we\\'re gonna win so much we\\'re going to the White House we\\'re gonna tell the president sir we just can\\'t stand winning the state of Texas John Cornyn and Ted Cruz they\\'re gonna come into my office sir we just just can\\'t stand this winning in Texas anymore it\\'s too much we can\\'t handle it well that\\'s what I want from the farmers I want the farmers to say I want the farmers to say sir we just can\\'t produce that much product we can\\'t do it sir and I\\'m gonna say yes you can and they\\'re gonna say no we can\\'t I\\'m gonna say yes you can and they\\'re gonna go out and they\\'re gonna take in 50 billion from China as opposed to 20 that\\'s what\\'s gonna happen that\\'s what\\'s gonna happen but they were great they stuck with us through thick and thin now it\\'s really working out for a lot of different groups and in the meantime we\\'ve taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and China\\'s eat and of course because they devalued their currency and they put money out tens of billions of dollars it\\'s cost us nothing billions and billions and billions and you know what I did for the farmer during the lean times I gave them 16 billion last year and 12 billion the year before 28 billion dollars all together came out of the tariffs that I had a lot of money left over and nobody complained and you know our farmers didn\\'t want that money our farmers didn\\'t want a true story everybody comes from money countries come for everybody wants money right they all want our money the farmers said sir we don\\'t want this money to subsidy we don\\'t want it I said no it\\'s not a substitute it unfairly they said no search the subsidy this is true I had 35 farmers in the Oval Office incredible people they didn\\'t want it they said sir just give us a level playing field so now I gave them a field that\\'s more than level it\\'s level like this nice and easy nice and easy but the farmers I call him the great Patriots the farmers they I never lost them they always said you know yeah I\\'m in trouble I got a problem but this should have been done many many years ago by other precedents and other leaders and we lose for many years 500 billion dollars a year with China and many other countries who lose billions Willa\\'s with everybody but that\\'s all changing now but we lose 500 billion not million 500 millions a lot right we lose 500 billion and you know what it\\'s a disgrace that that was allowed to go on for 25 years it was a disgrace disgrace but now we\\'re taking in billions of dollars they\\'ve had the worst year they\\'ve had in 27 years and we\\'re having the best year we\\'ve ever had so that\\'s so Biden flew with Hunter on Air Force two they flew to China hunter walked out of the plane at a quick meeting walked away with one and a half billion dollars and these characters back there said oh that\\'s okay there\\'s no problem can you imagine if Don or Eric trump or Ivanka Trump who\\'s here someplace right here and by the way our great first lady is home watching this she said this is the most exciting thing I\\'ve seen in a long time she\\'s a great first lady doing a great job she\\'s doing a great job we\\'re doing a great job the whole country now is doing a great job so Biden takes a billion five and he goes on and allows China to rip us off remember he said a year ago we know China\\'s good they\\'ve done nothing wrong they\\'re wonderful people they are wonderful people I don\\'t blame China by the way I blame our leaders for allowing this horrible unit Watt and pillage it\\'s the r-word you know what and pillage you know what word I\\'m talking about right I don\\'t want to use it because they\\'ll say it\\'s a horrible word that Trump use so the Biden\\'s got rich while America got robbed tonight we forcefully condemned the blatant corruption of the Democrat Party and nobody ever pays the price with the Democrats is so deep-seated they never paid the price they never paid but maybe soon that will start you know we\\'ve had a lot of we\\'ve had a lot of Obama people and Clinton people and some to be honest with you we\\'ve had some pretty bad Republicans down deep that didn\\'t exactly love us but slowly they\\'re getting out they have all sorts of protections but so he says get rid of them yeah we\\'re trying get rid of them but they\\'re partnering the whole thing is to fake news media that\\'s the problem [Applause] because the Democrats and the fake news media it\\'s a partnership remember that and you see it all the time and I\\'ve never seen it to this extent you know when I won in the primaries and then I won the election I was treated horribly by the media horribly and then when I won the election we had the greatest night one of the highest-rated nights in the history of television all over the world and I won and I said oh the great thing I said to Ivanka I said to the first lady I said to anybody that would listen I said listen this is so great finally finally we all of us were going to be respected by the media and you know what happened they got worse that worse now than they ever have been they\\'re crooked as hell they\\'re worse now than they\\'ve ever been they\\'re crooked [Applause] the only message these radicals and they are radical lefties will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd 2020 save that with your help we will win back the house we will keep the Senate and we will keep the White House in numbers like they haven\\'t seen in a long long time joining us tonight are many terrific Republican leaders and they are terrific and frankly if they\\'re not I\\'m not gonna introduce I\\'m okay but we have some great leaders and you have great leaders in Texas

thing not a bad thing right my father said if you can spend less so we spent much less than Hillary crooked Hillary crooked where are those emails Hillary they may find those 33,000 emails they\\'re

have done thank you a lot of job he\\'s done he was also a great governor of Texas that you know in everything we do we\\'re fighting for the faithful citizens of this country this includes putting a stop to the catastrophic era of endless wars endless wars they don\\'t stop they don\\'t stop they go on forever we become policemen we end up becoming police we\\'re policing these countries that\\'s not what it\\'s about we\\'ve spent eight trillion dollars in the Middle East thousands of American soldiers have lost their lives tens of thousands more have been severely wounded and in all fairness the other side has lost millions of people millions millions of people think of it these wars brought mass chaos instability destruction and death today we choose a different path we had tremendous success today I don\\'t know if you\\'ve seen look we built in the last three years we built the strongest military by far when I and I told the story I was embarrassed to tell it but now I\\'ll tell when I first got in a general told me we could have had a conflict with someone said sir we don\\'t have ammunition and I said I never want to hear a president I just never want to hear somebody have that statement made to them again as president of the United States we don\\'t have ammunition think of how bad now we have so much ammunition we don\\'t know what to do with it and as you all know I guess you\\'ve been watching today I sent vice-president pence and Secretary of State Pompeo to lead an American delegation to meet with President Erdogan of Turkey they got there today and it did work without spilling a drop of American blood not one drop of American blood we\\'ve all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of Syria and it was unconventional what I did I said they\\'re gonna have to fight a little while sometimes you have to let him fight a little while then people find out how tough the fighting is these guys know right up here these guys go right sometimes you have to let him fight it\\'s like two kids it a lot you gotta let him fight and then you pull him apart but it was unconventional but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious and the Kurds who are friends and took he\\'s our friend but they fought it was tougher I mean it was nasty and you couldn\\'t make a deal for 15 think of it for 15 years 20 years they couldn\\'t make a deal the Kurds didn\\'t want to move turkey didn\\'t want to budge and Turkey was having a lot of bad things happen from this region and all fairness to Turkey they were having a lot of bad but they didn\\'t want now all of a sudden they fight then it\\'s not fun having bullets going all over the place and we went there and we said we want to pause and the Kurds have been terrific they\\'re going to move back a little bit we\\'re going to keep Isis all nice and locked up okay we\\'re gonna find more and turkeys all set and President Erdogan was great and we\\'re going to take the worst sanctions and tariffs and everything that I put on the country we put the worst the war I mean I don\\'t think they could have economically survived but that doesn\\'t matter president Erdogan was a gentleman he understood it but without a little tough love you know what tough love is right without a little tough love they would have never made this deal President Obama lost a million people in the area a million people a million people so now we\\'re doing during a five-day period we\\'re gonna see if we can get it all finalized and I think it will be I think it will be so turkeys going to be happy the Kurds are going to be happy Isis is going to be unhappy we\\'ll deal with whoever we have to deal with but we\\'ll get it done and it\\'s a great tribute to a lot of very talented people and thank you to vice president pence and thank you to Mike Pompeo good job good job and they\\'re traveling back to our country by night traveling back and they\\'ll be back soon and we\\'ll have a big conference on it but it was a terrific thing and we\\'ve taken care of a lot of religious persecution we ended that in a lot of things are in that agreement that nobody ever thought possible so we have to fundamentally change our approach to homeland security as an example in that example nobody would have ever done that you have to be a little bit different to do it that way I took a lot of heat even from some of our congressmen even from some of our senators but now they\\'re all happy and I\\'m happy with them I\\'m happy with them [Music] now I don\\'t know what about the Democrats the Democrats will say oh what a terrible anything we do the Democrats were criticized if I said like on the China deal we get Beijing for $1 they would say what a terrible deal it just doesn\\'t work with them you know the wall we spent so much time with them on the wall and I realized about two weeks ago all I had to do was say we will never build the wall and they would have come through and they said we demand that you build it it would have been so much easier right would have been so much easier Ted would have been so much ease American combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflicts all over the world bring our soldiers back home bring our soldiers back home the same people pushing us to fight endless wars overseas want us to open up orders to mass migration from these war-torn and Terra afflicted regions their policies would import terrorism right onto our shores with American issued visas oh isn\\'t that wonderful and by the way the Democrats want open borders they want everybody to flow in they want those caravans to flow in the caravan and they wouldn\\'t get rid of the loopholes but you know what Mexico has been great Mexico today had 27,000 soldiers on our border and we stopped this horrible migration of people and many of them are bad people you know when countries send them up they\\'re not sending their finest okay use your heads they\\'re not sending their finest you got to see some of the people but now we send them back and by the way Isis fantastic they\\'ve taken out thousands and thousands of ms-13 killers they\\'ve taken thousands of killers and and now we\\'ve made deals with Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador and Mexico but we\\'ve made deals now where we can bring back there are 45,000 people waiting in Mexico but it\\'s going to be very tough for these people ever to get back when did you ever hear that used to have no people waiting in Mexico they just let our borders are getting strong when the wall is complete they\\'ll be as strong as any borders anywhere in the world my administration believes in a simple principle the best way to keep foreign terrorists out of America is to deny them just deny them admission in the first place it\\'s really pretty simple and that is why I\\'ve imposed and we had passed and we won at the United States Supreme Court a travel ban on some of the world\\'s most dangerous countries and place but if Democrats seize power they would throw the floodgates wide open wide open we would have people coming into our country look at what\\'s going on in California in the people of California don\\'t want it they say come into California we\\'ll give you free health care free edge account why wouldn\\'t I may even move to California if they they keep going now but all it does is it brings everybody in what\\'s wrong with these people we\\'re rebuilding our military stronger than ever before and we are not going to deplete it again on stupid senseless endless wars we\\'ve invested more than two and a half trillion dollars restoring our armed forces and all of it was built in the USA and that includes approving the construction of almost 200 f-35 fighters stealth stealth and many of them are built right here right here you know that right in Fort Worth as we restore our security we\\'re also restoring our prosperity America is winning again and America is respected again and by the way I have to say this so outside they have close to thirty thousand people and I wonder if I could ask the fire marshal fill up this little area let them in to be sergeants you know they have a certain max we broke the record tonight good place last month unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years seven million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election what a great 1.3 million children have been lifted out of poverty think of that and African American Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history our great Hispanic American population has reached a poverty level which is a all-time low in US history and after years of stagnation wages for Hispanic Americans are rising fast up nearly 8 percent since my election and everybody in the fake news would have said that\\'s absolutely impossible [Applause] medium income think of this median income for Hispanic Americans to surpass $50,000 a year for the first time ever with Republicans in Congress we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reform by far in American history by the way the Democrats want to raise your taxes you know I don\\'t mean a little bit I don\\'t mean a little bit I mean like double them up triple them up and it still won\\'t pay for the nonsense they were we eliminated a record number of regulations and we ended the war on a thing called American energy which is very good for Texas since my election natural gas production in Texas has increased 35% and oil production has increased by 60 percent six own and the United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world yet every major Democrat running for president wants to abolish all production of oil and natural gas I think they want to go to windmills windmills you know darling I want to watch Trump speak to that we can\\'t darling the wind isn\\'t blowing they won\\'t win though in other words they want to annihilate your Texas economy can you imagine no more oil no more natural so here we have a few people right no guns no religion no oil no natural gas Abraham Lincoln could not win Texas under those circumstances we can do it Louie Abraham Lincoln Honest Abe couldn\\'t do it Louis remember I used to say I can be more presidential look emotes that I can be more presidential than any president in history except for Honest Abe Lincoln when he\\'s wearing the Hat that\\'s that\\'s tough that\\'s a tough one to be no it\\'s much easier being presidential is easy all you have to do is act like a stiff look [Applause] ladies and gentlemen of Texas it is a great honor to be with you this evening and the media would love it and everybody would be out of here so fast you wouldn\\'t have come in in the first place when you get right down to but Democrats will never get that chance because Texas will never give it to them Texas remember the last election they said these phonies in the back they said Texas is in play they said you toss in Plato and I came here we had rallies like this thousands of people outside they couldn\\'t get in and I said why is Texas in play they say take because it\\'s phoning it\\'s suppression they try and get your hopes down there suppress this is just like fake news but they said Texas they said Texas is in play ladies and gentlemen Texas is employed this is Sierra and Texas is in play President Trump and I had guys on from Texas and they\\'re wearing cowboy hats Sid and a lot of guy you go I don\\'t know about you but I know something about Texas and Donald Trump is not gonna lose Texas I can tell you that and Texas is not a lot of God\\'s it big tough guys there on television I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about Texas is not in play and there\\'s that great November 8th we had that great great night and the polls closed at 7 o\\'clock and usually they have to take hours and you know sometimes at least even if it\\'s big they take a half an hour the Texas polls have closed and you know usually if it\\'s closed it takes hours and if it\\'s not even just like so close it takes a long time so they go ladies in general suppose have closed in the state of Texas Donald Trump has won the same right Donald the polls have closed in Utah remember the guy with a shaved head he was going to be my competition even Hillary beat him now he\\'s all these talk shows knocking the hell out of me all the time now even Hillary beat this guy in Utah right Hillary came in second I came in first by a lot but that was another one too close to call except ladies and gentlemen Utah the polls have closed Donald Trump has won the state of Utah just in the same thing and we won by we won by a lie and we won Florida and we won South Carolina and we won Georgia and we won North Carolina and we want Pennsylvania we weren\\'t a lot remember these phony people there is no way to get to 270 you had to get that this so I kept going to Maine I love Maine but Maine - you get one it\\'s cut in half Maine - you get one I went there four or five times because I get they got me up the phonies they got me up to 269 couldn\\'t get to 270 so I went there I won by the way I won Maine - I got one but I went there and I went there a lot that\\'s the beautiful thing about the electoral college you go everywhere you don\\'t just spend in three and you know winning the popular vote would be much easier I\\'d rather have that I\\'d go to four states and relax I went to 21 states I used to be a believer in the other better when I think winning that it\\'s like your track star you\\'re working out for the hundred yard dash or the mile it\\'s a different form of training it\\'s a different form but we did great they said he cannot get to 270 and they were right we got to 306 after decades of economics are and I have taken historic action to confront China\\'s rampant trading abuses and we\\'ve made great progress and our relationship with China is fantastic and great things are happening you watch they get it now they get it and a lot of good things are happening we\\'re replacing NAFTA with disastrous I mean it\\'s been to me probably I used to call it the worst trade deal in history I think the world trade has been WTO what a real beauty World Trade Organization that\\'s a real beauty they consider China a developing nation and because you\\'re a developing nation Ted right they consider China to be a developing nation and because they\\'re developing they get tremendous and we wrote him letters we don\\'t consider them to be a developing nation we don\\'t consider India to be a developed because they\\'re ripping us off and we didn\\'t win any cases at the WTO and now we just won seven and a half billion dollars of countries that would take it available and we\\'ve won a lot of cases lately we didn\\'t win anything for years practically now we\\'ve won a lot of cases you know why because they know I\\'ll leave if they don\\'t treat us fairly they know it and then the piggy bank is gone where they all robbed from we\\'re replacing the NAFTA disaster and we have to get this crazy Nancy Pelosi to put this thing up for a vote we have together and the u.s. MCA is a giant victory for Texas farmers ranchers manufacturers workers and oil the Democrats should pass it overwhelmingly they will but Nancy has to put it up for a vote do-nothing Democrats they do nothing no where is the Democrat betrayal of our nation more dramatic than on immigration in recent debates did you see these debates you believe what I\\'m competing with I don\\'t know when I had to compete with Ted Cruz that was brutal you know he\\'s he was the national debate champion story I\\'ve never told I never did that before right I ran for office all of a sudden I\\'m supposed to be debating tomorrow night I said who are these people the hell I don\\'t know all of them I know a lot of them I contributed to a lot of them they used to treat me very nice when I contributed to him not so nice when I was their opponent too changed a lot but I said let me see I want to see who are these people I\\'m going to a debate I never debated my whole life has been a debate but I never debated like with the podium and this and that so I said who are they and we had 17 people plus me we had 18 it was actually not 72 was 18 remember Gilmore nobody remembers him but we had 18 people I said who are these people are they any good at debating and I hired a debate coach and he lasted for about ten minutes I said this guy knows less than I do he didn\\'t know anything he didn\\'t know anything is true he said never ever interrupt while they\\'re speaking I said okay coach put me in coach and after a couple of those savings I mean I mean you can\\'t beat Ted Cruz if you don\\'t interrupt him it\\'s impossible but my first stroke so I see let me see the cards let me see the whole thing I want to see it I need help I\\'m going to be debating in front of millions of people and everyone\\'s saying do you think Trump\\'s gonna be able to debate professionally I said let me see these cards at all of them you know he was president of his class one guy one guy was a good debater in college he was this he was okay but they give me the first card Tetris and it says national debate champion from Princeton is that right and then national debate champion from Harvard I said to my wife first lady potentially I said my potential first lady I got a problem I said some of these guys are okay they were only president of the class almost all of them ran for president that list I never did I like playing baseball better but I said I said Melania and I called Ivanka I called my kids I said I got a problem Ted Cruz was the national debate he was the number one guy in college he was the number one guy in law school how do L do I beat a guy that\\'s that good at debating but we came out okay Ted and Ted Ted was tough smart as hell on top tough good man but it is Sir the first car I looked at seriously was Ted Cruz and he was he was literally I mean National Day was the best in all of college and in law school and he\\'s a talented guy in recent debates you see these people up there they\\'re not Ted Cruz believe me hey Ted you should turn democrat you would win the neck Grover now he says I don\\'t think so every single Democrat candidate for president raised their hand in favor of giving free health care to all illegal aliens they want to give more to illegal aliens and they give to American citizens you say that as president I will never allow the Democrats to take away your healthcare dollars and give them to people that are in our country illegally in fact I just signed an executive action to protect American healthcare benefits for all American citizens among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are millions of legal immigrants right here in Texas including millions of patriotic hard-working Mexican Americans who play by the rules pay their taxes follow our laws and strengthen our communities whether you are a first generation or tenth generation and every American citizen and you do you\\'ve been treated so badly but you\\'re not being treated badly anymore you know we got rid of the individual mandate from crazy Obamacare every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs your safety your family your borders and is always loyal to you for a change we\\'re loyal to you my administration has reduced illegal border crossings by over 60 percent since May and that\\'s with no help from the Democrats they won\\'t close up the loopholes they won\\'t close the loopholes and we could do it in 15 minutes and we\\'re building the wall and we\\'re doing all of these things but the Democrats won\\'t close up the loopholes you know what the loopholes are right how about catch and release you catch them you say hello darling how are you could you please give us your name and phone number that have a phone could you give us your address they don\\'t want to have an address that\\'s in Honduras could you please give us your address and your name they can\\'t they said that\\'s okay we catch and we release and they go into our country and then we are getting them out of the country and you know what some are very good people some are unbelievably dangerous and bad people and we\\'re focusing on the bed and they\\'re getting the hell out of our country okay while we\\'re fighting for shared priorities the American people the Democrat Party has never been farther outside of the mainstream they\\'ve gone nuts every Democrat running for president is pushing a health care agenda that would utterly eviscerate Medicare my administration will always protect Medicare for our beloved seniors and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 51 years people don\\'t talk about it the press will not talk about it we have news conferences we tell them this they will not put it in the press you have no idea how dishonest the media is you have no idea [Applause] virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment [Applause] and that crackpot governor from Virginia execute the baby after birth you saw that way after go you remember that one from last year that\\'s why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God Democrats are now the party of crazy politicians high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption they\\'re corrupt like Schiff is corrupt he\\'s corrupt the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and it\\'s the party of the American dream [Music] it\\'s also the party of Honest Abe Lincoln we forget that we got to use that more often don\\'t you think you know honestly I like data state we\\'ve confirmed it\\'s just honest title thank you explain that to them you\\'re right we\\'ve confirmed 152 federal judges to apply the law as written including two Supreme Court justices Neal Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh you know when I got into office they say the most important thing a president can do I actually think it\\'s defense but they say is the appointment of federal judges so when I got in always when you get in there a nun how many do you have I have none none so I gotta say how many federal judges do I have sir you have 142 federal judges as they you don\\'t understand the question that\\'s impossible that would mean that President Obama didn\\'t appoint a hundred and forty two judges you get none or you\\'re doing a bad job as president because you\\'re representing a different philosophy very different so I came I said no no no check it again then they said 138 then they came back actually sir the number is 142 we were right the first time 142 judges within two months we will have John and Ted and all of these great congressmen we will have passed 182 federal judges and then they say Obama wasn\\'t he such a wonderful president how are you wonderful president how are you a wonderful president when the most important thing you can do you hand it over to the Republicans a hundred and forty-two how is that going I mean how is that good if I were a Democrat I wouldn\\'t be too happy about that number and we\\'ll have a record number of judges by the time our term is over in 16 years maybe 20 I\\'m only I\\'m only kidding because every time I do that they say see she\\'s assuming control we have this crazy guy on television and he goes you know he\\'s talking to a guest he goes you know he\\'s going to win don\\'t you if you know he\\'s going to win I mean we\\'ve done a good job he should be happy but he said our military our schools our this everything he says you know he\\'s going to win and the guest goes won\\'t know what we\\'re gonna fight we\\'re gonna fight no no he\\'s going to win and you know he\\'s never leaving you know that don\\'t you he\\'s done he\\'s never leaving he\\'s never going to leave and I thought this wacko was kidding you know as a comedian I thought he was kidding he\\'s serious he really believes that we passed for the veterans VA choice and VA accountability on behalf of those great people they\\'ve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years they couldn\\'t get it done but those guys right there and me we got it done and to protect America\\'s security I would through the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal I recognize Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights for years you watched as your politicians apologize for America you\\'ve seen it many times oh I\\'m so sorry now you have a president to standing up for America and standing up for your great state of Texas you must never forget the 2020 election is about one thing and it\\'s coming up fast it\\'s about you it\\'s about you one thing about you I\\'m doing this for you you know we had on 2016 I really believe it was maybe the greatest election I guess George Washington was good but that was easy and by the way he did even better percentage was in judges that I did he had 100 percent but we could have 50 percent that\\'s not bad and I had many more than he had so I guess you got to give George Washington what do you think Ted you got to give him something I\\'d say yeah Honest Abe that was a pretty good election right Andrew Jackson they say are stopped Andrew Jackson but Andrew Jackson was a good election but we had among the greatest elections of all time but we have to now cement that election I\\'ve got to cement it and once we do it\\'s going to be very hard to take this beautiful experiment apart because it\\'s all about your family it\\'s all about your future and it\\'s all about the future fate of our great country so aboard with your help we will lift millions of more citizens from welfare-to-work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe modern fair and lawful system of immigration and by the

single cannon stared down a foreign army and it played come and take it and Texas is the state where generations of farmers ranchers pioneers and oil workers built a life and a home with their own two beautiful hands they didn\\'t have a lot of money they didn\\'t have a lot of luxury but they all had one thing in common they loved their families they loved their country and they loved their God

well thank you very much and hello tupelo this is great to be with you tonight the great state of Mississippi the great state of Mississippi and by the way the birthplace of a gentleman not too many people heard of him Elvis Presley but to be with thousands of incredible Patriots who put their faith in God family and country four days from now this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor Republican Tate Reeves great guy under Republican leadership jobs are booming confidence is soaring wages are rising crime is falling and our nation is stronger than ever before we\\'re now an economic powerhouse we\\'ve never been in a position like it we\\'ve rebuilt our military and we have financial strength and by the way for those of you with a thing called 401ks the stock market hit today another all-time historic high unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded ever recorded that\\'s not bad that\\'s not bad when you\\'re on the debate stage and you say we have the best economy we\\'ve ever had we have the best military we\\'ve ever had the best unemployment and employment numbers we\\'ve ever had said get the best president we\\'ve ever thank you [Applause] thank you very much and very importantly we\\'ve confirmed more than one hundred and fifty-eight brand-new beautiful federal judges to uphold our Constitution as with in a very short while we\\'ll have 182 federal judges President Obama left us a hundred and forty-two thank you very much thank you very much President Obama he left us 142 openings can you believe that you\\'re supposed to leave none when you leave office but that didn\\'t work out too well and just days ago the United States brought the world\\'s number one terrorist leader to justice we have great military it was very very depleted when I came into office it was very very depleted but it ain\\'t depleted anymore yeah al-baghdadi the founder and lead \\'add look you know you\\'ve heard about him for a long time I kept saying where is al-baghdadi that\\'s the one I want where is he and then by the way the following day we got number two I don\\'t know if you read about that but he was the founder in the leader of Isis and he\\'s dead and Baghdadi he was a savage and soulless monster but his reign of terror is over American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell I guess you could say he spent his last miserable moments on earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there going right up no enemy stands a chance against the righteous might of the United States military and Mississippi loves our military that I can tell you and our military loves Mississippi America is winning again and America is all over the world respected again it\\'s about time but while we\\'re creating jobs and killing terrorists the Democrat Party has gone completely insane the radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize we are the ones standing in their way and we will never get out of their way it will be easy from even before we won the election the far-left Democrats and the fake news media right back there look at all of them [Applause] it\\'s too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn\\'t they wouldn\\'t be here look at how many it\\'s like the Academy Awards before it failed and you know why it failed because they disrespected us but the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary you see what\\'s going on first they engineered the Russia hoax that was a total hoax the single greatest lies ever moistured upon the American people then the mower witch-hunt it never ended with 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget let\\'s go get him that didn\\'t work out too well did it that fizzled a lot of bad people along the way and now corrupt politicians Nancy Pelosi and shifty Adam Schiff shifty and the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment which and this is one I never thought I\\'d be involved in the word impeachment to me it\\'s a dirty word not a good word totally phony deal they know it everybody knows it and that\\'s why we\\'ve never had greater support than we have right now it\\'s true and if you think you have a lot of people in this room all you have to do is go outside you\\'ll see a lot more people trying to get in so if anybody wants to give up your seat please just walk out somebody anybody want to live because there really is there\\'s no place better to have a rally to have a good time and to also at the same time be very serious then at a trump rally especially on Friday night in Mississippi we could have done this one on Monday night he said let\\'s do Friday right Friday school yesterday the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives they\\'ve been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won but the people here that are highly sophisticated no long before I won nineteen minutes after I took the oath of office the horrible newspaper fake fake fake Washington Post declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun at least they gave us 19 minutes yesterday\\'s vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself but I\\'ll tell you the Republicans are really strong the strongest I\\'ve ever seen them the most unified I\\'ve the most the American people are fed up with Democrat lies hoaxes and extremism the Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do nothing Democrats out of office in 2020 make no mistake they are coming after the Republican Party and me because I\\'m fighting for you they don\\'t like it this is different they\\'ve never had anything like this so well they\\'ve never had an election like 2016 either have they I\\'ve never had they\\'ve never quite figured it out and they know they can\\'t win so let\\'s try and impeach him how about that crazy representative Al Green right you know we can I don\\'t beat him because we can\\'t beat them I don\\'t think so right I don\\'t think so Al Green he\\'s another beauty the Democrats the media and the deep state are desperate to stop us and is that me it\\'s us it\\'s all of us it\\'s 63 million but it\\'s much more than 63 million much more and right now our numbers are higher than they\\'ve ever been before so you know they\\'ve never been they\\'ve never been this low but they want to stop us because they know we are here and that\\'s what we\\'re doing and that\\'s what\\'s taking up so much time we\\'re draining the swamp in Washington nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying spying actually spied on my campaign can you believe it I mean you know they try and say well we were actually just checking things out oh that\\'s wonderful The Lying the falsifying over the past three years Plus before I ever even announced they were spying I guess they knew we were going to win right but over that past more than three years is finally being exposed and remember this that truth is a force of nature desperate to conceal their misdeeds the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Biden\\'s just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary\\'s shocking and very many misdeeds [Applause] 33,000 emails 33,000 emails disappeared but she said they only had to do with her working out and her daughter\\'s wedding 30 [Applause] [Applause] she\\'s a beauty how about last week did you hear I don\\'t know who Kelsie Gabbard is but I know one thing she\\'s not an agent of Russia and Jill Stein she\\'s a greenie that\\'s fine we love the environment everybody in this room you know right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we\\'ve ever had and yet when number one in the world in energy by far we took over but I don\\'t know Jill Stein she ran last time I don\\'t know but I know she\\'s not an agent of Russia and when Hillary made those statements two statements both of them they worked for Russia their agent of right I said you know when she made that statement about me three years ago it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement she made it about them everybody left because of what we proved but I\\'ll tell you what these are very bad people these are very dishonest people and the media is worse than all of them [Applause] but think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle I\\'ve just beaten with no political look look we didn\\'t have too much political experience I did a good job built lots of buildings all over the place had great success in show business just did one show was called The Apprentice that it was a big success 14 seasons and when I left crazy Arnold took over and didn\\'t do too well it was dead it was dead from the first episode I saw him I said oh it\\'s terrible what have they done to this beautiful show Arnold but think of it I\\'ve just beaten with no political experience the Clinton dynasty the bush dynasty the President Barack Hussein Obama dynasty and President Obama worked harder at defeating me then crooked Hillary Clinton did right he was all over the place it\\'s the only time I\\'ve actually seen him work hard when he came to trying to beat Trump remember he said remember he said he will not be President well that didn\\'t work out so well and then they figured they could take us out a different way very dishonestly right with the lying and the spying and the leaking and we are kicking their ass in the delusional democrat fantasy I\\'m now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe I used to come 1% cause he could never get 1% in the primers then he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap became vice president but we\\'ve now named him very slow sleepy Joe very slow he\\'s gotten slower and slower I\\'m afraid if he gets the nomination he\\'ll be so slow we\\'ll have the lowest rated debates in history as opposed to the highest rated debates in history against crooked Hillary in fact I don\\'t even think that sleepy Joe will get it but many people are running so you know it\\'s so early I don\\'t want to talk about their campaign oh did you hear Bader obey no did you hear that ah that poor bastard well poor pathetic guy he was pathetic remember the arms are flailing so remember that you know he ran against Ted Cruz Ted Cruz won he spent almost a hundred million dollars and Ted Cruz and I helped Ted and I we campaigned together and it was good but I used to watch him then when he came on to the really big stage his crazy stage I noticed he was flailing with the arms and he was standing on tables he was standing on counter tops I said does he ever like stand on the floor and speak but he\\'s waving his arms and going crazy and I said what the hell is he doing what is he on and you remember he made the statement that he was born for this anybody that says he was born for this they\\'re in trouble you know I used to have guys come into my office sir I\\'m the greatest salesman nobody can say you know the truth is anybody that says they\\'re great salesmen usually they\\'re not a very good salesman it\\'s true it\\'s those sneaky ones in the back that don\\'t talk but you don\\'t know about they\\'re the ones but bado was nasty and he said that he was born for it like he was born from heaven he came down and if that\\'s the case some really bad things happen because he made a total fool out of himself and he came out of Texas the great state of Texas he came out of Texas a very hot political property and he went back as cold as you can be so he was a nasty guy but he had a couple of policies that don\\'t work well in the state of Texas right he was against religion he was against you having a gun [Music] and he was against oil so you come from Texas you don\\'t like religion you don\\'t like oil and you don\\'t have guns I don\\'t know that\\'s not a good combination to the state of Texas that\\'s not good in Mississippi either that I don\\'t know is that good sector in any way now he went back home to Texas and hopefully we won\\'t be hearing about him for a long time it\\'s amazing how cold you could get so quickly but he was a nasty guy but in the twister Oh Alabama Alabama love Alabama I love Alabama it\\'s great place [Applause] but in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff after beating the entire political establishment and that means Bush and that means Clinton and that means Obama they have me supposedly saying to myself well let\\'s see I got a guy named sleepy Joe Biden how do I beat him how do I beat him how do I beat this guy he\\'s such a great Clinton she was easy right Obama was easy the bush dynasty was he but sleepy Joe I\\'m worried about right so then I said to myself gee I guess there\\'s only one way let\\'s call up Ukraine for help these people are sick these people are sick now these dishonest people will take the last little sliver in the first little sliver and they\\'ll put it because they\\'re so damn dishonest and they\\'ll just say let let\\'s use Ukraine for help that\\'s what they\\'re going to say and they won\\'t show the laughter and they won\\'t show the sarcasm and they won\\'t show the fun because they\\'re the most dishonorable people almost on earth it\\'s a disgrace but we say it anyway and here\\'s the good news the people get it so they have a brand new president in Ukraine good guy by the way and I call a brand new person the man I have no idea who yes and I\\'m on a phone right and I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country many people listen and I\\'m on the phone and they want me to say that this brand new president just got there called to congratulate him please could you help me please I don\\'t know who he is I didn\\'t know his name but I look down the card I say and he\\'s a nice guy and hopefully he\\'s going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems and hopefully and one of the reasons I held up money very important corruption but what the other reason why is in Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there why aren\\'t they doing things that they\\'re supposed to do why is it always the United States so I made this call had this wonderful call and the transcript proves that was as I say perfect it was perfect it was it like almost but it was perfect it was totally appropriate I made it at the behest of people to say could you call and say hello now I\\'m an honest person anyway but do you think when I\\'m making a call to a newly elected president of a country that I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening on the line and many people all of these people you had the Secretary of State Pompey a great guy he\\'s listening you had transcribers fortunately you had policy experts junior age low level staffers probably apprentice whoever the hell wants to listen they listen and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people and remember the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America the president I guarantee he\\'s got a lot of people listening to these people are sick so corrupt politician shifty Adam Schiff actually stood before Congress and stood before the American people and made up a conversation that he said I had with the Ukrainian president unfortunately no thinkable and many people saw that and it was a terrible he said terrible things the president of Ukraine said it was a very good conversation there was no pressures foreign minister said the same thing no pressure they must think when that\\'s to be honest it\\'s all a phony deal this whole impeachment scam to try to undermine the twenty twenty election and to D legitimatize one of the greatest elections maybe the greatest I mean let\\'s give George Washington credit but everybody expected he was gonna want that we\\'ve ever had [Applause] so my phone call which was totally perfect and appropriate and if you want to read the transcript you see how perfect it was but they don\\'t quit but what you should do is take a look at the behavior of sleepy Joe so I quote I said let me act like him I got to speak really slow though and I [Applause] said you\\'re not getting a billion I looked at them and I said I\\'m leaving in six hours if the prosecutor isn\\'t fired you\\'re not getting the money you understand you\\'re not getting the money then he goes at the end I didn\\'t know he had this kind of energy goes well son of a bitch he got fired you know in a certain way I was impressed because I mean I didn\\'t think he had the energy the brainpower it\\'s turned out he doesn\\'t by the way he\\'s dropping like a rock you know when you\\'re at 1% there\\'s always a reason he should be there fairly soon as you know the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold I think it was a billion dollars or something in a was the prosecutor investigating his son\\'s company that was paying hunter Biden a guy just got thrown out of the Navy he was paying millions of dollars even though working for an energy company he had no experience with energy he knew less about it than this young how old are you six this young beautiful person in front of me six and this young six-year-old is smarter so I think I\\'d basically go with her so what is it all about it\\'s called a payoff but you know what the fake news they apologize I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings Anderson Cooper well the hatred I mean between him and Fredo you got Fredo that\\'s Cuomo Fredo I call him Fredo like from the movie now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden the good news is Biden didn\\'t know too much about what the hell he was talking about it remember Biden said I don\\'t know these people I don\\'t know him I don\\'t know him he never spoke to his son about getting millions of dollars no he never spoke to him didn\\'t happen this victim think of this we\\'re dealing with life right he never spoke to him unfortunately the next day you know in the world of the Internet in the world of smart people that\\'s why I like bado wasn\\'t smart couldn\\'t handle it I told my wife I said see it\\'s not so easy I told our great first lady tonight who people love when bado quit like he quit like a dog when he quit I said see people think this is easy this is it easy but you know just worked out that way but Biden said I never met the people never met the gentleman unfortunately in about 10 seconds a picture came out where they\\'re playing golf together but he never met him so now you I asked him is it no we played a round of golf we were together for three hours I never mentioned the fact that they\\'re paying my son Millions oh no no no but the press protects him watch this crazy Anderson Cooper third-rate lousy ratings third-rate person but but listen CNN the worst I mean the worst was [Applause] Oh their light just went off see what the light was on they just told they don\\'t like it you know stuff you fake CNN now it\\'s tough I tried not to do that because I see their light on you know when their light goes on that means your life no that means your life and every time it\\'s tough look at all fairness they\\'re putting it on it\\'s a broadcast very few people are white well what they might be watching us I guess they do watch it but but here\\'s the thing and then you have the guy up there saying that they\\'re fake that they\\'re no good that they\\'re liars and cheaters that they\\'re phonies it\\'s hard to be broadcasting that when you\\'re talking about the network that has you on right so we understand their lights off and then [Applause] remember this Anderson Cooper what a beauty he used to interview me he was so nice prior to running for politics he was so nice to me it was like they were love fests but I don\\'t want anything to do with him they were love fest so what I thought he\\'s weak he\\'s a weak person but they\\'re all weak but let me just let me just tell you something we need honesty with our media [Music] because the New York Times The Washington Post and by the way I don\\'t know you probably read it we threw him out of the White House we don\\'t show them anymore if somebody wants to go and buy we throw him out and they came into my office and then I get I got to get back to this guy where\\'s hunter where\\'s hunter you know we had a t-shirt made where\\'s hunter where\\'s hunter poor hunter he then came out he did the morning show that was the last we\\'ve seen a hunter that was it good the morning of his father\\'s very bad debate but it\\'s where\\'s hunter but so before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while we get rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times we get rid of them right we don\\'t have them in the White House so now you the people can go out and buy it but we don\\'t we used to have them stacked up and I go in and I\\'d see a meeting with my people and they\\'re dealing with China South Korea or somebody and I go in and it\\'s go into these offices I\\'d see like 10 or 15 I\\'ve unpacked it all over the place the Washington Post New York Times I keep trying to figure out who\\'s worse and you know one day it\\'s the Times one day is supposed to take it\\'s like top each other they\\'re so bad it\\'s so phony it\\'s so in my opinion it\\'s virtually corrupt I\\'ve never seen you never have a good story I mean even with when we got al-baghdadi the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric where did that come from the other thing if Obama would have done it because look this guy built mices the Caliphate it was the size physically of Ohio the state of Ohio the great state of Ohio that\\'s a big lot of land 7 million people and they were the ones the orange jumpsuits I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to him and they were how can you be happy but they were so thrilled that we got this animal they were so thrilled but you know what and and you know what we don\\'t do if we do it because it\\'s right that story was a massive story that was the biggest maybe the biggest one of the biggest ever bigger than anything that story disappeared so fast done and that\\'s okay I didn\\'t do it for the story I did it because it\\'s the right thing to do but if that were if I were a Democrat if I were a Democrat they\\'d be talking about that story for weeks with me they don\\'t even wanna you know they actually played it down and actually and I\\'m happy about this Conan the dog got more publicity than me and I\\'m very happy about that I\\'m very tone is incredible and Conan\\'s coming to the White House in a few weeks but it is - did you ever see a story disappear so fast I mean here if Obama had that story that thing would be going on for another seven months they\\'d be talking about his bravery oh so bravery but again 142 judges he gave us remember that how can you be a great you know they always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges we get to Supreme Court\\'s great one great jack Dorset and Cavanaugh great judges by the way did you ever see any human being treated worse than now justice Cavanaugh did anybody ever was anybody was any human being by these people these horrible horrible people that we have to deal with anyway just to finish so hunter then goes to China now I\\'m dealing with China right now they don\\'t like me too much they dream about the day when somebody else and would they like to have how about this you give this son who has zero experience with investing two you give them 1.5 billion dollars to invest meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars and the biggest guys on Wall Street can\\'t get it he walks out with 1.5 billion dollars and then there are other places also I understand folks it\\'s disgraceful that the press doesn\\'t cover it for what it is it\\'s a payoff it\\'s a payoff and how would you like to have sleepy Joe with the Sun getting all of this money from China become president and take over the China deai they are not liking me they had the worst year that they\\'ve had in 57 years their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs are given us millions of dollars and billions now billions and billions of dollar we\\'re taking billions and billions of dollars and you know we\\'re doing with some of it just a small portion but a hundred percent they\\'re taken care of our farmers got 16 billion dollars last year and twelve billion dollars a year before because they targeted our farmers because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers so they targeted them and they brought the 16 billion down to practically nothing and they thought our farmers would say oh we don\\'t like Trump they did just the opposite they said we know he\\'s doing the right thing because we\\'ve been ripped off for so many years but I said to him I said to Secretary of Agriculture sonny Perdue Creek I said Sonny how much did they spend buying our corn and soybeans and all of our agricultural product he said sir 16 billion dollars they said good I\\'ll make it up and we\\'re gonna have a lot left over so we will have pretty soon over a hundred billion dollars in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us ten cents they only took [Applause] so when I said to the farmers we\\'re going to send you 16 billion it has already been said that it\\'s been split into 12 billion the year before and we think of that 28 billion I said compliments of China and we had a lot left over not bad right out there you think Obama would do that I don\\'t think so you think Hillary would do that I don\\'t think so you think sleepy Joe would do that I don\\'t think so he wouldn\\'t know what you\\'re talking about on Tuesday the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message it\\'s very important for this reason as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst but you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption they\\'re corrupt Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician you know when he made that phony speech where he made up as a really horrible speech and said that I said it I said oh I\\'m gonna sue him they said sir I\\'m sorry you can\\'t he\\'s got total immunity because he made it in Congress can you believe this but you know here\\'s the good news at least we have a forum we have a place we could talk so everyone knows what\\'s going on a bunch of phony people but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make take Reeves your great New Republic republican government right think he\\'s a great guy too and all I know is he\\'s loved and respected by your current governor because Phil is some piece of work you know Phil is so confident I want to fill the run for a certain office that I wanted him to do something I\\'ve tried to get him but you know some guys are confident feel said no sir I\\'ve been doing this all my life I love the people he built the most beautiful african-american museum Phil he\\'s the greatest but he built the most beautiful but he\\'s got confidence and he said no sir I\\'ve been doing it I don\\'t really want to do that in other words she said that\\'s enough most people are so insecure they keep going and going and going it\\'s not good I like Phil\\'s attitude better but Phil that\\'s great but I\\'m gonna introduce Phil in a second but Tate Reeves who Phil endorses and views as a champion for your state and really a champion for Mississippi values and Tate helped cut your taxes over 50 times including the largest tax cut in Mississippi history Tate is pro worker he\\'s Pro jobs he\\'s pro-family he\\'s pro-life [Applause] Tate is a true leader in the fight to protect the unborn the other side is not Tate Reeves will support our police oppose sanctuary shall we love our police right I love our food we love up a little Hill opposed sanctuary cities which is just terrible terror terrible and take will always defend your Second Amendment so Tate\\'s running against a Liberal Democrat named Jim hood now all I know about Jim hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama is not nice he wanted Obama to win so badly and then he wanted Hillary to win and that\\'s not the kind of guy we need here not in Mississippi he\\'s supported by extreme leftists like Stacey Abrams who by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentleman from the great state of Georgia Brian camp and they came in with all they brought them all they had President Obama they had Michelle Obama they had Oprah Winfrey they came in and all he had was Donald Trump and we won fairly easily but Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote do you believe this I mean some of these people they want to give them education they want to give them this they want to give them free health care they want to give these people that come into our country illegally more advantages than our own citizens have more advantages that our own military has Jim hood wants to raise your taxes he supports taxpayer funding for abortion providers he supports illegal immigration or all benefits and he opposed our travel ban which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country and Jim hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense if you don\\'t want a far left Democrat running Mississippi wait a minute how\\'s this guy you know I can\\'t believe this is a competitive race I\\'m it\\'s like embarrassing I\\'m talking to Mississippi you know I\\'m talking to Mississippi I can\\'t believe it I don\\'t think that he\\'s going to be the right guy I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves he\\'s going to be fantastic he will be a great great governor Tate come on up hey [Applause] Thank You mr. president Mississippi welcomes you because Mississippi is Donald J Trump country we gave you almost 60% of the vote in 2016 and next year we\\'re going to do even better and the reason is because President Trump is a strong leader he is the right leader to defeat the radical liberals who have taken over the Democrat Party now these radical liberals have been trying to remove our president from office since the very day he was sworn in they they have disrespected him and that means they have disrespected us Jim hood does not spent staying with our president he stands with the radical liberals [Music] when the radical liberals tried to stop the President on border security Jim hood stood with the Liberals when the choice was Donald J Trump or crooked Hillary Jim hood stood with Hillary Clinton and today with the election just days away I\\'m standing with president Donald Trump and Jim and Jim hood is standing with the Liberals now Mississippi it is time to choose it is time to stand up and be counted are we going to stand with President Donald Trump are you gonna stand with me on Tuesday let\\'s stand up to keep America great let\\'s stand up to elect a conservative there will be an ally to President Donald J Trump I need your prayers I need your support and most importantly on Tuesday I need your vote thank y\\'all Thank You Tate Tuesday go out and vote for Tate he\\'ll never let you down and don\\'t kid yourself your second Amendment is under attack not with him it\\'s under attack so we\\'re also joined tonight by a man who is truly and I\\'ve sort of said it a lot but he\\'s been a great governor and he loves

agriculture commissioner Andy Gibson Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney and former governor a man that nobody\\'s ever heard of in this room I\\'m sure but the truth is he\\'s a legend in politics and a great guy he\\'s a great guy Haley Barbour Thank You Alan great guy so with the help of everyone here we\\'re the hottest economy in the world we\\'ve created over 6.7 million new jobs since the election if I would have said during the campaign that I would create 6.7 million new jobs since the election these people would have gone crazy they would have said horrible things they would have said it\\'s impossible unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years soon-to-be historian african-american unemployment just dropped to the lowest rate ever recorded historic [Applause] really unimportant to me the african-american youth unemployment rate is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country we lifted 55,000 Mississippi residents out of poverty 55,000 hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election under the previous two administrations we lost 60,000 factories in our country under my administration we\\'ve already added nearly 10,000 new factories and many more are coming in as we speak to get relief to working families we passed massive tax cuts on average 2,000 to $2,500 per family bringing almost 1 trillion dollars back home to our shores what\\'s happening you couldn\\'t get the money the big companies they couldn\\'t get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint they brought back almost 1 trillion dollars now because of us all put to work we slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations and we ended the war on American energy we are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world for decades you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization two of the worst deals ever made by our country 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that and that\\'s awful and a big price to pay for Washington\\'s disloyalty to the American worker that\\'s what it was it was disloyalty stupidity corruption lots of reasons but now you finally have a president who is loyal to you and I am I\\'m a fighter for your jobs for your wages your factories your families and your dignity we\\'re stopping China from ripping us off we\\'re stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money we lose our wealth we lose our jobs we close our factories that\\'s not happening anymore it\\'s reversed we were the sucker country for years and years but we are not the sucker country anymore and they all know we\\'re replacing NAFTA and that was a disaster NAFTA with the brand-new US Mexico Canada agreement if Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote which is questionable nervous Nancy she doesn\\'t want to give the people of our country a victory she\\'s very busy doing other things having fun the u.s. MCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi\\'s farmers and also includes powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers manufacturers and everybody else it\\'s a great agreement about time we got rid of NAFTA the do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the u.s. MCA right now the last administration\\'s horrendous trans-pacific partnership would have destroyed the US auto industry but I proudly first thing withdrew from that job-killing calamity under our policies Toyota has just announced a 170 million dollar investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility did you ever hear of this place Blue Springs before my election our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global project all over the world we take care of other people we take care of other countries but we don\\'t take care of our own they knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries they deployed our military to protect think of this immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money I ask those wealthy nations now I respectfully the other day said to the king of Saudi Arabia King we\\'re gonna help you but you got to pay and he was great no he was great he was great he said but nobody has ever asked before I said but I\\'m asking and billions of dollars will come in and we\\'re protecting a great ally we have a we have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things but we said you\\'re very wealthy you have to pay and they\\'re gonna pay and that\\'s true in many countries by the way that\\'s true in many counties they never respected us they could never believe it I said to one country I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan I said to Prime Minister I said how did you get away with this for so long and he looked at me and he couldn\\'t really answer it because how the hell did this happen we\\'re protecting like 94 countries ask a China how many countries are you protecting President Xi and they look at me like what a stupid question we protect one China you asked President Putin how many countries are you protecting President Putin and he looks at he goes Russia you ask other countries we\\'re protecting at least 94 facts so many they don\\'t even they can\\'t even tell me I\\'ve been trying to get an answer for four months so many they can\\'t even tell it\\'s crazy but it\\'s all beautiful the way it\\'s happening a lot of good things are happening but these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you to take your money to take your jobs to redistribute your wealth all over the globe wherever they wanted it but I don\\'t like that the great sellout has ended and it ended the day I took the oath of office that was quite a day after years of building up foreign nations we are finally building up our nation we are finally putting America first our policy of never ending war regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interest it is the job of our military to protect our security not to be the policemen of the world proving the wisdom of this approach we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood that weren\\'t actually I have to be honest one soldier stepped on a nail that\\'s true I said don\\'t tell the press that because he\\'ll say but one soldier stepped in a nail I said how bad was it it\\'s okay I said don\\'t mention it please they always like to mention exactly what happened you could take it a little bit low-key stepped in a nail not not a drop of blood and we don\\'t have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria they\\'ve been fighting for a thousand years but what we do is we did keep the oil if you don\\'t mind we kept the oil [Applause] and we\\'ll distribute that oil will help out the Kurds and will help out other people will also help out ourselves of that\\'s okay past leaders foolish military adventures turned faraway nations into very very dangerous war zones then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted nations and regions I don\\'t think so I don\\'t think so we did not fight them over there only to invite them over here we don\\'t want to do that to protect our communities my administration restricted migration from terror prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures toughest ever that we\\'ve ever had no issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats they want open borders which mean crime they want sanctuary cities which means crime and drugs and death after bleeding the middle class dry Democrats threw open our borders to the world flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities we are now building a wall [Applause] we\\'re building [Applause] we\\'re building and you think that was easy the Democrats they didn\\'t want that wool I got money for everything but when it came to the wall not ten cents not ten cents but we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here we took it from there where we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases we\\'re winning cases now running a lot of cases but the wall is going up rapidly it\\'s going up rapidly and this is a very serious wall this is the exact everything they wanted I went to the Border Patrol incredible people and ice incredible people tough people they love our country and I said give me the specifications for the world they said well sir would like steel but would also like concrete I would also likely but I said well what do you want which one so I did all three because it\\'s a different form of cutting you can cut through steel but you can\\'t through the concrete and then you can\\'t through the hardened rebar we got it all and we also need see-through sir kind of see who\\'s on the other side that makes sense right not just concrete it\\'s more expensive what we\\'re doing but we\\'re giving and we\\'re building we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year it\\'s going intact and all the right areas in all the right areas that was a tough one and the Army Corps of Engineers is building the hearts out there great great people we believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country and thanks to our tireless efforts on the southern border tough plains illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May and we are faster than ever securing the southern border and soon it will be when the wall is completed secure like it\\'s never been before and I want to thank the country of Mexico they right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders and 27,000 you know that is and they are keeping people out and I want to thank the President of Mexico is an excellent person great man and we appreciate it and the reason is that our Democrats won\\'t even approve things called loopholes their loopholes that\\'s a horrible name right that means it\\'s a loophole that means you can come in illegally and lots of things catch and release you catch them then you got to release them by law you got to release them with a load they\\'ll arrest the Border Patrol agent of that or in it\\'s crazy but we could end this in 15 minutes but they don\\'t want to do it they don\\'t want to do it they\\'re obstructionist they\\'re colluding and we can\\'t let it happen that\\'s why you have to go with take Reese you know Tate\\'s gonna send Tate\\'s gonna send a big signal by the way it\\'s a big system it\\'s great for you he\\'s gonna be a great governor it also sends a big signal to these radical left crazy Democrats it\\'s very important that Tate wins very important we\\'re also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi which has banned sanctuary cities because phil Bryant said we\\'re not going to have them and Roger wicker said we\\'re not going to have and Cindy said we\\'re not gonna have him Democrat sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens to our straights if you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ice said they are heroes I wouldn\\'t want their job ms-13 they walk right into those nests they call Monessen and they start swinging and you\\'ve never saw anything like it I\\'ll say you know what better you than me let\\'s see who would do good he\\'d do good that guy that guy would do good mostly you wouldn\\'t do too good no I mean these guys are tough guys and they love our country who would do it they\\'re moving thousands of people from ms-13 these gangs are the worst people these people these are not human beings you know I said that once before and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said how dare you say that not you me you ever see these people and they sliced people up with a knife because it\\'s more painful than using again and then I have to defend myself when I say they\\'re animals but you know what I never changed I didn\\'t say oh I\\'d like to apologize I\\'d like to apologize crazy Nancy [Applause] and you got to look at her district in San Francisco she\\'s spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff take a look at what\\'s happening to the great city once of San Francisco its thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the Straits in the best neighborhoods Nancy Pelosi go home and fix your district Nancy go home and fix your district go home and fix you this to give you on a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ice and Border Patrol vote for Tate Reeves Tuesday gotta get out we gotta get out gotta send the signal let it be a big victory to the Democrat Party has never been more extreme you know that than it is today the Democrat health care agenda would obliterate Medicare I will always protect Medicare for our seniors and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always will always take care virtually every Democrat also now supports late term abortion repeat babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth while the governor of Virginia executed a baby remember that whole thing after birth after birth some people never heard of it he said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother nobody ever heard that that is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extremely term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American dream nobody has done more for the african-american community than the Republican Party and we\\'re also the party of Abraham Lincoln we can\\'t forget that people forget Abraham Lincoln Honest Abe to lift up distressed communities we created opportunities owns so incredible so successful including 100 new opportunities owns right now in Mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix and Tim Scott I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina we passed V a choice and VA accountability on behalf of our great veterans people said it couldn\\'t be done VA choice our veterans were waiting on line for days and weeks sometimes now they can go out choice they can go out get a doctor we paid the bill and they don\\'t have to wait six weeks four weeks two weeks we had people waiting in line they weren\\'t very sick by the time they saw the doctor they were terminally ill now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans the great rebuilding of the American armed forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville and Roger has been fantastic and Cindy hyde-smith has been fantastic thank you thank you thank you to protect America\\'s security I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal it\\'s not the same country anymore nothing\\'s easy but it\\'s not the same and I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem for years you watched as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi the next step to victory begins on Tuesday right here in your great state with your support we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history and you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high it\\'s I will tell you something if we didn\\'t win this election that stock market would be in one half it was heading in the wrong direction it was going to fail and if they ever did anything bad if they haven\\'t do anything bad to us if they ever succeed in their wildest dream which will never let them happen that stock market will crash like you\\'ve never seen a crash before and you will not be happy with your 401 k\\'s like you\\'re happy right now because they don\\'t know what they\\'re doing they don\\'t know what they\\'re doing and I\\'d like to speak well but the leadership they have no clue they\\'re just very vicious people actually they\\'re sort of mentally violent people but we\\'ve got it under control it always helps when you didn\\'t do anything wrong I always say how do you impeach a president who didn\\'t do anything wrong so we\\'re gonna send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson on Tuesday you\\'re gonna get out and you\\'re gonna vote and you\\'re gonna give up whatever you have to give up you\\'re gonna leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late tell your boss I said it was okay I will give you a pardon if I have to I\\'ll give you a one-hour part but with your help we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration and you have great congressmen here and I\\'ll tell you I won appreciate it fellas warriors you\\'re warriors you are warriors what was it 196 for and nothing against it that doesn\\'t happen with Republicans it doesn\\'t happen I always complain I would say the Democrats are lousy politicians they have lousy policies open borders sanctuary cities but they have one thing they stick together and they\\'re vicious the Republicans have great policy in many ways they\\'re better politicians but they\\'re not as vicious thank you darling I appreciate they\\'re not as vicious but they have a tendency to split apart the Democrats don\\'t seem to have any Mitt Romney\\'s we do we do I don\\'t know maybe he\\'ll get better maybe he\\'ll get better we\\'ll see we\\'ll see what happens maybe I\\'ll get better just let him be fair but they don\\'t have that we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful beautiful words made in the USA in America we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America can you believe that within 10 years it will be over when they told me that I said that\\'s incredible we\\'re going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years it\\'s funded nobody would have thought we could do that but we\\'re doing it we\\'ll have it ended in America in ten years the AIDS epidemic who would have thought we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true American Way we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag and we live by the words of our national motto and we always will you\\'ll never see it disappear in god we trust\\' we stand on the shoulders of American patriots who cross the oceans settle the continent tame the wilderness dug out the Panama Canal laid down the railroads revolutionized industry pioneered technology won two World Wars defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world and today it\\'s greater than ever before proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country that\\'s what we\\'re doing that\\'s what happened in 2016 we are returning power to you the American people with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning winning we get so tired of her

one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under God America is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi the best is yet to come because together we will make America wealthy again we will make America strong again we will make America proud again we will make America safe again and we will make America great again Thank You Mississippi thank you [Applause]

to re-elect you\\'re terrific Republican governor Matt Bevin he\\'s done a fantastic job a fantastic job and we\\'re sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country to the rest of the world that the Republican Party you know what we stand for but you see what\\'s happening with the Democrats they have gone crazy that do-nothing Democrats and then not getting it done under Republican leadership the economy is booming wages are rising confidence is soaring Kentucky is thriving like never ever before and America is stronger than ever before Kentucky\\'s unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country and I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor he\\'s had to do some things that you had to do and he\\'s done them unbelievably well and it sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future you had to do it so I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do but you have the best numbers you\\'ve ever had in the history of the state and with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the Constitution as written and we\\'re supporting our police we\\'re rebuilding our military with defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before the monstrous animal known as al-baghdadi is dead and the man that took his place is dead also [Applause] American Special Forces gave the world\\'s number one terrorist a one-way ticket to hell no enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military which is now stronger than ever before we\\'ve rebuilt it and it was all made in America all made and our country is winning again and our country is highly respected again but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the Radical Democrats are going totally insane they want to obliterate the rule of law drive out faith from the public square saya and you know this silence you online confiscate your guns [Music] [Applause] we better be careful the second amendment very very important very precious they are after your second amendment with us nobody\\'s touching our second amendment and that includes the gentleman that\\'s running against Matt they\\'re after your second amendment we can\\'t let that happen they want to indoctrinate your children you know this destroy anyone who holds traditional American values all you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School some of whom are here tonight the far-left wants to impose their authoritative ideology on the nation telling you what to think what to believe and how you should live they want to erase our traditions our culture our history and our heroes they want to subjugate you and break you to their will but Kentucky will never be broken Kentucky can\\'t be broken you\\'re too strong and you\\'re too smart in there crazed thirst for power the Democrats are trying to tear our country apart first Democrats engineered the Russia hoax the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people the Russian house then they did the Muller scam you remember that the mollusc in two years and they said nothing and then mr. Muller testified that was a wonderful day for me and you remember last week I don\\'t know tulsi gabbard but Hillary Clinton said that tulsi gabbard is a Russian agent I don\\'t know Jill Stein she\\'s a greenie and that\\'s fine she\\'s a greenie Jill Stein but Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also these people are crazy now corrupt politicians Nancy Pelosi of Adam Schiff they are corrupt and Nancy unlike Kentucky which is doing great Nancy oughta stop wasting time go back to her district in San Francisco help the homeless get rid of the drugs get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system what\\'s happened to San Francisco and what\\'s happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats it\\'s unbelievable Los Angeles you take a look at Los Angeles looks like a third-world city but go back to Nancy\\'s area look at what\\'s happened there\\'s been no place in the country that\\'s gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents and she\\'s wasting all overtime and you know what it\\'s backfiring you see it but the media and the Democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation with a deranged hyper-partisan impeachment with judge impeach so today we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market that\\'s hundreds of so last week think of this in the history of our country it\\'s never done better and by the way this that rich that\\'s that poor that\\'s for everybody your 401 k s-- how you doing pretty good right pretty good people tell me that their wives their husbands all of a sudden they\\'ve been running the 401 k\\'s for years and they totally lost respect for let\\'s say the husband totally lost respect

hopefully we don\\'t have to even think about it and that was going to happen here when we took over that was going down in the wrong direction and don\\'t forget that was zero interest we\\'re paying interest in other words people are now getting interest in their money but that was with zero interest real easy with zero interest last week the Democrats voted to try and nullify the ballots of tens of millions of Americans to be exact 63 million people disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives they\\'ve been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour

lunatics in the face of these attacks Republicans are the most unified that I\\'ve ever seen and I\\'ve been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time and the Democrats have never witnessed anything like it and they know they\\'re not gonna win in 2020 so let\\'s see what can we do to win but that\\'s not working too well you\\'ll see the American people are fed up with Democrat lives hoaxes slander the Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote that do-nothing Democrats the hell out of office soon tomorrow Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message you will vote to reject the Democrats extremism socialism and corruption and you will vote to reelect Kentucky governor Matt Bevin push done a great job Matt\\'s a veteran he\\'s a patriot he\\'s done it all he\\'s been a very very successful business leader he put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he\\'s done is incredible under his leadership Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs but I helped also we work together now he is difficult I have to say you know maybe a custom of the election but it\\'s okay here look he\\'s such a pain when he needs something for Kentucky like money like aid like he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky could you call the head of some company in Japan please I say Matt do I have to do it please please but isn\\'t that really what you wanted a governor that\\'s what you want he\\'s such a pain in the ass but that\\'s what you want [Applause] and the job he\\'s done one of the best in the country not the best he\\'s been incredible matters strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration thank you he\\'s Pro worker pro-life and 100% pro-second amendment and by the way you\\'re gonna lose your second amendment of you vote in Democrat you think I\\'m kidding I see what they\\'re saying I watch what they\\'re doing they\\'re calling me all the time you will lose your second amendment as soon I\\'m telling you I sure as you\\'re standing here is anybody sitting nobody ever sits you can sit if you what now just stand you know what they say the fact is look you\\'ve been standing nobody sat I don\\'t know it\\'s is that exciting nobody said you know what they said no you know what they say they say Trump only got one standing ovation because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down but they don\\'t save the second part that\\'s great great great spirit you know why you love our country and you see what\\'s happening we have turned this big monster ship we have turned it around and we need so badly you know it\\'s like you plant a tree it takes a look we have to get those roots to hold we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country so many things so many things the best employment numbers we have the best of everything and I think I\\'m gonna count but I think it\\'s like a hundred and eighteen I told you we have a record stock market today I think about a hunt I\\'m gonna have to check it because you know with the fake news if I\\'m off by a half a point if it\\'s if it\\'s 117 and not 118 even if I go under they report it they say he didn\\'t tell the truth it was really 119 but I like a lot over a hundred where we had the highest stock market in our history think of that that\\'s incredible but Matt Bevin has made record investments and education spending for Kentucky students education is so important to him Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values he loves this state from an all-out assault being waged on you from the extreme left not good I can\\'t even imagine how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left you know this guy Beshear is a major lefty you know that right why are we even wait let\\'s just have a good time are you sure we need an election tomorrow Matt I don\\'t know how does Kentucky vote for a person I\\'m telling you he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer H if T shift how about this guy how about Jeff he makes up a conversation he gets up before the United States Congress he repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine the new president a good guy repeats it I said I never said that he made a horrible statement it was a total lie and then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation and you haven\\'t heard about the whistleblower after that have you because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks you\\'re going to find out but these are very dishonest people shifty shift but Matt\\'s running against these people and we have to send them a sign because they\\'re dangerous the radical left named Andy Beshear who rejects everything Kentucky stands for that\\'s who they want to win Basheer is openly pledged to stop the policies of donald trump what are the policies take care of our vets take care of our military we want jobs we want companies to stop leaving us they\\'re not leaving anymore you see companies aren\\'t leaving anymore have you noticed remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this I mean when I said let\\'s do this I said they are great now first lady I said Melania let\\'s give it a shot and then one by one we were doing good and what we\\'ve done if you remember before we ran companies were leaving Kentucky they were leaving they were going to Mexico they were going to China Japan they were going all over any place but Kentucky you don\\'t read about that at all now they\\'re all coming back they\\'re all coming back but Beshear wants to shut down your coal shut down your energy raise your taxes and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky the greatest economy you\\'ve ever had he\\'s going to destroy it and it won\\'t be long it\\'ll go very quickly you know you\\'re all sitting there everybody has good jobs you don\\'t like if you go find another job it\\'s like the choice I got for military I got you choice to if you don\\'t like your job you find another when you tell the boss hey I\\'m getting out of here I like this guy you go get a better job for more money Beshear doesn\\'t represent you he represents the Washington swamp and he\\'s backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election Basheer supported crooked Hillary Clinton and he\\'s funded by the pro-abortion lobbying and open borders fanatics open borders let everyone pour right in let of all pour right in but sheer wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky think of that one [Applause] releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families he wants sanctuary cities he hasn\\'t learned what\\'s happened you know we had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina we won two House seats we were supposed to lose probably both of them and we want them by a lot we want to buy alive and I think we want them because of the second amendment because it\\'s under assault from Democrats but I think we want also because of sanctuary cities because some bad news came out of sanctuary cities really bad and I think that was a reason we won both House seats by a lot Beshear is too liberal too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky tomorrow everybody needs to vote Republican we got to go Republican all the way and I want to bring up a man and I\\'m I\\'m serious about this this guy worked so hard he\\'s a a great natural talent in business which you needed and he straightened it out and I\\'ll tell you what he will be one of the truly great in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state Matt Bevin come on up Matt how do you like having President Trump in Rupp Arena this is better this is better than the final four I\\'ll tell you what in terms of energy this is extraordinary Thank You Kentucky it is critical that we go top to bottom run the slate vote straight Republican but do your civic duty let\\'s get out and vote let\\'s send a message to Washington to the other states to the United States of America the Kentucky is leading the way and that we support the President of the United States Donald J Trump so we\\'re also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington your great senator Mitch McConnell nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch I will tell you nobody works harder and frankly maybe more importantly nobody works smarter it\\'s up here I know a lot of people that work hard he worked smart when the Democrat arsonist and washing tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh now justice red Cavanaugh Mitch refused to cave to the left-wing mob and that\\'s what it was it was a mob there has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Cavanaugh previously judged now justice we got a bin and he\\'s been great and he will be great Mitch confirmed to tremendous Supreme Court justices Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans now I know bitch\\'s opponent because they came here do you remember last year slightly different location and that\\'s okay it was still the great state of Kentucky because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath an extreme liberal against him and Andy Barr is here with us tonight and we\\'re gonna introduce him but he beat her so she said to herself well you know I failed in Congress now let\\'s go for the Senate she wanted to go to the house now she wants to go it\\'s not gonna work that way extreme liberal anti-gun lots of different things Amy McGrath compared my election think of this one it\\'s so insulting I shouldn\\'t say say yeah well I know it\\'s so insulting you know you work so hard you love your country so much and they get up to say things she compared it to 9/11 they slander upon our nation she wants open borders she supports the impeachment hoax witch-hunt like nobody and she wants to get rid of me she wasn\\'t too happy with me last year we came in Andy and we did a job in her and this is going to be easy and she was caught telling donors Democrats that she is further left than anyone in the history of the state of Kentucky is that what you want so next November the state needs to defend its values and vote for rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative Mitch McConnell but we\\'re gonna get back to that later we\\'ll be back many times we\\'ll be back here many times Mitch [Applause] well thank you mr. president for making America great again and Matt Bevin is making Kentucky great again thanks to your help tonight and working together we\\'re changing the federal courts forever nobody\\'s done more to change the court system in the history of our country than Donald Trump and mr. president we\\'re gonna keep on doing it my motto is leave no vacancy behind [Applause] so President Obama left Mitch and me and brand and all of us he left a hundred and forty two openings for judges you\\'re not supposed to allow any you don\\'t do that you know they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges right including the Supreme Court obviously and I came in and I said how many do we have and they said how many what sir I said judge openings and I thought they\\'d say none or one or two he said sir we have 142 I said what I said tell me again said we have a hundred and forty-two so Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama because nobody has ever been so generous also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy smart strong loves your state and he\\'s really become a good friend of mine and I\\'ll tell you he\\'s a little bit different it\\'s okay but whenever I\\'ve needed him whenever I needed him he was always there it\\'s true I mean sometimes like I\\'d say I don\\'t need your vote ran good then he\\'ll vote his own way it\\'s got that little libertarian touch that\\'s okay that\\'s okay but whenever we need and I\\'m not talking about me I\\'m talking about we we need a vote he\\'s so incredible and he\\'s become a really good friend and I want to have him come up for a second Rand Paul your senator a great warrior president Trump has great courage he faces down the fake media every day but Congress needs to step up and have equal courage to defend the president Hunter Biden made $50,000 a month that\\'s the definition of corruption we know he got it only because of his family connections we also now know the name of the whistleblower the whistleblower needs to come before Congress as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs I say tonight to the media do your job and print his name and I say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress to every Republican in Washington step up and subpoena hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower and I say to my colleagues if shifty ship will not let hunter Biden come and if you will not bring the whistleblower for every Republican in Congress should take a walk and say this is a farce Wow that was excellent thank you thank you very great job he\\'s a warrior he\\'s a warrior I\\'ve always said it also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are a fantastic couple from outside your state for will welcome them also right but these are also great fighters great warriors Hal Rogers Brett Guthrie Thomas Massie man we just spoke about one a great grace Andy Barr James comer right and from an incredible state that we won 2016 that crooked Hillary said she\\'s going to win that state didn\\'t come to close at winning that state it\\'s a great state and we love the people of North Carolina congressman mark meadows along with some of your local great politicians and a person that\\'s done a really spectacular job you know in Michigan a woman she just kept going she just kept going reminded me by the way of your governor from the standpoint she never quit now Republicans hadn\\'t won Michigan in many many years she called could you come again could you do it again could you come make another speech please I said all right this is the last one no no no how about a couple of war and then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton you better get going something\\'s going on in Michigan you\\'re gonna lose Michigan you better start going no no no the polls say everything\\'s good and we won the great state of Michigan for the first time in midian and I said when it came time to pick in the Republican party chair head of the RNC I said I gotta get the woman from Michigan Ronna McDaniel to head it up and when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign was you know we\\'re not sophisticated right I don\\'t think still remember you\\'re all doing the catwalk she\\'s got the finest computer technology in the world yeah she paid she paid for it but she didn\\'t get it she has really fantastic geniuses but I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had and his name was read parse Cal that he\\'s here with us campaign what a great job and our numbers are looking very good but think of it we\\'re one day short of a year now can you believe it less than a year it begins November 3rd this time we had that great great date boy November 8th remember was there ever a day like that in television history and they have no idea because when we do hang it up they\\'re all out of business they know that that\\'s why I think that we will get I expect to get a full hearty unbelievable endorsement very soon from the fairly New York Times and from the Amazon Washington Post [Applause] you know before the elections started about a month before I announced that I was going to do this I said I\\'ve never become a politician I can\\'t believe it I\\'m gonna become a politician but I looked at the New York Times that it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store right the wind would blow it away it was dead I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail but we built it up they do stories in my entire life I had a few stories of the front page of the New York Times and now if I have three or four a day it\\'s like why are they not covering me anymore and they\\'re all bad they only they can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world and they make it look as bad as possible in fact I love dogs but they gave the dogs full credit they didn\\'t give me any credit that\\'s okay the dog got the credit and the dog will be coming very shortly by the way to the White House but they\\'ll be endorsing us and you know all of these crazy like CNN with its bad ratings there goes its red life it just went off the red light just went off see well it\\'s hard look put yourself in their position they have it on their covering and now they know they\\'re ready to get hit so they turn it off I bet I can\\'t blame no the red light just went on no but put yourself in CNN\\'s position without us you know cable was not supposed to be a good business then we came along it\\'s not me it\\'s we they came from the valleys they came from everywhere the cities they came from places they\\'re still trying to figure out where the hell did all those people come from a great senator from Tennessee they have early voting and I was in Pennsylvania making his speech and he saw me because he had a couple of great congressman friends from Pennsylvania and he said you know in Tennessee we have very early voting and I just left and I\\'ve been doing this for 24 years and I got to be honest with you I\\'ve never seen so many people vote and these are people they love our country they\\'re incredible they work hard but they never liked what they were voting for so they really wouldn\\'t vote sounds terrible but they didn\\'t like anything that they saw they say sure I\\'m seeing people and he said this come out from the valleys come out from the mountains come out from areas that they\\'ve never come out we have lines at a five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor and he said I can\\'t speak for the rest of the country but of the rest of the countries like Tennessee you\\'re gonna have the greatest victory in the history of our nation and that\\'s what happened that was a great statement that was a great statement from people from a great state also tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket from Governor on down including your next lieutenant governor Ralph Alvarado Ralph Alvarado and your next Attorney General Daniel camera should I bring Daniel up get up here Daniel here\\'s the star here\\'s the star mr. president I hope you can tell that Kentucky is trump country we are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues in here in the Commonwealth we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves and mr. president we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians and mr. president I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state star a star is born a star is born you ever see that movie a star is born Thank You Daniel your next Secretary of State Michael Adams auditor Mark Harmon thank you Mark Treasurer Allison ball she\\'s doing great and agriculture commissioner Ryan Quarles with the help of everyone here America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world by far foreign leaders come in to see me congratulations on your economy China\\'s doing poorly as you know but they\\'re paying us billions and billions and billions of dollars and they\\'ve never given us ten cents before billions of dollars they gave a lot of that money to our farmers who got targeted but no longer they\\'re back buying from our farmers but we\\'ve created 6.7 million new jobs since the election and if I would have ever said that during the campaign the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it think of that six point seven and today just today a record 158 million Americans are now employed the highest level of employment in our country\\'s history african-american unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all-time historic lows the history of our country hourly earnings listen to this are up nine percent since the election nobody ever thought that was going to be happening under the previous two administrations we lost 60,000 factories I thought that was a typo I said outta hell can you lose 60,000 it turned out to be right and you know how I know because I\\'ve been saying it for two years and they never corrected me to him I get a call sometimes from the people on the campaign sir sir we have an emergency what\\'s the emergency somebody\\'s calling from the media the fakeness did you put a comma in the wrong location sir because they consider it to be a front-page story okay under my administration we\\'ve added nearly 10,000 new factories and many many more thousands of factories are coming into our country were reversed to get relief to working families we pass massive tax cuts massive to lift up the stress communities our tax law created opportunities owns Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved including 144 designated by your great governor by the way the other governor I don\\'t think not gonna do so well he\\'ll be calling for a meeting and I won\\'t be able to see him because I don\\'t like him very much but I like this one very much and we\\'re gonna help we slashed a record number of job-killing regulations we ended the war on American energy we\\'re now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world by far and we ended the war on beautiful clean coal I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible costly one-sided Paris climate Accord [Applause] ask them how they\\'re doing in Paris with it not too good I cancelled the so-called clean power plan and repealed Obama\\'s federal coal moratorium we\\'re putting our great miners back to work on trade we\\'re starting to set records every week we\\'re reversing decades of Washington disloyalty stupidity and corruption past administrations did nothing as China looted our factors and stole up to five hundred billion dollars of American dollars by the way people can\\'t even believe it not five hundred million that\\'s a lot if you lost five hundred million that\\'s a lot I thought that was another typo five hundred billion dollars they would take a year from us we rebuilt China and I give them a lot of credit by the way I give China what I don\\'t give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama I don\\'t give them credit because they let it happen they should have never let it happen but now we\\'re taking in tens of billions and billions and billions of dollars just recently very slow slippy Joe Biden that is said of China\\'s piracy and plunder they\\'re not that bad folks he owes use the word folks I watched him today he\\'s the word folks hi folks hi my time is up I gotta leave now they haven\\'t all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks so I could just see these handlers cuz their handlers like they use their horses the handlers right all right get him off now he\\'s been up there long enough so they\\'re screaming get off get off sleepy Joe get off the stage please please Joe you\\'re doing fine Joe you\\'re doing fine you\\'re doing fine and then he goes I love being in Ohio but he was in Iowa yesterday you see and they say damn it he shoulda left sooner and we told him get off this stage sleepy Joe sleepy Joe get off the damn stage but he said about sleepy Joe about China they\\'re not that bad folks they\\'re not really competition for us no they\\'re not 500 billion a year right he did nothing in eight years him in Obama fact I\\'m here because of them when you think about it right I\\'m here because of them Kelly and Conway stand up Kelly another warrior I just saw Kelly and I said no but think of it somebody saying that now look the 1.5 billion dollars at hunter who got thrown out of the Navy who had no experience who had not anything got a lot of money from Ukraine but he got 1.5 billion from China I gotta tell you I\\'ve been negotiating with China they\\'re very tough that is not the same group of Chinese people that I\\'ve been negotiating with they gave 1.5 billion he\\'ll make millions and millions with that and how about saying by the way mr. president would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling guess what you would be sold down the tube so fast and we\\'re so close China wants to make a deal so badly I think they\\'d love to see another president I think would they like they would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would okay can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made has to be because we started down here and they were up there has to be can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations this is what China would love more than anything else it\\'s not going to happen folks because we can\\'t let our country go back to hell we can\\'t do it we can\\'t let it happen because the Biden\\'s got rich while America was robbed and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in I watched the last debate and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying while it\\'s totally unsubstantiated mr. Biden totally answer what\\'s unsubstantiated he is on tape doing a real quid pro quo sir it\\'s totally unsubstantiated sir I\\'ve never seen anything like it could you imagine if I did what he did could you imagine if Don jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was let\\'s say vice president or president let\\'s say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion do you think the press would be saying well it\\'s unsubstantiated now it\\'s something let me just tell you something these people are not all of them but these people are very dishonest people okay very very dishonest but under this administration the great betrayal is over America is not for sale and we\\'re more determined than ever to drain the swamp and that\\'s what we\\'re doing with these crazy people a lot of bad things happened and a lot of bad things I think are gonna be revealed because there\\'s no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with let\\'s face it these are bad people thanks to my tariffs we will soon have over a hundred billion dollars from a country that didn\\'t want to do anything with us and I\\'ll tell you they started buying our farm product you see that they started buying a lot of our product even before the deals last year I got our farmers 16 billion dollars because they were targeted and the year before I got them twelve million dollars I just took them out of the tariff so we had a lot left over and I said congratulations farmers I love you I love our farmers they love me that\\'s why they did they targeted our farm I said congratulations that\\'s compliments of China and they do they want to make a deal so badly frankly honestly they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal that\\'s the way it is because we\\'re doing very well right now with China we\\'re replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US Mexico Canada agreement a huge win for Kentucky farmers for Kentucky Auto Workers for Kentucky manufacturers unfortunately Nancy Pelosi so far and the do-nothing Democrats don\\'t want to give the people of our country a victory it\\'s really let it be a bipartisan deal I don\\'t care it\\'s such an incredible deal for this country and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made Democrats need to pass the u.s. MCA we need their votes otherwise you can\\'t pass it and it\\'s up to Pelosi who has to put it forward but she\\'s too busy wasting their time so either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess the obama-biden administration\\'s trans-pacific partnership would have dealt the deathblow to the American auto industry that would have been one of the great catastrophes my first week in office I canceled that job-killing travesty you know all about it under our policies just days ago Ford and the UAW announced a 1 billion dollar investment in Louisville 1 billion before my election our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects they would globalists I was elected to be President of the United States not President of the globe they decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries tell me how is that good that try and convince you it\\'s good I was a very good student that we\\'re very like we\\'re all smart we sit back we listen and I say these people are something wrong with them they only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise you\\'re right about you are right about they deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money the money we spend on other countries militaries but it\\'s coming down and I\\'m telling other countries I\\'m sorry you\\'re gonna have to pay now I\\'m sorry pay hey you gotta pay and they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair we go in for Internet we want rural we\\'ll bring it in and we\\'re bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven\\'t been properly served we\\'re bringing it in all over the Middle West all over the country and we\\'re really ahead of schedule we\\'re doing really well people will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out but we\\'re doing very well but you were very much underserved for years and yet we\\'re investing billions and billions of dollars in places you\\'ve never even heard of does it make sense does it but after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation we are finally putting America first yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes through their failed policies of the past they believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world no thank you no thank you that\\'s why we ended the Paris Accord that\\'s why we were we vented over I don\\'t even want to tell you but the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that past leaders transform faraway nations into chaotic war zones then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions take the people take the people we defeated Isis we when I took over three years ago when we took over when I took over Isis was all over I defeated Isis you know I didn\\'t even know to what extent I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs and he said when Trump took over President Trump he used to say Trump is a great president then he said Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan then he said then he said no no Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan and now he\\'s got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln thank you we love you too but we didn\\'t fight them over there only to invite them over here we didn\\'t do that we\\'re not doing that you see what we\\'re going and you see what we\\'re doing and you see it\\'s never easy because I get hit by this swamp 15 different ways but it doesn\\'t matter we\\'re doing the right thing to protect our communities my administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world\\'s most dangerous countries a lot of people were against that they said isn\\'t that terrible countries that have crime rates that is so high you wouldn\\'t even believe it\\'s possible and we have a travel ban now we don\\'t take people from those countries I\\'m sorry and we want a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court ruled a totally constitutional or no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration Democrats want open borders they want to give illegal aliens free health care free education more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets in the Republican Party we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our southern border illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May the wall is being built it\\'s going up rapidly it\\'s got a big impact and I want to thank Mexico we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end Lupo\\'s it would take us 15 minutes so we could end the loopholes think of the word loopholes they don\\'t want to end a loophole if you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities you have only one choice tomorrow and that\\'s a vote for Matt Bevin Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day the Democrats planned government takeover of health care would obliterate Medicare what are they doing I will always protect Medicare for our nation\\'s seniors it\\'s going to be protected what they\\'re doing is crazy and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will also protect you with pre-existing physicians how about that pre-existing physicians first time I\\'ve ever said that\\'s just out of that true because under their plan you don\\'t get your own doctor you know what you get whatever the hell you get that\\'s what you get oh great doc fix me up doc you mean you want to work on my heart who are you doc I don\\'t think so thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor\\'s help we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky which is a record Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith anybody in here a person of faith great people the last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault it was an assault and Governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children and is no better leader than him what he has done and together we\\'re fighting for American orphans foster families and the sacred rights of religious believers and he\\'s done a fantastic virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from their mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth and that\\'s why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American Dream and it\\'s the party of the great Abraham Lincoln we forgot that right Abraham the incredible rebuilding of our military includes over 100 billion dollar investments all across the state of Kentucky I would draw our nation from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal it\\'s not the same country when I came in that country there were an 18 different sites of confliction they called it and now they\\'re a little different a little different we\\'ll see what happens with Iran and I recognize Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem for years you watched as your politicians apologize for America remember hey go round home thank you so much he wouldn\\'t apologize to you but he apologized to others now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky the next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you you have to do this look maybe you\\'ll be late for work maybe you\\'ll be late for whatever I don\\'t want to know everything okay some things I don\\'t want to know but you have to just put it off they have to go vote it\\'s so important tomorrow and so because you know beyond even the governorship and it\\'s so important because you see again your stage is setting records in the history of your state you\\'ve never done this well economically job boys unemployment employment factories moving in new factories open expansion of your car plants you\\'ve never done this well but you\\'re sending that big message to the rest of the country it\\'s so important you got to get your friends you got a vote because if you lose it sends a really bad message it just sends a bad and they will build it up here\\'s the story if you win they\\'re gonna make it like ho-hum and if you lose they gonna say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world this was the greatest you can\\'t let that happen to me and you know what you can\\'t let that happen to you\\'re incredible state Kentucky you can\\'t let that happen that would be a disaster for your self because you\\'d be losing an incredible governor but you\\'re gonna have a great victory tomorrow with your support you have to go out of it we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down so tomorrow we need you to go out and get your friends get your family get your neighbors get out and vote for Governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans tonight with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity together we will elect a Republican Congress 2020 we\\'re going to elect because of their stupidity these people are on the run and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand and don\\'t forget out of 194 we got 194 not one Republican left us last week and two Republicans think of that and the other three couldn\\'t get there because of it but they were votes they said they were totally if I said Airport problems I said you can\\'t do that Airport problems but then we had the Democrats we picked up two Democrats so we had bipartisan support that\\'s unusual I always say because they\\'re lousy politicians they\\'ve got lousy policy but they do stick together that\\'s about it we will elect a Republican Congress in 2020 I will have a great speaker of the house in Kevin we\\'re going to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending listen to this the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years we\\'ve already started who would have felt we could have done that we\\'ve started and the past administration toward the end we had certain things that we could have done they didn\\'t do anything they didn\\'t do anything but we did we have it all funded and we\\'ve started to think of that age within ten years we\\'ll be out of this country nobody would have thought that was possible we will end it great great they came into my office they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made it\\'s incredible what they\\'re doing and don\\'t forget write to try by the way where somebody who\\'s terminally ill can now use our medicines which

close election was it but it\\'s great to be with thousands of proud hard-working freedom-loving American patriots that\\'s what you are I\\'ve shown the people of Louisiana will head to the polls you

not a lot of people do that they say in Louisiana 40% of the vote is early voting I said like I said I think I\\'ll come but you\\'re going out to replace a radical liberal Democrat as you governor John John bel Edwards has not done the job you\\'re going to have a great new Republican tremendously successful man as your governor any risk phony any so early voting is already underway and I think I\\'m coming back here on Thursday you believe it I\\'m doing a double one of you really good anchors just interviewed me the locals those locals treat me good the fake news doesn\\'t treat me too good and he said you know you\\'ve been to Louisiana already like four times I said that\\'s because I happened to like it if I don\\'t like it I can\\'t do it [Applause] but early voting ends on Saturday and then you go out next Saturday and you vote and I just want you to get out do it early that way you can do watch your football games and by the way by the way this Saturday this Saturday I\\'m gonna be at a certain game [Applause] [Applause] the decided that I am going to be in a certain game let\\'s see it\\'s LSU versus a pretty good team from Alabama and I hear ya I\\'m a football fan and I hear you have a great quarterback we\\'re gonna see but I\\'m actually going to the game I said that\\'s the game I want to go to so that\\'ll be that\\'ll be tremendous two great teams to

America is stronger than ever before [Applause] we\\'re setting new records every day and with the help of Louisiana energy workers the United States is now you know you have some of the greatest energy and energy workers anywhere in the world the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on planet earth and we are supporting law enforcement and we are supporting our police [Applause] we\\'re rebuilding our military and you know where all this beautiful new equipment has made the Rockets the Jets the ships everything is made in America don\\'t we love and we\\'re defeating radical Islamic terrorists with the feeling and you saw last week the monstrous animal known as al-baghdadi is dead [Applause] you know if somebody else did that they\\'d be talking about it for months me I got about a day out of it from these people that\\'s okay that\\'s okay look at how many there are there you have a lot of people they have a lot of people you know it is true I\\'ll say who the greatest hero was forget about Trump I\\'m not here it was we did a lot of good work together every the dog was the great hero [Applause] Conan he\\'s coming to the White House very soon I said bring him now there\\'s a series on a mission I said you got to be kidding come on give a couple of days rest please but now Conan is coming to the Oval Office very shortly so that\\'s good but our message to these bloodthirsty savages is clear you don\\'t stand a chance against the righteous might of the United States military because America is winning again and America is respected again but while we are delivering safety and prosperity for Americans the radical left Democrats are trying to rip our nation apart they want to eradicate the rule of law punish religious believers silence you online indoctrinate your children and thereafter your second Amendment don\\'t ever forget it thereafter years and with the Republicans I can tell you one thing nobody\\'s going to hurt your Second Amendment nobody in their campaign to transform America Democrats are becoming ly increasingly totalitarian suppressing dissent defaming the innocent eliminating due process staging show trials and trying to overthrow American democracy to impose their socialist agenda make no mistake if the Democrats get back in you will have a depression the likes of which you\\'ve never seen before and you are doing well how are you 401ks doing by the way [Applause] you wouldn\\'t feel it all angry if they went down in half and then in another year half of that that\\'s what\\'s gonna happen first it was the Russia hoax then always Muller remember Muller or without hoax the biggest lie ever foisted upon the American people okay but everybody stuck with us if anything would became more popular maybe more popular I mean last week Hillary Clinton crooked Hillary as we affectionately call so is there any place you would rather be then at a trump rally on a beautiful wonderful evening in Louisiana I don\\'t even know would you rather be at LSU versus Alabama or a Trump rally let\\'s take the children [Applause] but Democrats must be accountable for their hoaxes and for their crimes now corrupt politicians Nancy Pelosi and shifty Adam Schiff and the crooked media have launched the deranged delusional destructive and hyper partisan impeachment witch-hunt now we go again things have happened because you know I don\\'t know if you saw it just got off I\\'m coming off the plane and they hand me a look at this character okay they just hand me the story coup assorted whistleblowers attorney said in 2017 you know when that was that was a long time ago it\\'s all a hoax they say January 2017 a coup has started and the impeachment will follow ultimately it\\'s all nah it\\'s all a hoax it\\'s a scam and you know who helps them these people right back here the media and then it said ups and lights going to go off to CNN light is gonna go up it said from the lawyer a sleazeball and said I predict at CNN will play a key role in at wheel Donald Trump not finishing out his first time can you believe this this is all and this was done a long time ago then he goes as one Falls two more will take their place referring to outgoing Trump administration employees who by the way have been put through hell by the sleeves back there and by crooked politicians it just came out that\\'s the whistleblower you know the whistleblower the one that came out with this old the Trump said this and Trump said that and then when they heard my real phone call the whistleblower disappeared shifty shifty is a corrupt politician Shiv didn\\'t want to have the whistleblower anymore because nobody thought I was gonna release the phone call but as soon as I released the phone call and you don\\'t like doing that with a foreign leader cuz you got to deal with foreign leaders you don\\'t want them to think today I spoke to president Erdogan of Turkey I don\\'t know is he worried that we\\'re gonna release it all over the world because somebody said something that could have been a little bit wrong you can\\'t do that you can\\'t do that now in this case I had a perfect phone call a totally perfect phone call and and you know anybody that can read you saw that on Mark Levin but the whistleblower before they knew I was going to release he came out with a whistleblower you know like he\\'s some wonderful person take a look at the whistleblower but the whistleblower came out with this horrible statement about this call so I really had no choice I said immediately talk about transparency I said release it release it immediately and then the whistleblower saw it as shifty shifts or there\\'s a total crook shift sought Pelosi saw and they said we got a problem we don\\'t want to have anything to do with the whistleblower anymore and the whistleblower disappeared you know who else disappeared the second whistleblower and you know who else disappeared the informer to the whistleblower if there was such a person which I doubt which I doubt just came out genna\\'s came out to disgrace I\\'ll tell you what it\\'s so bad these people are bad people and it\\'s so bad what they do to our country they rip the guts out of a country and it\\'s a shame and they shouldn\\'t be allowed to do it and people should stop maybe go to the Supreme Court maybe but they gotta stop it because we have a country to run and these people in order to do things are willing to do illegal acts to no legal act as far as I\\'m concerned last week the Democrats voted to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of Americans disgracing themselves and dishonouring their oaths now the good news the Republicans were unanimous the Republicans finally stood together they stood together [Applause] because you know the Democrats are lousy politicians lousy they have open borders how do you like having an open border with Mexico do you like the Democrats want open borders they want sanctuary cities you\\'re not too big and to sanctuary cities with John bel Edwards you will soon have a sanctuary city in your mess but the Democrats think of it they want open borders which means crime now look at what\\'s going on in Mexico and I\\'ll tell you what I have to thank the Mexican government in one way 27,000 soldiers but they have other problems these cartels are a tremendous problem we\\'re building and we are building the wall that wall is going up and it\\'s going up our military is now building the wall and it\\'s going up fast the Army Corps of Engineers and it\\'s going up and it\\'s doing great it\\'s doing great should have been built years ago that wall should have been built many years ago never did they never could figure it out but I figured it out it was it easy I had a hundred percent of the other party fighting me a hundred percent you think that\\'s easy and you know we had a majority of a few people very little very little we needed Democrat votes but we had a hundred percent of the people and I made one mistake I should have said I don\\'t want the wall and the Democrats would have absolutely insisted that I built [Applause] you know five or six years ago they don\\'t wanted the law it was only when I came along and I said we got to build the wall now you know you\\'ve wanted it but you never had the vision or the talent to get it built so we got to build it I figured that all joining and under said they said no we don\\'t want the wall anymore they said no no we can have drone technology course you got drones flying all over the place that\\'s great that\\'s great now we should have said we want to never build a wall and they would have insisted that it get built immediately these are I call them now that do nothing Democrats we have loopholes that they could solve in 15 minutes we could sit down loopholes catch-and-release chain migration you know that\\'s when you come in and then everybody ever met in the history of the world comes in with you your mother you grandfather your cousin your brother your aunt your uncle any person that ever met you come on into our country we had a man on the West Side Highway I don\\'t even call him a man I call him an animal he ran over a lot of people he turned right going up very very fast speed who had this beautiful Park in New York City and he killed I think eight people they never talked about the people that lost their legs that lost their arms that are permanently disfigured they never talk about that they say eight people were killed they don\\'t talk about people these are people that want to keep themselves in shape and they\\'re running and they\\'re running and they\\'re all over and then this maniac turns to the right going at an unbelievable speed and he kills people and he horribly injures people and we can\\'t let this happen we can\\'t let it happen these unhinged extremists the Democrats have been plotting to illegally overturn the election that we want I didn\\'t win it we all want it together they came from all over the place I mean you said is it that Republican and yet we\\'re so far up but I\\'ll come to see you anyway even yeah you could say you know focus on a couple of the closer ones but we\\'re gonna come here anyway and because we do love it 19 minutes after I took the oath of office the horrible disgusting Washington Post which is a terrible paper it declared the campaign this is 19 minutes I just think in the office and an article comes out the campaign to impeach President Trump has begun oh that\\'s nice thank you very much see the reporter over there right and then during the term sleepy show by news them as a rock said you fired the guy you got a billion dollars you don\\'t fire the guy you get nothing and it\\'s on tape and the repressed refuses to print it you talked quid pro quo you fire the guy you get up and you don\\'t fire you getting up they think of that one okay that\\'s called quid pro quo not here that was said by Joe Biden to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine who is looking at his son who just got thrown out of the Navy who was paid millions and millions of dollars even though he had absolutely no energy experience in Louisiana in Louisiana you wouldn\\'t have hired him in your energy companies they would have paid to keep him the hell out okay [Applause] how old is your son how old is that young man there how old are you how old ya eight let me tell you he\\'s a he knows energy better than Joe Biden\\'s son [Applause] then Biden flies to China he obviously met with different people than i deal with because we\\'re doing well with china but i\\'ll tell you but he flies with his father who was then vice president and in ten minutes he picks up 1.5 billion dollars for his fund these are different Chinese people that I\\'ve been working with excuse me I called up one of the top guys on Wall Street I said can you do that don\\'t I\\'ve been trying for years I can\\'t do it he\\'s like the smartest guy on Wall Street now the Democrats are covering up slow sleepy Joe and they\\'re trying to steal your vote and silence your voice and I don\\'t even know cuz I\\'m looking at Pocahontas she\\'s like can you imagine Pocahontas is starting to emerge from the ashes I thought she was gone we hit her very hard six months ago I give her credit she\\'s emerging from the ashes not a nice person 1024 in the in blood I have more than she does and I have none [Applause] I\\'d love to have some I just happened to have none but I believe I have more than she does generations of American patriots sacrificed everything they had to secure this Republic and your sacred right to vote we will not let the Democrats take that incredible privilege away the American people are fed up with Democrat lies hoaxes Spears slanders and scams the Democrats shameful conduct has created an angry majority and that\\'s what we are we\\'re majority and we\\'re angry that will vote to do nothing Democrats out of office in 2020 especially we\\'re going to take back the house and we\\'re gonna focus on like those 36 Democrats in trip areas areas that I won by a lot I didn\\'t run in 2018 you know they keep forgetting I didn\\'t run I said go out and vote gotta vote but a lot of people said I\\'m not gonna vote until Trump runs okay that\\'s nice I love those I love the people what we\\'re doing but I didn\\'t run in 2080 but people forget we picked up two seats in the Senate they never want to talk about that we picked up to see they never talked about it I tried to get him to talk about it and because of that what we\\'ve done with judges and different appointments but with your help we are going to drain the swamp and that\\'s what we\\'re doing [Applause] right now Louisiana can send the radical left a message that they can never ignore and don\\'t forget in 2016 people came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers and the oceans that came from all over the Democrat said what the hell is happening what are these people coming from these were people that were great Americans worked hard made a lot of money much smarter you know they call him the elite with the elite with the elite I know this I know this speaking for myself I went to better schools and they did I went to I have nicer houses and they do I have nice your apartments I have nicer everything and they were elite but we\\'re not an elite you people work your asses off you\\'re making a lot of money and teeth you ever see antifa you know what that is that\\'s the size of their arm they come in with the black Helena or their big tough guys and then they start hitting a single reporter conservative reporter they start battering with it but when the tough guys show up and t4 says I think we\\'ll take a pass let\\'s get out of here now you\\'re smarter get tougher you\\'re richer you got more going but a lot of people that came out because they didn\\'t like what they were seeing they didn\\'t want to vote for the people that were running for president he wanted vote for Obama then you want to vote for the people that were running for president but when I ran something happened that was amazing the lines were I tell you what in some cases miles long and they saw something they said what is going on and you know what I was going on probably the greatest election in the history of our country [Applause] I was just focused I was a person that was able to tell a message but I\\'m representing you and now these people illegally through corrupt people like Adam Schiff that makes up what I said he gets up in front of the United States Congress and the American people and he reads my sapin but I didn\\'t say it he made it up and then we called him on it because he never thought that I was going to release the conversation because you just don\\'t do that but Ukraine was great we called them up do you mind if we released a conversation no we don\\'t why I said don\\'t worry about it just we\\'re gonna release it Dermot thank you very much we released it and we caught them in the middle of a giant lie their scam their scammers [Applause] so you\\'re gonna fire your liberal Democrat governor I don\\'t know how the hell he ever got there how did he get there this is Louisiana right this is Lewis how did you get a liberal Democrat to be your governor could you explain that place now I actually know is a convergence of a lot of different things happened and congratulations and your car insurance is the highest in the world your taxes are horrible you\\'re rated number 50 in economic development can you believe it with all that we\\'re doing you rated 50 out of 50 but we want to send governor and I mean I know this man for a long time he\\'s an incredible talent he\\'s an incredible business man he doesn\\'t need the money he\\'s a wonderful person he has the backing of Ralph and I tell you what Ralph is a winner you know Ralph [Applause] he has the backing of Ralph I just spent a lot of time with Ralph Abraham we came in together Ralph would\\'ve missed it and he\\'s an incredible man he\\'s an incredible man and he respects Eddie and Eddie respects him a lot they had a hard-fought deal but they respect each other and like each other a lot and that\\'s rare because I\\'ll tell you what if I\\'m going against somebody I don\\'t know if I can ever like I don\\'t know but Ralph is a better man than me he\\'s a better man [Applause] are they\\'re gonna put that all over television tonight because they\\'re gonna say Ralph should run for president if that\\'s the case that\\'s okay now he is he\\'s a great man so Eddie was phony is not a career politician he\\'s a business leader highly highly respected a man of faith and a lifelong Louisiana patriot and many of you know it he threw a success and he will cut your taxes and regulations he will cut your car insurance in half we have the highest carry swords in the entire nation by far some people call it auto insurance call it whatever thank you what you have the highest in the country he\\'s going to cut it in half or more and turn this state into a giant magnet for great paying jobs that\\'s what he wants to do Eddie\\'s tough-on-crime strong on borders and he\\'ll work with ice and Border Patrol to get violent criminals off the streets we\\'ll bring them back to their country ideally or we\\'ll put them in jail where they belong EDIUS bro energy pro-family pro-life and pro and meant total Eddie will defend your values from the all-out assault by the extreme left that\\'s what they are there to the extreme left I call them AOC plus 3a Oh see that\\'s a real beauty you only have eleven years to live folks eleven years because climate change is just coming up on her sofa you know it was twelve years but today I heard one of these crazies say it\\'s down to eleven and they arrested Jane Fonda nothing changes I remember 3040 years ago they were she always has the handcuffs on oh man she\\'s waving to everybody with the handcuffs I can\\'t believe it they remember that she went to Vietnam to find out how nice they were they weren\\'t too nice to her by the way now they arrested her today Jane Fonda nothing changes they arrest every every 25 years they arrest her Eddie\\'s opponent is a radical liberal and you didn\\'t know that track even says good things about me but he\\'ll never vote for me you know why he says good things about me because he thinks you like me if he didn\\'t otherwise said say bad but here\\'s the thing he\\'ll say good things in fact I said he must be a Republican he sometimes says better about me than most Republicans but here\\'s the problem he\\'ll never vote for us he\\'ll never support our Second Amendment the way we need the support he\\'s never going to reduce your car as yours he\\'s never gonna cut your taxes he\\'s had a long time he wasn\\'t able to do it I got you a big tax cut the biggest ever [Applause] I mean the Democrats they have this crazy theory I don\\'t know how it works I don\\'t think I could be a successful Democrat you know one of their theories we\\'re gonna raise your taxes how does that work I\\'m always saying we\\'re gonna get you a bigger we are we\\'re gonna cut your Texas book they\\'re saying look what do I know I\\'ve only been doing this for three years but they say we\\'re gonna raise your taxes and I\\'m saying excuse me does that work that\\'s what they say now I\\'m gonna cut your taxes even further and you see what it\\'s done for our plant but you have a radical liberal named John bel Edwards Edward was an ardent supporter of crooked Hillary Clinton and she is crooked as hell John bel Edwards broke his solemn promise to the people of Louisiana when he rammed that\\'s the only word I could say ran through the largest tax hike in Louisiana history does everybody remember though he gave you the largest tax hike and then he probably says I\\'d raise your taxes vote for me no I\\'m saying this I lowered your taxes I gave you the greatest tax reduction in the history of our country greater even than Ron Reagan\\'s reduction many years ago now maybe that doesn\\'t work in modern day politics but you know what I\\'m gonna stick with it okay whether it does or not I\\'m sickened and you see what\\'s happened billions and billions and trillions of dollars is coming back into the country with a hottest economic force anywhere in the world anywhere in the world I\\'m taking him where the lower-right were taking in much more money than we did with a higher rate that\\'s a pretty good statement he violated your sacred trust and can never be trusted again he raised you taxes and he\\'s done nothing about your car insurance you know one of the big things here is car insurance right and I kept saying what are the things because I want to pinpoint it and I kept seeing car insurance that\\'s very unusual I\\'ve never heard that with the state I\\'ve never thought of car insurance right but here your car insurance is the highest in the in the nation and it\\'s out of control and it\\'s so easy to do now Edwards is trying to demolish your state\\'s economy by shutting down Louisiana energy on behalf of the crazy radical far-left Edwards is totally owned by the liberal trial lawyers who are causing your state\\'s insurance rates and car insurance to skyrocket through the roof perhaps most deserving Edwards has allowed illegal aliens to steal millions of dollars in health care from hardworking Louisiana citizens he cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about Louisiana citizens out there what I love our military Eddie loves our military they care more about illegal aliens than taking care of our vets and taking care of our military Edwards is dangerously soft on crime you know that Louisiana has the highest murder rate I hate to say this please turn off those television cameras immediately I don\\'t want to say but you have the highest murder rate anywhere in the United States I didn\\'t know that I didn\\'t want to say it okay I\\'m sure they turned it off because they really listened to them Edwards is backed by his fellow open border extremists and pro-abortion lobby Edwards is a complete disaster for the state of Louisiana and you cannot

thank you fellas two great guys they were with me right at the beginning I said who are they they said they\\'re two big television stars I said Wow and then I started watch it a little bit a lot of wisdom there Republican policies are lifting up Americans from every background and every walk of life America is an economic powerhouse again like never before or actually like never before we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations saving an estimated $3,000 per household we also passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history saving a typical family for another $2,000 and we\\'re boldly adopting a policy of American energy independence we don\\'t have to go to these faraway places anymore I was at the opening of the $10,000,000,000 Cameron LNG export facility in hackberry Louisiana employing thousands and thousands of Louisiana workers they couldn\\'t get their permits for years I got a real fast feet I said how long I said let\\'s go get them that permit for years and years they tried to get those permits they couldn\\'t get him I got him very fast now we cut a rip in a couple of months ago is incredible I\\'ve never seen a building like that one the more pipes in that building that I\\'ve ever seen before meanwhile every top Democrat running for president has pledged to abolish all American production of oil and natural gas shipping thousands of your state\\'s energy jobs overseas that\\'s all they\\'re done but Louisiana will not give them that chance we are reversing decades of disastrous trade policies Louisiana lost one in four manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization past leaders did not care one bit what happened to those Louisiana communities because they were getting rich by sacrificing your wealth to other countries you remember we\\'re talked about it all the time but under this administration the great betrayal is over America is no longer for sale [Music] thanks to my tariffs we\\'re taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us ten cents China can you imagine if we ever let the radical Democrats take over negotiations with China wouldn\\'t be too good let\\'s get hunter to do it right let\\'s get on come on Arthur come on hunter let\\'s see how you do hunter China would love it more than anything else they\\'d love to be dealing with a different president they actually do like me but they don\\'t like me what I\\'m doing exactly to them they\\'re having the worst year they\\'ve had in 57 years but it\\'s not going to happen that way because we can\\'t let our country go back to the days of being ransacked and plundered by other nations we will not be taken advantage of any longer before my election our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects they decimated American Factory you know this American manufacturing was broken and decimated to promote they promoted economic growth in foreign countries they didn\\'t promote economic growth in our country they used our military to defend immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money and they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into disrepair eight trillion dollars was spent in the Middle East and you want to fix a highway they say well that\\'s pretty expensive right not anymore but I was elected to be the president of the United States not the president of the world after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation and we are finally putting America first haven\\'t heard that for a long time past leaders transform faraway nations into chaotic war zones then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions stamping their visas for travel straight into your communities not anymore my administration implemented the travel ban to block migration from some of the world\\'s most dangerous and deadly places and we\\'re keeping terrorists criminals and violent extremists the hell out of our country that\\'s what we\\'re doing [Applause] or nois you have democrats more totally betrayed you than immigration they threw open and you saw it all through the years they threw open your borders to drug dealers human traffickers and to vicious ms-13 gang members and now we\\'re getting them out of the country by the thousands thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our southern border illegal crossings have now dropped 70% since May and when you look at what\\'s happening over there is a good reason for what we\\'re doing we are building that wall faster than anyone thought it was possible to build the Army Corps of Engineers we\\'re also confronting the deadly menace of sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens into your neighborhoods school zones and city streets Republicans believe our city should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans not criminal aliens [Applause] and Republicans will always stand with the heroes of Ice Border Patrol and law enforcement in the last administration vile slanders of our police went unanswered and unchallenged now we are once again condemning anti police bias and giving our officers the respect that say that they so rightly deserve if you want to show your love and support for American law enforcement and just plain success of your state in your country then vote early for any respond e Democrats are becoming more extreme by the day the Democrats plan government takeover of health care would demolish your Medicare I will always protect Medicare for our nation\\'s seniors we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will also protect patients with pre-existing physicians Democrats want to take away our doctors Republicans will strongly defend your right to keep your doctor you remember that with President Obama you keep your doctor you keep your plann 28 times it was a lie our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 50 years virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the boat ride up until the moment of birth that is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift [Applause] Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and the American Dream it\\'s also the party of the late great Abraham Lincoln people forget we have confirmed already 158 incredible judges to interpret the Constitution as written including two great Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh our historic investment in rebuilding the military has included more than 30 million dollars to box Cal do you know where that is Barksdale where\\'s Barksdale nice oh good oxtail Air Force Base right here in Louisiana and forty million dollars to never Naval Air Station joint Reserve Base in New Orleans I withdrew from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and open the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights after 52 years for years you watched as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Louisiana the next scepter victory begins in this day and it begins with you right now with your support we will show the corrupt Democrats and they are corrupt do-nothing Democrats that the American people are not backing down we need you to get your friends get your family get your neighbors and get out to vote early for any and if you don\\'t vote early I\\'ll be back on Thursday to get you to vote on Saturday ok [Applause] with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity together we will elect a Republican Congress we\\'re going to be able to do that we have to be able to do that to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration and many other things we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakfasts in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America did you know that within ten years I never knew we could do it until recently and we put up the money we\\'ll have the AIDS epidemic ended who would have thought we could have done that we will chart a new era of discovery in space and someday very soon we will land an American astronaut on the surface of Mars [Applause] we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true American Way we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag [Applause] and we live by the words of our national motto and they will never ever change as long as we\\'re here in god we trust\\' and it may be a hundred and twenty degrees in this room and I don\\'t know about you but I\\'m having a good time it\\'s a pretty little huh the little house somebody save it on an air-conditioning that\\'s alright always got to save a little money you go home you lose about nine pounds you say what happened well I went to Louisiana with some great friends and I lost about nine pounds and maybe boy we stand on the shoulders of American patriots who crossed our shouldn\\'t settle the continent tamed the wilderness revolutionized industry pioneer scientists won two world wars defeated fascism and communism and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater every single day proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country some really I mean do you believe what\\'s going on in Washington were these do-nothing somewhat evil and in some cases very evil people but that\\'s the way it is and here\\'s the story we\\'re winning we\\'re winning like never before [Applause] and if we weren\\'t winning they wouldn\\'t care life would be a lot of fun in Washington probably but we have to do what we were sent to do right we have to do it we\\'re returning power to you the American people with your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning winning we [Applause] let me ask you this on the people of Louisiana getting tired of winning is anybody getting caught because I could go to John and Bill and I could say fellas do me a favor they\\'ll come in they\\'ll be told by you senators were winning too much we can\\'t take it anymore there\\'s too much winning we liked our old way of life we had lousy jobs we got paid very little there was no business there was no nothing please go to Washington and see the President and tell the president please please stop winning so much we\\'re working too hard in Louisiana we\\'re winning too much and I\\'ll look at them and I\\'ll say sorry fellas we\\'re gonna keep on winning because we\\'re one movement we\\'re one people were one family and we are one glorious nation under God America is thriving like never before and ladies and gentlemen of Louisiana the best is yet to come together we will make America wealthy again we will make America strong again we will make America proud again we will make America safe again and we will make America great again thank you Louisiana thank you thank you [Applause] [Music] [Music] today [Music] I knew she was gonna be at her feet worse [Music] Oh you can\\'t always get what you want [Music] [Music] you [Applause] you know if somebody else did that they\\'d be talking about it for months me I got about a day out of it from these people and that\\'s okay that\\'s okay that\\'s okay look at how many there are there you have a lot of people they have a lot of people you know it is true I\\'ll say who the greatest hero was forget about Trump I\\'m not I was we did a lot of good work together every the dog was the great hero Conan Conan he\\'s coming to the White House very soon I said bring him now there\\'s a series on a mission I said you got to be kidding come on give them a couple of days rest please but now Conan is coming to the Oval Office very shortly so that\\'s good but our message to these bloodthirsty savages is clear you don\\'t stand a chance against the righteous might of the United States military because America is winning again and America is respected again but while we are delivering safety and prosperity for Americans the radical left Democrats are trying to rip our nation apart they want to eradicate the rule of law punish religious believers silence you online indoctrinate your children and they\\'re after your second amendment don\\'t ever forget it they\\'re after your second and with the Republicans I can tell you one thing nobody\\'s going to hurt your Second Amendment in their campaign to transform America Democrats are becoming ly increasingly totalitarian suppressing dissent defaming the innocent eliminating due process staging show trials and trying to overthrow American democracy to impose their socialist agenda make no mistake if the Democrats get back in you will have a depression the likes of which you\\'ve never seen before and you are doing well how are you 401ks doing by the way [Applause] you wouldn\\'t feel it all angry if they went down in half and then in another year half of that that\\'s what\\'s going to happen first it was the Russia hoax then it was Muller remember Muller with that hoax the biggest lie ever foisted upon the American people okay but everybody stuck with us if anything would became more popular maybe more popular I mean last week Hillary Clinton crooked Hillary as we affectionately call her so is there any place you would rather be then at a trump rally on a beautiful wonderful evening in Louisiana I don\\'t even know would you rather be at LSU versus Alabama or a trump rally let\\'s take the truck route [Applause] but Democrats must be accountable for their hoaxes and for their crimes now corrupt politicians Nancy Pelosi and shifty Adam Schiff and the crooked media have launched the deranged delusional destructive and hyper partisan impeachment witch-hunt now we go again except a lot of things have happened because you know I don\\'t know if you saw it just got off I\\'m coming off the plane and they hand me look at this character okay they just hand me the story ku has started whistleblowers attorney said in 2017 you know when that was that was a long time ago it\\'s all a hoax they say January 2017 a coup has started and the impeachment will follow ultimately it\\'s all it\\'s all a hoax it\\'s a scam and you know who helps them these people right back here the media [Applause] and then it said UPS the lights going to go off the CNN light is going to go up it said from the lawyer a sleazeball it said I predict at CNN will play a key role in at Weill Donald Trump not finishing out his first tent can you believe this this is all and this was done a long time ago then he goes as one Falls to more will take their place referring to outgoing Trump administration employees who by the way have been put through hell by the sleeves back there and by crooked politicians it just came out that\\'s the whistleblower you know the whistleblower the one that came out with this oh the Trump said this and Trump said that and then when they heard my real phone call the whistleblower disappeared shifty shifty Zakhar up politician Shiv didn\\'t want to have the whistleblower anymore because nobody thought I was gonna release the phone call but as soon as I released the phone call and you don\\'t like doing that with a foreign leader cuz you got to deal with foreign leaders you don\\'t want them to think today I spoke to president Erdogan of Turkey I don\\'t know is he worried that we\\'re gonna release it all over the world because somebody said something that could have been a little bit wrong you can\\'t do that you can\\'t do that now in this case I had a perfect phonecall a totally perfect phone call and and you know anybody that can read you saw that on Mark Levin but the whistleblower before they knew I was going to release he came out with a whistleblower you know like he\\'s some wonderful person take a look at the whistleblower but the whistleblower came out with this horrible statement about this call so I really had no choice I said immediately talk about transparency I said release it release it immediately and then the whistleblower sort and shifty shifts or there\\'s a total crook shift saw it Pelosi saw it and they said we got a problem we don\\'t want to have anything to do with the whistleblower anymore and the whistleblower disappeared you know who else disappeared the second whistleblower and you know who else disappeared the informer to the whistleblower if there was such a person which I doubt which I doubt just came out just came out it\\'s a disgrace I\\'ll tell you what it\\'s so bad these people are bad people and it\\'s so bad what they do to our country they rip the guts out of a country and it\\'s a shame and they shouldn\\'t be allowed to do it and people should stop maybe go to the Supreme Court maybe but they gotta stop it because we have a country to run and these people in order to do things are willing to do illegal acts Thun illegal act as far as I\\'m concerned last week the Democrats voted to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of Americans disgracing themselves and dishonouring their oaths now the good news the Republicans were unanimous the Republicans finally stood together they stood together because you know the Democrats are lousy politicians lousy they have open borders how do you like having an open border with Mexico do you like the Democrats want open borders they want sanctuary cities you\\'re not too big into sanctuary cities with John bel Edwards you will soon have a sanctuary city in your mouth but the Democrats that think of it they want open borders which means crime now look at what\\'s going on in Mexico and I\\'ll tell you what I have to thank the Mexican government in one way 27,000 soldiers but they have other problems these cartels are a tremendous problem we\\'re building and we are building that wall that wall is going up and it\\'s going up there it\\'s going on our military is now building the wall and it\\'s going up fast the Army Corps of Engineers and it\\'s going up and it\\'s doing great it\\'s doing great should have been built years ago that wall should have been built many years ago never did they never could figure it out but I figured it out it wasn\\'t easy I had a hundred percent of the other party fighting me a hundred percent you think that\\'s easy and you know we had a majority of a few people very little very little we needed Democrat votes but we had a hundred percent of the people and I made one mistake I should have said I don\\'t want the wall and the Democrats would have absolutely insisted that I build on I should have said you know five or six years ago they all wanted the wall it was only when I came along and I said we got to build the wall now you know you\\'ve wanted it but you never had the vision or the talent to get it built so we got to build it I figured that all join and understad they said no we don\\'t want the wall anymore they said no no we can have drone technology of course you got drones flying all over the place that\\'s great that\\'s great now we should have said we want to never build a wall and they would have insisted that it get built immediately these are I call them now that do nothing Democrats we have loopholes that they could solve in 15 minutes we could sit down loopholes catch-and-release chain migration you know that\\'s when you come in and then everybody ever met in the history of the world comes in with you your mother your grandfather your cousin your brother your aunt your uncle any person that ever met you come on into our country we had a man on the West Side Highway I don\\'t even call him a man I call him an animal he ran over a lot of people he turned right going up very very fast speed who had this beautiful park in New York City and he killed I think eight people they never talked about the people that lost their legs that lost their arms that are permanently disfigured they never talked about that they say eight people were killed they don\\'t talk about people these are people that want to keep themselves in shape and they\\'re running and they\\'re running and they\\'re all over and then this maniac turns to the right going at an unbelievable speed and he kills people and he horribly injures people and we can\\'t let this happen we can\\'t let it happen these unhinged extremists the Democrats have been plotting to illegally overturn the election that we want I didn\\'t win it we all want it together they came from all over the place they came from all over I mean you said isn\\'t that Republican and yet we\\'re so far up but I\\'ll come to see you anyway even yeah you could say you know focus on a couple of the closer ones but we\\'re gonna come here anyway and because we do love it but think of this nineteen minutes after I took the oath of office the horrible disgusting Washington Post which is a terrible paper it declared the campaign this is 19 minutes I just think in the office and an article comes out the campaign to impeach President Trump has begun oh that\\'s nice thank you very much see the reporter over and then during the term sleepy Joe Biden news numbers Iraq said you fire the guy you get a billion dollars you don\\'t fire the guy you get nothing and it\\'s on tape and the press refuses to print you took quid pro quo you fire the guy you got a million you don\\'t fire you get enough they think of that one okay that\\'s called quid pro quo not here that was set by Joe Biden to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine who was looking at his son who just got thrown out of the Navy who was paid millions and millions of dollars even though he had absolutely no energy experience in Louisiana in Louisiana you wouldn\\'t have hired him in your energy companies they would have paid to keep him the hell out okay he had no expand [Applause] how old is your son how old is that young man there how old are you how old ya eight let me tell you he\\'s eight he knows energy better than Joe Biden son then Biden flies to China he obviously met with different people that I deal with because we\\'re doing well with China but I\\'ll tell you but he flies with his father who was then vice president and in ten minutes he picks up 1.5 billion dollars for his fund these are different Chinese people that I\\'ve been working with excuse me I called up one of the top guys on Wall Street I said can you do that don\\'t my friend trying for years I can\\'t do it he\\'s like the smartest guy on Wall Street now the Democrats are covering up slow sleepy Joe and they\\'re trying to steal your vote and silence your voice and I don\\'t even know cuz I\\'m looking at Pocahontas she start can you imagine no no Pocahontas is starting to emerge from the ashes I thought she was gone we hit her very hard six months ago I give her credit she\\'s emerging from the ashes not a nice person 1024 Indian blood I have more than she does and I have none I have none but I have more than Shiva [Applause] I\\'d love to have some I just happened to have none but I believe I have more than she does generations of American patriots sacrificed everything they had to secure this Republic and your sacred right to vote we will not let the Democrats take that incredible privilege away the American people are fed up with Democrat lies hoaxes Spears slanders and scams the Democrats shameful conduct has created an angry majority and that\\'s what we are we\\'re majority and we\\'re angry that will vote to do nothing Democrats out of office in 2020 especially we\\'re going to take back the house and we\\'re going to focus on like those 36 Democrats in Trump areas areas that I won by a lot I didn\\'t run in 2018 you know they keep forgetting I didn\\'t run I said go out a vote got a vote but a lot of people said I\\'m not gonna vote until Trump runs okay that\\'s nice I love those I love the people but they see what we\\'re doing but I didn\\'t run in 2018 but people forget we picked up two seats in the Senate they never want to talk about that we picked up too soon they never talk about it I try to get them to talk about it and because of that what we\\'ve done with judges and different appointments but with your help we are going to drain the swamp and that\\'s what we\\'re doing right now Louisiana can send the radical left a message that they can never ignore and don\\'t forget in 2016 people came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers and the oceans that came from all of the Democrats at what the hell is happening were these people coming from these were people that were great Americans worked hard made a lot of money much smarter you know they call him the elite with the elite with the elite I know this I know this speaking for myself I went to better schools and they did I went to I have nicer houses and they do I have nicer apartments I have nicer everything and their elite but we\\'re not elite you people work your asses off you\\'re making a lot of money you\\'re smarter than that you\\'re smarter than they are and Tifa you ever see an Tifa you know that is that\\'s the size of their arm they come in with the black calomel or got a big tough guys and then they start hitting a single reporter conservative reporter they start battering with it but when the tough guys show up and Tifa says I think we\\'ll take a pass let\\'s get out of here now you\\'re smarter you\\'re tougher you\\'re richer you got more going but a lot of people that came out because they didn\\'t like what they were seeing they didn\\'t want to vote for the people that were running for president he wanted vote for Obama they didn\\'t want to vote for the people that were running for president but when I ran something happened that was amazing the lines were I\\'ll tell you what in some cases miles long and they saw something they said what is going on and you know what was going on probably the greatest election in the history of our country your election I was just folks Minh I was a person that was able to tell a message but I\\'m representing you and now these people illegally through corrupt people like Adam Schiff that makes up what I said he gets up in front of the United States Congress and the American people and he reads my statement but I didn\\'t say it he made it up and then we called him on it because he never thought that I was going to release the conversation because you just don\\'t do that but Ukraine was great we called them up do you mind if we released a conversation no we don\\'t why they said don\\'t worry about it just we\\'re gonna release it Yuma thank you very much and we released it and we caught them in the middle of a giant lie their scam their scammers [Applause] so you\\'re gonna fire your liberal Democrat governor I don\\'t know how the hell he ever got there how did it get there this is Louisiana right this is Lewis how did you get a liberal Democrat to be your governor could you explain that please now I actually know is a convergence of a lot of different things happen than congratulations and your car insurance is the highest in the world your taxes are horrible you\\'re rated number 50 in economic development can you believe it with all that we\\'re doing you rated 50 out of 50 but we want to send governor and I mean I know this man for a long time he\\'s an incredible talent he\\'s an incredible businessman he doesn\\'t need the money he\\'s a wonderful person he has the backing of Ralph and I tell you what Ralph is a winner you know Ralph Ralph a right he has the backing of Ralph I\\'ve just spent a lot of time with Ralph Abraham we came in together and Ralph woulda missed it and he\\'s an incredible man he\\'s an incredible man and he respects Eddie and Eddie respects him a lot they had a hard-fought deal but they respect each other and like each other a lot and that\\'s rare because I\\'ll tell you what if I\\'m going to get somebody I don\\'t know if I can ever like I don\\'t know but Ralph is a better man than me he\\'s a better man [Applause] and they\\'re gonna put that all over television tonight because they\\'re gonna say Ralph should run for president if that\\'s the case and that\\'s okay now he is he\\'s a great man so any respond he is not a career politician he\\'s a business leader highly highly respected a man of faith and a lifelong Louisiana patriot and many of you know Eddie through his success Eddie will cut your taxes and regulations he will cut your car insurance in half we have the highest car insurance in the entire nation by far some people call it auto insurance call or whatever the heck you want you have the highest in the country he\\'s going to cut it in half or more and turn this state into a giant magnet for great paying jobs that\\'s what he wants it done Eddie is tough on crime strong on borders and he\\'ll work with ice and Border Patrol to get violent criminals off the streets we\\'ll bring them back to their country ideally or we\\'ll put them in jail where they belong Eddie is pro energy pro-family pro-life and pro and meant told [Applause] Eddie will defend your values from the all-out assault by the extreme left that\\'s what they are there to the extreme left I call them AOC +3 AOC that\\'s a real beauty you only have 11 years to live folks 11 years because climate change is just coming up on herself and you know it\\'s 12 years but today I heard one of these crazies say it\\'s down to 11 and they arrest the Jane Fonda nothing changes I remember 30 40 years ago terrorists she always has the handcuffs on oh man she\\'s waving to everybody with the handcuffs I can\\'t believe it they remember that she went to Vietnam to find out how nice they were they weren\\'t too nice to her by the way now they arrested her today Jane Fonda nothing changed arrest every every 25 years they arrest her Edie\\'s opponent is a radical liberal and you didn\\'t know that track even says good things about me but he\\'ll never vote for me you know why he says good things about me because he thinks you like me if he didn\\'t otherwise said say bad but here\\'s the thing he\\'ll say good things in fact I said he must be a Republican he sometimes says better about me the most Republicans but here\\'s the problem he\\'ll never vote for us he\\'ll never support our Second Amendment the way we need the support he\\'s never going to reduce your car insurance he\\'s never going to cut your taxes he\\'s had a long time he wasn\\'t able to do it I got you a big tax cut the biggest ever I mean the Democrats they have this crazy theory I don\\'t know how it works I don\\'t think I could be a successful Democrat you know one of their theories we\\'re gonna raise your taxes how does that work I\\'m always saying we\\'re gonna get you a bigger we are we\\'re gonna cut your taxes but they\\'re saying look what do I know I\\'ve only been doing this for three years but they say we\\'re gonna raise your taxes I\\'m saying excuse me does that work that\\'s what they say now I\\'m gonna cut your taxes even further and you see what it\\'s done for our planet but you have a radical liberal named John bel Edwards Edward was an ardent supporter of crooked Hillary Clinton and she is crooked as hell John bel Edwards broke his solemn promise to the people of Louisiana when he rammed that\\'s the only word I could say rammed through the largest tax hike in Louisiana history does everybody remember that he gave you the largest tax hike and then he probably says I raised your taxes vote for me no I\\'m saying this I lowered your taxes I gave you the greatest tax reduction in the history of our country greater even than Ronald Reagan\\'s reduction many years now maybe that doesn\\'t work in modern day politics but you know what I\\'m gonna stick with it okay whether it does or not I\\'m sick and you see what\\'s happened billions and billions and trillions of dollars is coming back into the country with a hottest economic force anywhere in the world anywhere in the world and taking in more with a lower rate were taking in much more money than we did with a higher rate that\\'s a pretty good statement he violated your sacred trust and can never be trusted again he raised you taxes and he\\'s done nothing about your car insurance you know one of the big things here is car insurance right and I kept saying what are the things because I want to pinpoint it and I kept seeing car insurance that\\'s very unusual I\\'ve never heard that with the state I never thought of car insurance right but here your car insurance is the highest in the in the nation and it\\'s out of control and it\\'s so easy to do now Edwards is trying to demolish your state\\'s economy by shutting down Louisiana energy on behalf of the crazy radical far left Edwards is totally owned by the liberal trial lawyers who are causing estate insurance rates and car insurance to skyrocket through the roof perhaps most disturbing Edwards has allowed illegal aliens to steal millions of dollars in health care from hardworking Louisiana citizens he cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about Louisiana citizens I\\'ll tell you what I love our military Eddie loves our military they care more about illegal aliens than taking care of our vets and taking care of our military Edwards is dangerously soft on crime you know that and Louisiana has the highest murder rate I hate to say this please turn off those television cameras immediately I don\\'t want to say it but you have the highest murder rate anywhere in the United States I didn\\'t know that I didn\\'t want to say it okay I\\'m sure they turned it off because they really listened to them Edwards is backed by his fellow open border extremists and pro-abortion lobby Edwards is a complete disaster for the state of Louisiana and you cannot afford four more years of this far-left travesty it is time to replace your failed Governor John bel Edwards with any risk phony who\\'s going to do an incredible job so everybody needs to get out and vote early vote early 40% I can\\'t believe for it I never heard 40% usually it\\'s like 2% then they say don\\'t worry about it but early voting is started so get out and vote for any respond e and do it right away and then let\\'s go to the football game and let\\'s do lots of thing lots of things do it before the game we\\'ll just make sure you get it out and you know the election itself

here with the president that he actually came down to our community and let\\'s go Eddie [Applause] thank you fellas two great guys they were with me right at the beginning I said who are they they said they\\'re too big television stars I said Wow and then I started watch it a little bit a lot of wisdom there Republican policies are lifting up Americans from every background and every walk of life America is an economic powerhouse again like never before actually like never before we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations saving an estimated $3,000 per household we also passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history saving a typical family of four another $2,000 and we\\'re boldly adopting a policy of American energy independence we don\\'t have to go to these faraway places anymore I was at the opening of the $10,000,000,000 Cameron LNG export facility in hackberry Louisiana employing thousands and thousands of Louisiana workers they couldn\\'t get their permits for years I got a real fast feed I said how long I said let\\'s go get them that permit for years and years they tried to get those permits they couldn\\'t get him I got him very fast now we cut a ribbon a couple of months ago was incredible I\\'ve never seen a building like that one the more pipes in that building than I\\'ve ever seen before meanwhile every top Democrat running for president has pledged to abolish all American production of oil and natural gas shipping thousands of your state\\'s energy jobs overseas that\\'s all their door but Louisiana will not give them that chance we are reversing decades of disastrous trade policies Louisiana lost one in four manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization past leaders did not care one bit what happened to those Louisiana communities because they were getting rich by sacrificing your wealth to other countries you remember we\\'re talk about it all the time but under this administration the great betrayal is over America is no longer for sale [Music] thanks to my tariffs we\\'re taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us ten cents China can you imagine if we ever let the radical Democrats take over negotiations with China wouldn\\'t be too good let\\'s get hunter to do it right let\\'s get on come on hunter come on hunter let\\'s see how you do hunter China would love it more than anything else they\\'d love to be dealing with a different president they actually do like me but they don\\'t like me what I\\'m doing exactly to them they\\'re having the worst year they\\'ve had in 57 years but it\\'s not going to happen that way because we can\\'t let our country go back to the days of being ransacked and plundered by other nations we will not be taken advantage of any longer before my election our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects they decimated American Factory you know this American manufacturing was broken and decimated to promote they promoted economic growth in foreign countries they didn\\'t promote economic growth in our country they used our military to defend immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money and they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into disrepair eight trillion dollars was spent in the Middle East then you want to fix a highway they say well that\\'s pretty expensive right not anymore but I was elected to be the president of the United States not the president of the world after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation and we are finally putting America first haven\\'t heard that for a long time past leaders transform faraway nations into chaotic war zones then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions stamping their visas for travel straight into your communities not anymore my administration implemented the travel ban to block migration from some of the world\\'s most dangerous and deadly places and we\\'re keeping terrorists criminals and violent extremists the hell out of our country that\\'s what we\\'re doing on no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than immigration they threw open and you saw it all through the years they threw up in your borders to drug dealers human traffickers and to vicious ms-13 gang members and now we\\'re getting them out of the country by the thousands thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our southern border illegal crossings have now dropped 70% since May and when you look at what\\'s happening over there is a good reason for what we\\'re doing we are building that wall faster than anyone thought it was possible to build the Army Corps of Engineers we\\'re also confronting the deadly menace of sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminal aliens into your neighborhoods school zones and city streets Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans not criminal aliens [Applause] and Republicans will always stand with the heroes of Ice Border Patrol and law enforcement in the last administration vile slanders of our police went unanswered and unchallenged now we are once again condemning anti police bias and giving our officers the respect that say that they so rightly deserve if you want to show your love and support for American law enforcement and just plain success of your state in your country then vote early for Eddy respond e Democrats are becoming more extreme by the day the Democrats plan government takeover of health care would demolish your Medicare I will always protect Medicare for our nation\\'s seniors we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will also protect patients with pre-existing physicians Democrats want to take away our doctors Republicans will strongly defend your right to keep your doctor you remember that with President Obama you keep your doctor you keep your plann 28 times it was a lie our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in over 50 years virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the boat right up until the moment of birth that is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God [Applause] Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and the American dream it\\'s also the party of the late great Abraham Lincoln people together we have confirmed already 158 incredible judges to interpret the Constitution as written including two great Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh our historic investment in rebuilding the military has included more than 30 million dollars to bark scale do you know what that is you know where that is Barksdale where\\'s Barksdale nice oh good Barksdale Air Force Base right here in Louisiana and forty million dollars to naval Naval Air Station joint Reserve Base in New Orleans I withdrew from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights after 52 years four years you watched as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Louisiana the next step to victory begins in this state and it begins with you right now with your support we will show the corrupt Democrats and they are corrupt do-nothing Democrats that the American people are not backing down we need you to get your friends get your family get your neighbors and get out to vote early for any and if you don\\'t vote early I\\'ll be back on Thursday to get you to vote on Saturday ok with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity together we will elect a Republican Congress we\\'re going to be able to do that we have to be able to do that to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration and many other things we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America did you know that within ten years I never knew we could do it until recently and we put up the money we\\'ll have the AIDS epidemic ended who would have thought we could have done that we will chart a new era of discovery in space and someday very soon we will land an American astronaut on the surface of Mars [Applause] we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true American Way we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag [Applause] and we live by the words of our national motto and they will never ever change as long as we\\'re here in god we trust\\' and it may be a hundred and twenty degrees in this room and I don\\'t know about you but I\\'m having a good time it\\'s a pretty hot line a little hot it\\'s a little hot somebody save it on an air-conditioning that\\'s alright I\\'ve always got to

like never before and America is respected again respected at the highest levels every country that comes to see me they respect our country again but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the radical left Democrats is ripping our country apart they\\'re trying to overthrow American democracy and erase the votes of tens of millions of Americans first there was the Russia hoax then it was the Muller witch-hunt you remember that one so far much more than a hundred percent because it goes before the election ever took place we\\'ve been going through this from before the election took place a bunch of bad people and then one of the single greatest lies ever told by anybody in this government that I think one of the great scandals right from the beginning all of the things that they\\'ve been doing and now the absolutely crazed lunatics the Democrats radical left and their media partners standing right back there are pushing the deranged impeachment which out for doing nothing wrong doing nothing wrong you know we did nothing wrong and they\\'re doing nothing they haven\\'t done a thing since Nancy Pelosi is speaker they haven\\'t done a thing but once again their lies will be exposed just like the less times their schemes are already unraveling you saw yesterday how about when they asked these two never jumpers what exactly do you think you impeach him for and they stood there what like what but they\\'re unraveling and their sinister plans will fail they\\'ve already failed as far as I\\'m concerned in fact in fact so as I\\'m getting out of that beautiful airplane Air Force one it is a beautiful plane this just came out big story new remarks from top Ukrainian official damages Democrats impeachment narrative just came out I only read it because they don\\'t like to report stories like this you know about that because we\\'re fighting the Democrats but much more difficult to fight is the fake news I\\'m telling you and they\\'re a partnership I call them a partnership made in hell parodies Ukrainian foreign minister said on Thursday listen to this though and they won\\'t even want to report it a step because it ends it didn\\'t sit it\\'s all about that Ukrainian foreign minister said on Thursday that the United States ambassador did not link financial military assistance to a request for Ukraine to open up an investigation into former vice president and current Democratic president can you believe like we need help to beat sleepy Joe Biden I don\\'t think so you know last election by the way I hate to say this but now I have a lot of experience whose experience is important but talent is more important than experience right but I had no experience last election we took down the bush dynasty it\\'s okay [Applause] with no experience bush dynasty then we took down the Clinton dynasty [Applause] then we took down the very crooked Obama group so we took down Bush Clinton Obama with no experience but I had you and we won so think about that and then think about me gee let\\'s get some help from Ukraine in order to beat sleepy Joe Biden I don\\'t think so so just to finish this up so there was nothing no link no nothing two presidential candidates sleepy Joe Biden I added the word sleepy Chris is the serious deal here and his son hunter Biden Hunter where\\'s hunter what happened on I think he made more money than anybody in history for somebody with absolutely no talent or experience he\\'s number one in the world okay the Ambassador did not tell us and certainly did not tell me about a connection between the assistance and the investigation never said in other words nothing happened I have never seen a direct relationship between the investigations and security assistance so they have said now nothing happened and yet you don\\'t even read this now it only came out a little while ago no fairness I\\'ll give him a chance can you report this tonight and tomorrow please so so if Pelosi were honest which he\\'s not and of shifty Schiff little shifty ship he\\'s got the little little 10-inch neck what size shirts you need out of might wear size 9 9 he will not make the LSU football team that I can tell you and the neck is gone now he\\'s a bad guys that dishonest guy he\\'s the guy that went up and fabricated a whole story and read what I supposedly said to the new and very good I think new Ukrainian president and Adam shifty shift went up and he made up think of it he made up my safing and it was horrible what he said and he finished it by saying you don\\'t call me I\\'ll call you I said where did this come from he\\'s sick he\\'s sick but then once they happened here\\'s what happened you know what happened I said I better release the real call so they had transcribers to call is perfect and we released it and that was the beginning of the end for them they are disgraced now they\\'re just dishonesty and honestly they hurt our country incredibly badly because I don\\'t like releasing calls with other presidents and prime ministers you don\\'t like to do that you don\\'t want to do that but you had to because he totally fabricated he made up he made up my conversation he\\'s a thief he\\'s a crook and you know what he\\'s a corrupt politician and frankly he should be prosecuted the only problem is he has immunity because he\\'s a congressman and he made the statement in the halls of Congress he made the statement he made the statement while in that great beautiful building so therefore he has immunity so he can be crooked as hell in the meantime they gave the Republicans who by the way have really stuck together it\\'s a beautiful thing to see so we don\\'t have rights to lawyers we don\\'t have rights to anything we don\\'t have rights to it\\'s the most incredible thing but you know what by them being so ridiculous people see we\\'ve been taken away our due process has been taken away but here\\'s what we have we have truth we have the fact that everything is absolutely perfect [Applause] and based on the poll numbers and other numbers but based on the poll numbers the people of this country aren\\'t buying it you say it because we\\'re going up and they\\'re going down let\\'s keep it going for a while let\\'s keep it going for a while I mean I have one problem I have one problem and it has been it\\'s been very hard on my family who ever heard impeachment to me is a dirty word it\\'s been very unfair very hard on my family me it\\'s crazy what a life I lead you think this is fun don\\'t you but it\\'s been very hard on my family very very hard but I\\'ll tell you what I found the Republicans they stick together for them I mean they have really stuck but you know what they\\'re doing now the Republicans are coming sir our poll numbers are going through the roof do you think we could keep this going I said do me a favor let\\'s get it ended they said but let\\'s keep it going president it\\'s so great because we\\'ve never had a time like this I got a call from the evangelical leaders the other day a whole lot of them they said the church has never been more energized as it is right now because of what they\\'re trying to do to our president ever so we have a great group of Republicans but I said you know fellas I don\\'t know but they actually said let\\'s keep this sucker going for a while mr. president I said I don\\'t know something nice about ending it but it\\'s dirty stuff but let me just say with this from the Ukrainian prime right here from the Ukrainian president and the Ukrainian foreign minister this is the whole ball game so in theory they should end it tonight but they won\\'t they\\'ll find something they\\'ll find something these are very dishonest people Democrats are trying to overthrow the last election because they know they\\'re not going to win the next election that\\'s all and never forget the Democrat [Applause] the Democrats in Washington are trying to stop me because I\\'m fighting for you fighting for they\\'re attacking and they don\\'t that\\'s what he just said they don\\'t care about us who said that raise your hand it\\'s that\\'s right they don\\'t they don\\'t care and they don\\'t care about african-americans they talk they work for the african-american for an election and then people don\\'t hear from him anymore and remember what I said what the hell do you have to lose remember that they said that they saw that and you know what happened we have the best employment numbers and the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country records and they\\'re attacking me and they\\'re attacking the rub Republican Party really it\\'s an attack on the whole party because I\\'m taking on the broken establishment and restoring government\\'s loyalty to the people if you want to see what corruption looks like just watch the video of sleepy Joe and watch him as he brags about withholding a billion dollars and aid money to Ukraine until Ukraine fires the prosecutors gets rid of the prosecutor that\\'s been going after his son and his son\\'s company in Ukraine his son got millions of dollars from a company see how much he made before the father but was vice president so no experience no nothing millions of dollars paid approximately a hundred and sixty eight thousand dollars a month plus millions of dollars with no experience would anybody here take that job I think so I think I might take that job okay that\\'s a good job and then Hunter flew to China you know we\\'re making a great deal with China or we\\'re taking in billions in tariffs I can live either way they want to make the deal much more than I do but he flew to China with his father or an Air Force two which is a slightly smaller version of Air Force One and while the vice president was going soft on China his son picks up 1.5 billion dollars for his stupid fund that he never did before meaning he could make tens of millions of dollars a year and I was with the top Wall Street people the other day they love us because we\\'re setting records every week virtually of this either so which by the way means companies coming in and jobs jobs jobs that\\'s what it\\'s about but I was with the top guys that I was talking him there these are guys that do this for a living I said can you go into China and pick up 1.5 billion in ten minutes they said impossible I said well supposing like you guys can you do it can\\'t do it can\\'t do it but a guy with no experience can do it and the fake news doesn\\'t want to write about it but it will become a major campaign issue it will become it will become a major campaign issue Americans deserve assuming he wins which I hope he does I mean the only problem is we will have the lowest ratings in the history of the base because he\\'s a very sleepy person he\\'s exhausted Jo is exhausted tired game Americans deserve to know the truth but the fake news media they\\'re covering it up like they\\'ve never covered it up before ever in the history of our country in fact I saw a report today we kill al-baghdadi the worst terrorist head of Isis founder of Isis building a new Isis we were the ones that took a hundred percent of the Caliphate when I took it over Isis was all over the place we defeated one hundred percent of the Caliphate right when when we took down al Baghdadi two weeks ago they said President Trump out of the stories written had 64% bad publicity how do you get bad publicity not only that we killed him we didn\\'t lose one of our 68 incredibly talented and the fake news gave me bad publicity we can\\'t win the other thing one of the papers The Washington Post which is a terrible newspaper started talking about al-baghdadi as a great religious leader I\\'ll give me up if the other side would have killed him he would have been the worst human being ever created but he was a bad guy and we got him and that\\'s the way we wanted and that\\'s why we are more determined than ever to drain the swamp and that\\'s what we\\'re doing draining the swamp Washington Democrats have declared war on your values and the values of a great great place it\\'s called Louisiana have you ever heard of it so in two days you can show the far-left Democrats that you won\\'t stand for their socialism and their corruption you know your 401k sir through the roof right you know that since the election if you want to see him go down start voting Democrat you\\'ll see him cut in half you\\'ll see him cut a lot further than that one Saturday you need to fire your far left governor again he talks but he won\\'t be there when it needs a vote because when Pelosi and all of these characters from Washington call him up Schumer how about Chuck Bryant a I call him cry and Chuck because I saw him cry one time while making his speech I said isn\\'t that said I\\'ve never seen him cry before I call him crying Chuck crying Chuck little ear stuff you know little and you have a chance to elect a true Louisiana champion Eddie Crispo knee a real success father gotta get out you gotta get out you know in [Applause] in Mississippi two weeks ago we had a tremendous success we elected a governor he won by much more than anticipated really good guy and everybody down the ticket elected by more than people thought in Kentucky we elected everybody the governor got brought up in a few short days 19 points I went we made a speech the whole ticket was there everybody won big governor\\'s a really good guy but 19 points is a big thing and he lost by just a few thousand votes and the headlines the next day Trump took a loss I lift him up a lot so Trump took also you got to give me a big win please okay okay now he made a lot of hard decisions and he didn\\'t win but we brought him up a lot and the rest of Kentucky I\\'ll tell you what they had record record numbers but any risk phony you have to understand his pro-family pro-life pro-second amendment and 100% Pro America so I\\'ve known Eddie for a long time but you know you have to know a little background he was a very very successful guy made a lot of money he went against a phenomenally talented and a wonderful human being we all know Ralph I too loved Ralph and I\\'m gonna bring Ralph up here in a second any and Ralph they want criminal aliens off our streets and dangerous offenders behind bars and they want him behind bars and he\\'s going to cut your taxes you pay very high taxes in case you haven\\'t noticed reduce your regulations and protect Louisiana energy which is under siege if any of these other people get in you know what\\'s gonna happen there won\\'t be any energy will be I don\\'t know what the hell we\\'re gonna be doing right they don\\'t want any petroleum product they don\\'t want call they probably don\\'t even want wind with the windmills you know try liking a windmill when it\\'s 50 feet away from your house and blowing and noisy and the birds have drop it all over the place not that way now we want respond e by supporting any you will deliver a powerful rebuke to the socialist trying to sabotage our democracy and to erase your cherished way of life in Louisiana [Applause] and you really can\\'t you can send a tremendous message back to Washington because Eddie\\'s running against the failed far-left men John bel Edwards I mean he\\'s felt he has let you down so badly economic development he\\'s a tool of Nancy he\\'s a tool of Chuck he\\'s probably even a tool of that guy Adam shifty chef I don\\'t think flows very well down here he\\'s controlled by the same extremists who are pushing the impeachment witch hunt and John bel Edwards if he gets ever involved in that he\\'s gonna push it like hell and I honestly I didn\\'t have to be down all I do is make enemies cuz of you wins I got another enemy what the hell difference does it make I have so many but then I have an enemy in Louisiana I don\\'t want that and you need a Republican here everyone\\'s Republican you need a Republican not a Democrat [Applause] it\\'s one of the reasons he gets nothing done he\\'s a chosen candidate think of this john bell he wants open borders he wants radical pro-abortion policies and he loves the fake news media I hear they treated him great they loved him you know why they love him because he does what they want and what they want is exactly the opposite of what you want we know that a vote for John bel Edwards is a vote for radical leftists who despise your values hate your beliefs and want to crush the workers of the state you\\'re doing lousy compared to others that look the whole country\\'s doing great we\\'re having a great great surge like we\\'ve never had in the history our country\\'s the strongest has ever been but you ranked number 50 on economic development so you\\'re doing fine but you\\'re not doing like you should be doing and that\\'s after I gave you a 10 billion dollar I was down 2 months ago on the LNG plant on the Gulf right a 10 billion dollar plant and now they want to expand it it\\'s doing so well Ed\\'s words broke his solemn vow to the people of Louisiana when he rammed through the largest tax site he went he pushed through the largest tax hike in the history of your state he lied to you he double-crossed you and you can never trust him he will not vote for us it\\'s called make America great again it\\'s called keep America great [Applause] and just to finish up and I want to hit him strong because what the hell he hates me now I mean I don\\'t know I don\\'t think he ever liked me although he used to really be nice to me in person he used to go out and say I really like I really like the president then he\\'d go inside and Satre like him at all but just to finish up he\\'s in the pocket of the trial lawyers who have sent your car insurance rate to the highest level anywhere in the United States it\\'s crazy he allowed illegal aliens to steal millions of healthcare dollars from hard-working Louisiana families and John bel Edwards supports illegal aliens not American citizens pretty pretty simple and here\\'s another one that I hate to say because we don\\'t want to hurt your state but on John bel Edwards watch Louisiana has the highest murder rate in all of America do you know that so on Saturday your choice is clear you got to send a message back a vote for John bel Edwards your current governor where your taxes are too high your car insurance is a disaster your unemployment compared to other states isn\\'t great at all your 50th in economic development and number one in murders it\\'s a vote for the Washington swamp it\\'s a vote for the Washington establishment so when Saturday get out that\\'s the last of it now get out and vote for any respond who\\'s for jobs safety and freedom [Applause] so with that man that was the long harangue but I want to make I want to seriously I want to put it in yet it\\'s very important and you know what even if John Bell wanted to do good he can\\'t he\\'s got to go through all the Republicans they can\\'t stand this guy so you got a vote for Eddie Eddie could I ask Eddie to come on up and say a few words Eddie Eddie risk-on get out and go [Music] awesome Thank You mr. president thank you for being here Louisiana we are Trump country [Applause] wila President Trump and he loves Louisiana you might not know this but this is the fourth time he\\'s been to Louisiana to help us win back our state [Applause] he went to Alabama last weekend to help the LSU Tigers beat Bama [Applause] now we have to now we have to fire our liberal tax-and-spend socialists leaning Governor John bel Edwards [Applause] John Bell Elvis has been he has passed the highest tax in the history of Louisiana he\\'s attacked to all in gas ninja to where we\\'ve lost thousands of jobs he is released over a thousand dangerous criminals he supports New Orleans as a sanctuary city [Applause] and here he and his greedy trial lawyer friends they are causing us to have the second highest car insurance in America we have to get rid of John bel Edwards and we need your help but this is bigger than Louisiana we have got to send a message to these liberals socialists Democrats in Washington that we support our president and we\\'re not going to put up with all the lies that you called an out us home let\\'s send a message to him [Applause] and like the president just said how do we send that message is that we elect me as your governor and say that we are going to fire John bill and we\\'re going to be back where we belong we are a red state we\\'re going to work with the conservatives we\\'re going to work with this president to make number Louisiana number one in his South when it comes to jobs and opportunities [Applause] for our children and grandchildren so they can stay here in call the weazy Ana home that\\'s what we hear for folks we want them to stay here [Applause] and what can you do you can vote for me send a message to Washington turn our state around but we\\'re going to need your help we need to get out the vote we need to tell our friends and families and

agreement thank you for taking care of our military thank you for taking care of our law enforcement and Pelosi will not allow us to vote on that in the United States Congress this great president has got our backs but Pelosi won\\'t let us vote on that now mr. president mr. president in Louisiana we know what horse manure looks like and we know that this impeachment inquiry is a trunk full of it and we know that Pelosi in Adams shelf are up to their necks in it and I\\'ve got a new theme song for Adam shield it\\'s Marvin Gaye\\'s we heard it through the grapevine because there is no direct conversation except between you and President szalinski and you said it mr. Trump they can\\'t beat you at the polls so they\\'re trying to overturn our vote in the last election we\\'re not going to let that happen we also said president Thank You mr. president for pointing

want to interrupt other things that you\\'re doing I always like Friday night for these things but I\\'ll tell you what this is some Thursday night would you rather be anyplace else that a Trump ballot right a truck rally on Thursday night now but with the help of everyone here tonight America is booming like never before we created 6.7 million new jobs unemployment recently reached the lowest rate in over 50 years think of the half a century african-american unemployment just reached its lowest rate ever recorded history Hispanic American Asian American unemployment have also recently hit the lowest rates in the history of our country African American poverty has reached the lowest rate in the history of our country nearly 2.5 million people have risen out of poverty the number of Americans quitting the job they hate to take a new job is higher than ever before you go out get another job you\\'re not stuck in a job you don\\'t want and you get more money when you go out sometimes that hasn\\'t happened in many many decades after years of painful stagnation of decline wages and incomes are rising at one of the fastest rates in history real wages for low-income workers have gone up nearly nine percent average median income under President Bush as an example rose only $400 over an eight-year period $400 over 8 years under President Obama it rose only 975 dollars over eight years and under your favorite president [Applause] it rose $5,000 in just two and a half years [Applause] in addition in our case to the 5000 we can add another $5,000 in savings from tax cuts regulation cuts and energy production and energy costs so when you ended up it went up four hundred dollars for President Bush nine hundred and seventy five dollars under President Obama those are eight years and eight years and just a little more than two and a half years it went up ten thousand dollars under President that\\'s pretty good those are tough numbers to be we\\'re boldly adopting a policy of American energy independence which is great for your state in particular Texas happens to be pretty happy also and you know what North Dakota is not too unhappy we got a lot of states that are very happy America is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world [Applause] meanwhile the far-left Democrats in Washington want to abolish the production of oil and natural gas how do you like that idea how about this clown bado he was against guns religion and oil and he lives in Texas that\\'s not going to work somebody called him and explained that wasn\\'t a good idea well you know the Democrats want to raise your taxes my whole life it was the politician that could lower taxes we gave you the biggest tax decrease in the history of our country and that was always like a good thing they want to raise you taxes and I\\'m trying to figure out because I\\'ve been doing this for a lot shorter time than most of them trying to figure out how does that work we\\'re gonna raise your taxes is that a good thing I don\\'t think so I don\\'t think so no your taxes are going down still further what do you say so far we haven\\'t found a form of energy that\\'s acceptable to the left we\\'re gonna have nothing who can have no jobs no energy no nothing close down every business in the country we\\'re ending decades of ruinous trade policies that cost this state one in four manufacturing jobs and the numbers are actually higher than that weak leaders and corrupt politicians sold you out they let other countries plunder our factories and steal the crown jewels of your economy past administrations finance the rise of China they had no idea what the hell they were doing on the backs of the American middle class but under this administration the great betrayal is over we are fighting for our workers our families our communities and our great American Dream we\\'re fighting for our America [Applause] we\\'re replacing the nafta catastrophe one of the worst trade deals in history with the US mexico canada agreement us mca if we could only get pelosi to do something she\\'s not doing it she sits around it should have been approved months ago that\\'s a huge win and by the way all the democrats want it everybody wants it but she doesn\\'t want to put it up for a vote she\\'s too busy doing other things it\\'s a huge win for louisiana farmers and manufacturers pelosi and the democrats need to stop their ridiculous witch hunts and past the USMC a because we have a country to run and they ought to get back to running it before my election our leaders used the great american middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects we took care of nations all over the world nations you never even heard of they decimated american manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries they used our military to defend immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money and they poured precious American blood and treasure into the middle east while our cities fell into decay and disrepair but I was elected to be President of the United States not to be President of the world [Applause] after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation we are finally putting America first and that\\'s what\\'s happening past leaders transform faraway nations into chaotic war zones then they demanded that the Americans accept unlimited migration to protect our families and block migration from some of the world\\'s most dangerous places I implemented something that some people loved some people didn\\'t like it\\'s called excuse me a travel ban and it was recently voted on very favorably in a thing called the United States Supreme Court was held totally constitutional and we are now keeping terrorists criminals and violent extremists the hell out of our country well now is you have Democrat politicians more totally betrayed you than on immigration the Radical Democrats open border agenda invites deadly drugs vicious gangs and dangerous criminals to pour into your communities your neighborhoods your state right here in Louisiana are brave ice officers have arrested criminal aliens charged or wanted for murder manslaughter sexual battery assault fraud forgery malicious bodily injury drug dealing possession of stolen weapons and child abuse all across America were finding the criminal illegal aliens and getting them out by the thousands and that includes ms-13 we\\'re getting them out by the thousands and I want to thank our Border Patrol I want to thank ice and I want to thank law enforcement they\\'re incredible we\\'ve launched historic and unprecedented action to secure our southern border we have just released brand new border numbers today showing that we have successfully reduced illegal crossings by more than 70 percent since May and I can proudly announce that we have ended catch and release and we are building the wall faster than anyone thought possible [Applause] thank you it\\'s being built it\\'s going up good and it\\'s it\\'s a big deal and I\\'ll tell you what this we had a fight for every inch we have the help of our military because it is its national security let\\'s face it it turned out it\\'s national security our message to those seeking to break our laws is very simple don\\'t try it you will fail you will be sent back home that\\'s the way it works and if you want a governor who supports that theory if you want a governor who supports what we\\'re doing on the border and supports the heroes of ice and Border Patrol you have only one choice and that\\'s to get out on Saturday and vote for any respond you ask for Democrats are becoming more and more extreme by the day their planned government takeover of health care would deny you the coverage you need and the doctor that you want my administration will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will also protect your pre-existing physicians how about that [Music] virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth and that is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption they\\'re corrupt the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and the American dream we\\'ve appointed more than 160 federal judges it\\'ll be very soon 182 including Court of Appeals judges and they will interpret the Constitution as written including our two great Supreme Court justices Neel Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and we\\'ve invested over two trillion dollars in our military your big beneficiary the state with better ships airplanes bombers tanks ammunition missiles rockets better than ever before all built in the USA I withdrew from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we have recognized Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights for years you watched as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Louisiana the next step to victory begins on Saturday your vote on Saturday is your chance to show the radical left Washington Democrats that Louisiana rejects their extremism and their corruption you will not allow your voice to be silenced you will not allow your vote to be canceled you will not allow your country to be demolished which is what would happen if they get in and you\\'ve already got a little head start because you have one lousy governor here I\\'ll tell you that\\'s why you need to get your friends get your family get your neighbors and get out to vote for Eddie you have to do it Saturday with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity together we will elect a Republican Congress we have to do that please get rid of these maniacs seized of maniacs to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful term made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic

don\\'t want to use the term Thanksgiving and that was true also with Christmas but now everybody\\'s using Christmas again remember I said that but now we\\'re gonna have to do a little work on Thanksgiving people have different ideas why it shouldn\\'t be called Thanksgiving but everybody in this room I know loves the name Thanksgiving and we\\'re not changing it but Americans have so much to be thankful for the economy is booming wages are rising crime is falling poverty is plummeting confidence is soaring and America is stronger than ever before [Applause] we\\'ve created 6.7 million new jobs including 600,000 jobs right here in the great state of Florida we\\'re protecting American workers taking care of our amazing veterans by the way you know the veterans for years and years and years I was like you I was a civilian I loved my life my life was so much simpler it was so nice and soft and easy you build a building and you have fun but I\\'d always see you turn on the news you read in the paper about our veterans being mistreated they were doing such a poor job you don\\'t hear that anymore do you you don\\'t hear it anymore our veterans for the first time are taken care of to a level that has never happened in our country before and maybe most importantly right now if the world the way it is we are rebuilding the awesome power of the United States military 2.5 trillion dollars and everything is made right here in the USA that\\'s good we make the greatest equipment in the world and a few weeks ago US Special Forces brought the world\\'s number-one terrorists to justice the bloodthirsty savage known as al-baghdadi is dead finally [Applause] and just this week I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state and you know what I\\'m talking about I had so many people say sir I don\\'t think you should do that people have to be able to fight these are great warriors they can\\'t think gee whiz if I make a mistake do I go for I mean you know what they were doing they wanted to put him in jail for 25 years one young man was in jail for seven years he had 16 more years to go and I want to tell you when you look at what they did to that man you would have been very proud at what we ended up doing he came out he hugged his parents it was a beautiful thing we gave them apart because we\\'re going to take care of our warriors and I will always stick up for our great fighters people can sit there and air-conditioned offices and complained but you know what doesn\\'t matter to me whatsoever they\\'re out of that field and they\\'re doing a job for us like nobody else anywhere in the world can do and the fact is America is winning again and America is respected again [Applause] [Applause] but while we\\'re creating jobs and killing terrorists and taking care of our borders it\\'s really setting records now you see what\\'s going on and the wall is happening it\\'s getting built rapidly and that\\'s a real wall the radical left Democrats are trying to rip our nation apart first it was the Russia hoax total hoax it was a failed overthrow attempt and the biggest fraud in the history of our country and then you look the Muller deal you remember that mess [Music] they had nothing two years they spent forty five million dollars and the real courses many times that number and now the same maniacs are pushing the deranged impeaching think of this impeachment impeachment a witch-hunt the same as before and they\\'re pushing that impeachment witch-hunt and a lot of bad things are happening to them because you see what\\'s happening in the pulse everybody said that\\'s really bullshit everybody [Applause] now the fake news back there [Applause] they\\'re gonna say the president came they will never talk about the crowd you know one of the Democrats yesterday had a rally two people showed up to two people they give us no credit if somebody has a rally like a thousand people they\\'ll say so-and-so had a rally it was packed they had a thousand people if we have a rally with 50,000 people they don\\'t talk about it [Applause] and I don\\'t know much about this stadium but I can tell you it\\'s big and you go outside and there are a lot of people outside they can\\'t get in but the lies of the Democrats are being exposed their schemes are unraveling their crimes and that\\'s what it is crimes did you ever hear this guy corrupt politician shift he made up my statement to the Ukrainian president he made it up these are crooked people but their crimes are being revealed and their citizenship lands are failing at a level that nobody thought even me possible the Radical Democrats are trying to overturn the last election because they know that they cannot win the next election is very simple you know when I started this [Applause] you know when I started this I said we\\'re gonna do this we\\'re gonna do that we\\'re gonna do that it didn\\'t mean anything you know it\\'s just like another guy trying to get elected you know they\\'re all trying so hard but it\\'s tough it\\'s not easy it\\'s not you know when a guy goes out and they want to get people nobody shows it\\'s true it\\'s not easy but when I started this no no they have it it\\'s that\\'s normal this is not normal do you think this is normal can I be honest in front of those fakers back there some of the most corrupt people in the world [Music] I will tell you in front of these guys and they\\'re fake and they\\'re corrupt but I will tell you this in front of the media let me just say this has never happened before we go out we never have an empty seat and all I say is let\\'s go to Florida just get me the biggest to read it doesn\\'t matter where let\\'s go to Wisconsin let\\'s go to Michigan let\\'s go to Pennsylvania North Carolina South Carolina let\\'s go anywhere Michigan and all I say is it doesn\\'t matter just get me the biggest Arena and we get these massive arenas like this one and they\\'re packed and we put big screens outside so people can see and it happens because there\\'s something happening in our country like has never ever been seen before in the twisted world view of the Washington very sick Democrats it was totally fine when crooked Hillary Clinton ran her outrages pay-for-play schemes out of the State Department and then she deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from Congress that was standard play but when I have a perfect phonecall I use that it\\'s a perfect call it was a perfect there was a woman today being interviewed they were talking to women who voted for Trump and they were trying to find no now they were trying to find it\\'s one of those crazy networks you know the ones I\\'m talking about and they couldn\\'t find the right door so they got these ten women and they were all for Trump but they wanted to say I voted for Trump but I won\\'t do it again they all said they said so who\\'s voting for Trump ten hands blah right no no it\\'s incredible what\\'s happening it\\'s incredible they actually said and I shouldn\\'t say this because they\\'ll bring it up but we have the greatest base in the history of politics that\\'s my opinion okay you\\'re the smartest they don\\'t like to say that about hey I went to great colleges you went to great schools and colleges you people are successful as hell they like to try and demean always by the world this and that let me tell you we\\'re winning you\\'re smarter you better look in your shopper and they call themselves a leaf but if they\\'re elite then we\\'re the super elite [Applause] they talk about these people that are elite that you know that are running I mean have you been watching these debates what\\'s elite about that guy what\\'s elite there\\'s nothing elite but we\\'re doing great we\\'re gonna have a tremendous victory but when I have a perfect call think of it 33 what they get away with and don\\'t forget I came to Washington having been there for very very few times in my life so I say look at this and I\\'m riding down Pennsylvania Avenue and I passed a hotel that I built beautiful and I said to the first lady who\\'s doing a fantastic job [Music] [Applause] so I think I might have been in Washington 17 times in my life and I\\'m riding down and I look at the first lady and I say Melania do you believe it I\\'m president look [Applause] [Music] and I I never saw so many motorcycles and I never saw so many police cars and we\\'re going so fast in the opposite direction it\\'s not supposed to go that way and I\\'m saying this is cool we could get used to this okay but I was thinking to myself when I said that I said look so I get elected and I beat the bush dynasty okay I get elected and I beat and again with no experience I didn\\'t have experience I have tremendous world experience but I didn\\'t have political experience so I get elected and we beat the Clinton dynasty right and then we beat Barack Hussein Obama and whatever the hell dynasty that is so we have 24 years of people putting people in office so we have tens of thousands of people and some of very nice but I get stuck with a lot of people that I don\\'t want tens of thousands and I\\'ll tell you we\\'re getting it right we have a great cabinet we\\'re doing things that no president has ever done before and you\\'ve got to be very very happy you\\'ve got to be very because we have done more already and hopefully we have I\\'ll say this to drive them crazy hopefully we have at least another five years to go at least because you know they think you know he\\'s not leaving don\\'t you he\\'s not leaving now we have five years than we\\'re going to make it a great five years but you know what we have done really we have done much more than I promised if you look at the tax cuts if you look at the military if you look at the VA if you look at right to try right to try how good is that right to try things that for years and years and years they\\'ve been trying to get past but when I have a perfect phone call with all of the horrible things that they\\'ve done with the president of Ukraine they tried to claim that it\\'s an impeachable offense and one of the women said this morning excuse me I\\'m voting for Trump I happened to read the transcript of his phone call and he did absolutely nothing wrong and I\\'m voting can you imagine they take this perfect call and they want to impeach your president and you know what here\\'s the good news we have more support in the Republican Party Kevin McCarthy met us I\\'m going to introduce a couple of Jim Jordan great champion wrestler he got a couple of them here I\\'m going to save them Steve Scalise who\\'s been incredible so many at least how\\'s the lease doing right new star no no it\\'s incredible Devin newness how good has he been Devin and so many more I don\\'t want to get into it but I tell you what a lot of stars are being made and I was just told backstage our poll numbers are through the roof because people don\\'t like watching a scam they don\\'t like watching it they don\\'t like watch it they\\'ve got a sick puppy shifty chef he\\'s sick if they don\\'t like seeing what\\'s happened and a lot of Democrats are saying one of them was in a today in Detroit I believe and she\\'s like in addy Democrat 30 that means but in other words that\\'s not one that we\\'re gonna work too hard to get but you never know what happens right and she came out and said essentially hey I\\'m not here to impeach the precedent but what they\\'re really saying is they don\\'t like the position they\\'re in and they\\'re gonna like it less and less and we\\'re gonna take it right up to November 3rd 2020 we\\'re gonna take back the house we\\'re gonna take it back so the president of Ukraine declared that there was no pressure put on me now he\\'s the only one that matters there was no pressure he said it all different ways there was no pressure they don\\'t even know what they\\'re talking about it\\'s a scam it\\'s a hoax the Ukrainian foreign minister stated and I quote ambassador Sandland did not tell us and certainly did not tell me about a connection between the assistance and the investigations ever told him I have never had a direct link between investigations and security assistance okay what that means you know what it means it means we did zero we did nothing wrong nothing we did nothing wrong a great senator from Wisconsin Ron Johnson a supporter of us from day one is a great guy of Ukraine he said who met privately with and he met with President Solinsky and he said at no time during that meeting was there any mention by the president you well you know what I\\'m talking about right at no time was there any mention or anything that we\\'re feeling that they were feeling any pressure in return for military aid it\\'s the craziest thing they took this look here\\'s what happened they were devastated by what happened with this Muller witch-hunt deal and then Muller testified how did he do what he testified how did he do was it too good but they were devastated they say this is a disaster now they say give us anything will impeach him let him go to the refrigerator in Pickett Orange we\\'re going to from Florida yet pick an orange from Florida we\\'re going to impeach him well a peachy but during the time period at issue the US government officials held many meetings with Ukraine and never once never did Ukraine or the officials say anything that was wrong then all of a sudden I\\'m hearing about a phone call and then fortunately they had transcribers hey how about if I didn\\'t trip with these low-lives that talk how about if we didn\\'t have it transcribed so all I\\'m saying I don\\'t want to go on it too long but all I\\'m saying is that it\\'s a terrible hoax last week söderling testified that I told him quote what do you want from Ukraine I said I want nothing there\\'s a quote I want no quid pro quo I want nothing tell President szalinski to do the right thing to do what he ran on that\\'s what he said okay and everybody knows everybody there\\'s a lot of people heard shifty make up a story where he actually made up what I said but these are the facts the case closed game over turn off the television as soon as he said that it was like turn off the television so we\\'re going to keep going I\\'ve had Republicans come up to me sir can we keep this sucker going a little bit longer we\\'ve never seen anything like it with the polls I said let\\'s get it over with but you know what we\\'re stuck with dealing with very very sick and corrupt people that\\'s what it is the failed Washington establishment is trying to stop me because I\\'m fighting for you and because we\\'re winning it\\'s very simple they\\'re attacking me because I\\'m exposing a rigged system that enriched itself at your expense and I\\'m restoring government of by and for the people [Music] and if you want to see what corruption looks like then take a look no further then slow sleepy Joe I don\\'t know what\\'s going on with young when sleepy Joe was in charge of Ukraine policy his son I call him where is he where\\'s hunter what happened doctor where\\'s hunter his son received millions and millions of dollars from a Ukrainian energy company without a great read you know the reputation of that company despite knowing absolutely nothing about energy what business are you in sir the mailbox Oh bail bond oh that\\'s us [Applause] you know hunter Biden you know sleepy Joe bail by so did you ever work on energy before you know more about energy he said now then hunter you know much more and despite being thrown out of the Navy for lots of different reasons we won\\'t even go into it he made no money zero nothing and then all of a sudden his father becomes vice-president and he\\'s making millions and millions and then he goes to China where by the way we\\'re getting very close to a very good deal and we don\\'t make it that\\'s fine but we\\'re getting very close obviously hunter is dealing with different people that I\\'m dealing with in China because after ten minutes he walked away first fund with 1.5 billion dollars I will tell you I said to everybody these are different people that I\\'m dealing with in China they got much softer that was when his father was vice president and now they\\'re finding other countries likewise I will tell you something the fake news does it want to bring it up they protect everybody the Democrats the Democrats on stage don\\'t bring it up you notice they never bring it up but if he should make it it\\'ll be brought up for about 75% of the time that with debating because nobody ever got away with a scam like that alright nobody but day after day we\\'re exposing the depravity dishonesty and sickness of the corrupt Washington establishment and let me tell you they\\'re rough they\\'re dirty players they come at you from every side they\\'re coming at me from New York they\\'re coming at me from New Jersey they\\'re coming to me from every Democratic state like nobody\\'s ever seen Rush Limbaugh said and Sean Hannity that he doesn\\'t know a man or woman in the world that could take the crap that President Trump is taking and I understand that I understand and at the same time be a great president because nobody in the first three years of a presidency has done what we\\'ve done nobody nobody that\\'s very important but with your help we\\'re going to complete the mission and we are draining the swamp indeed on Election Day 2020 the crazy Democrats are going down in a landslide and that landslide is going to start right here in the great state of Florida [Applause] thank you so here\\'s something that you just read about right we like these updated stores only don\\'t we like like something that happened a few days ago we talked who else does this most people they took in they read than the earth everybody falls asleep nobody comes they say darling how was he about somebody else hopefully oh he was so boring it was so boring and you know I always say being presidential is so easy ladies and gentlemen [Applause] but it\\'s so easy doing what I do is tough not tough for me cuz I sorta like it you gotta like it if you don\\'t love what you\\'re doing forget it it\\'s not gonna work but I do I do like it and what we\\'re doing together has never been done before never been done but I like telling these like stories that happened a little while ago they don\\'t have to put them in speeches and you read stuff and people fall asleep but on Saturday you saw what happened the White House physician called me and said sir you\\'re home today if I wanted meaning me I could do some of the physical you know in January we go for the physical I never took physicals before doubt every year supposed to think a physical but it\\'s important it\\'s good right it\\'s good because January is a very busy month for you sir I said you\\'re right so what do you want to do I said okay let\\'s go so we went to Walter Reed Medical Center fantastic place incredible dog and I was there for just a short while I visited a family of a soldier being operated on incredible family as his son was in serious condition and I stayed with them for a little while I toured the hospital he took a little part of me physical so I don\\'t have to take it in January very simple and I got back into the motorcade the car where we have many many cars and trucks and ambulances unfortunately and lots of different things right we also have like a bus or whatever the hell carries these crazy people and the press follows me wherever I go unfortunately you know the old days I could sneak out and go someplace today these people are crazy so so the press is everybody\\'s there we start it\\'s like a beautiful thing if you like lots of cars and lots of action but the press is following me so I hadn\\'t even gotten back to the White House and that stupid corrupt horrible CNN [Applause] whose ratings are terrible by the way and others and others and others whose rating by the way CNN\\'s ratings are terrible oops look their light just went off the light just went off I shouldn\\'t do it I shouldn\\'t do it cuz we lose a small audience when that happened no but they reported so Here I am [Applause] so I\\'m there for a very routine little simple physical and by the way if there\\'s something wrong I gotta tell you I want to tell you about it because it\\'s very big stuff but I was there just to save a little time in genui feel great hey let me tell you if I didn\\'t feel great I wouldn\\'t be ranting and raving - twenty-one twenty-two thousand people with lots of people outside I could judge you so I get back in and now it\\'s a short drive we arrive at the White House and I heard that they said it came out in the media including some of the very very dishonest people that are here tonight look at that it\\'s like the Academy Awards used to be used to be you know the Academy Awards was big until they started hitting us now they\\'ve gone down the tubes but it\\'s like the Academy Awards used to be look at all those lights back there but I\\'m getting it in the car and somebody said sir you okay I said yeah what\\'s that all about I go a few feet further in another security sir sir you okay sure I said yeah I\\'m fine what\\'s what\\'s going nobody\\'s ever asked me that you know normally I walk these are the greatest peoples the military the Secret Service is the greatest [Music] but they don\\'t ever say sir you okay and I could see he was like troubled he likes me you know did I walk another few feet sir I hope you\\'re okay sir I said what the hell\\'s going on and then they said I had a massive heart attack nothing to joke about but they said I had a massive heart attack I had a heart attack and it wasn\\'t true they knew it wasn\\'t true they were with me if you\\'ve had a heart attack you don\\'t leave the hospital shortly after you get there you stay in the hospital for a little while like about six weeks baby so we had the people call doesn\\'t mean anything because they\\'re totally corrupt people and they said it\\'s untrue so they brought it down from a massive unbelievable heart attack you know it\\'s very dangerous for them to do because the world believe it or not the rest of the world then the leaders like and respect your president we don\\'t want to hear this and I like that it\\'s very sad so that instead they brought it down a notch they said he went into the hospital and it\\'s true I did worth time why would I wear tie if the first thing they do is say take off your shirt sir and show us that gorgeous chest so are we want a suit we\\'ve never seen her chest quite like it now but seriously why would I put on I mean I put the tie on and then were there in 20 minutes I take it off for the physical but they said he wasn\\'t wearing your tie which is pretty unusual for me honestly I should have worn the tie maybe it\\'s not their fault but he never apologized but they said he wasn\\'t wearing a tie this is a sign of a massive heart attack but we called up and our people did a good job screaming he\\'s fine there was nothing happened they didn\\'t believe it they brought it down to tremendous chest pains he had chest pains one of them said they were tremendous or tremendous the only one that didn\\'t know it was me I\\'m the only one and then they said like a little bit later he\\'s staying over in the hospital but they knew I came back they were with me they were with me they saw me get into the car they saw us leave and they said I stayed at the great Walter Reed Hospital so we said no the chest pains aren\\'t true but they kept on reporting it we couldn\\'t get them to stop because they\\'re corrupt crooked and we don\\'t have freedom of the press we have a very dishonest we have a very dishonest [Applause] so then on Monday I flew to Texas the great state of Texas and I opened up an Apple computer plant they make the new beautiful Mac whatever I met with Tim Cook and did lots of work and it\\'s a long flight and I got back many hours later it wasn\\'t late at night and I said you know what I just said her record because yesterday or the day before they said I had a massive heart attack and now a day later I\\'m traveling to Texas to open up this big plant I don\\'t know not too many people have ever done that one before so I just want to tell you that so much as an example we had a great two weeks watching these crooked politicians not giving us due process not giving us lawyers not giving us the right to speak and destroying their witnesses it fell apart those were their witnesses we weren\\'t allowed any rights we had for the first time in the history of our country we had virtually no rights to due process and despite that we won but if you read the crooked New York Times if you read The Washington Post which is just a horrible paper you know we don\\'t have it anywhere in DC anymore we don\\'t deliver it we don\\'t give it we used to buy it we don\\'t do it and in fact I ended it in the nation because I want them to get correct news not fake this but they\\'re bad people so what happens what happens is we go out we win for the people we keep winning we won these last two weeks so solidly but if you pick up the New York Times if you pick up this crazy Washington Post you would have no idea we won but you know do it the people knew it and that\\'s why and that\\'s why they don\\'t want to have they don\\'t want to see it go on it probably will because the people are nuts and nuts and I really think probably it\\'s a good thing for us as a party because I think it\\'s going to just walk us right through that election which is going to take place already interested in it so we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders and I want to just have them run up on the stage but they\\'re stars and they\\'re warriors just like those three guys we helped out these are warriors in a different way but they\\'re up there and they\\'re fighting for your president and they\\'re fighting for your country and they love the state of Florida congressman Matt Gaetz come on up back a man I just watched last night on television he was fantastic congressman Michael walls come on up bike get up here Billy Posey a great guy and a great fighter Billy come up Gus Bilirakis guys come on up guys and a man who is an incredibly brave guy a friend of mine somebody that\\'s done a fantastic job loves his state Brian mastre Brian [Applause] [Music] I wanted to this attorney general and a friend of all of ours who ran a great campaign won easily despite a lot of crooked stuff going on with those voting machines folks a lot of bad stuff going on with us voting machines Attorney General Ashley moody come on up Ashley and by the way a friend of mine a great woman a great person former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi come up here got my pal Florida CFO Jimmy Patronus Jimmy come up and lieutenant governor and somebody that really has become a star in this state Jeanette Nunez come up tuna credible people and somebody that\\'s one of the most popular governors anywhere in the country and yeah - he better not be more popular in Florida than me I\\'m never gonna go but I\\'d sued so here\\'s a quick story wait well here\\'s a clue here\\'s a phoo but is a quick story I shouldn\\'t say cuz you know I don\\'t want to say this but what bail right so you know Ron\\'s been a friend of mine for a long time he was a congressman did an incredible job always protecting me from the Russia which hunted Bjorn with these guys with Mad and everybody he\\'d be on there and I always thought Ron was a little heavy I thought he was a little overweight that\\'s okay we all have our problems didn\\'t matter but people liked him he ran an incredible race remember I was an incredible race and then he ran against the Democrat who was supposed to be unbeatable he got beaten badly and and now this is one of the most popular governors but I always thought Ron was a little bit heavy and then one day I\\'m with him and I pat him on the shoulder and I go whoa that\\'s strong that\\'s a lot of muscle there my hand didn\\'t sink in like it does with a lot of people and did I see him without his shirt one day and this guy is strong and he\\'s not fat that\\'s all power that\\'s all muscle I want to tell you that and I said Ron you\\'ll wonder the whew I say it too don\\'t walk around with a jacket all the time take it off people are gonna see the real rod but he\\'s a great guy he\\'s a tough guy he\\'s a brilliant guy and he\\'s our governor and I\\'m very proud when we got involved with Ron a lot of people were saying do you think he can make it I said he\\'s gonna make it because he\\'s a champ is a winner and I want you to say a few words Ron thank you thank you great to be with you all and let me just say mr. president given your change of registration welcome home to Florida and why not come to Florida we have one of the lowest tax burdens of any state in the country you see some of these states that are going bankrupt we have over a five billion dollars in reserves with our budget and I see some of these cities and states with lawlessness when I came into office I was proud to sign a bill banning sanctuary cities in the state of Florida [Applause] with your support we are in the process of eliminating common core and as soon as I came into office I was able to replace on our state Supreme Court three liberal justices with three conservative constitutionally and I got to thank the president for his support of Florida I mean I\\'m you know kind of excited that he\\'s here about tell you I\\'m really excited to have Melania as a Florida resident [Music] I think in Florida were lucky to have my beautiful wife to be I think the best first lady of all the 50 states I\\'m just saying but now not only do we have Casey who does a great job but we also have Milani as a Florida resident so we\\'re really lucky in that regard in Florida but let me tell you about the president when we had a hurricane hit Northwest Florida a lot of people had forgotten about that those folks were really really in dire straits I went up to the Oval Office and even though a lot of people told them don\\'t do anything just let it go he was right there standing behind the people in Northwest Florida he has helped rejuvenate that area he saved Tyndall Air Force Base it\\'s going to come back bigger than ever very important for our military when we were trying to get Floridians access to cheaper prescription drugs we had an avenue to let people buy them in Canada because it\\'s about a third of the price a lot of times and everyone said no you can\\'t do it you can\\'t do it I went up and met with the president he said no no we\\'re doing it and so they\\'re in the process of putting that through right now [Applause] president Trump has stood with our communities in South Florida Cuban Americans Venezuelan American to stand for freedom in this hemisphere and stand against the dictatorships in places like Caracas and Havana and the president has stood where one of the most military and veteran friendly states in the country he has stood by our veterans and he has stood by our military and so our success in Florida obviously we\\'ve got a lot of great people in this state but we have a president who not only understands Florida he supports what we\\'re doing here I gotta bug him now about maybe locating the Space Command in Florida at some point I know the Air Force doesn\\'t want it but you know he makes his own decisions as we\\'ve seen so so Thank You mr. president for being a good friend to Florida and god bless you god bless Florida and god bless the United States of America thank you [Applause] [Applause] great people and I\\'ll say thanks to Republican policies we have the hottest economy anywhere in the world that it\\'s not even close unemployment has reached its lowest level in more than 51 years in the last 12 months Florida has seen the second largest payroll increase of any state in the nation people of making money african-american unemployment has again just reached its lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country [Music] Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment have also recently achieved their lowest levels at any time in the history of our country African American poverty has reached an all-time historic low wages are rising fast and blue-collar Florida workers so their wages grow nearly four point five percent in just the last 12 months people are finally starting to see for 21 years that were going backwards people would work 21 years ago when I was running so that\\'s 24 years ago people would have a tremendous problems they would make more money many many years ago decades ago then they were making 3 years ago and they\\'d have two and three jobs that\\'s not happening anymore you can go and choose your job if you don\\'t like what you\\'re doing if you don\\'t like if you\\'re not having a good time getting up in the morning all you do is find a new job and you\\'ll get more money most likely you\\'ve never been so sick you have never been successful like you\\'ve been right now never never even try and the state has never had this success and by the way you had a great governor previous to run rick Scott who\\'s now your senator he\\'s fantastic and Marco Rubio a great guy we have two great guys Marco and Rick two great guys they love this state the median income under President Bush rose $400 over an eight-year period of think of this so eight years four hundred dollars under President Obama it rose nine hundred and seventy five dollars over an eight-year period save four hundred eight years nine seventy five eight years and under trump in less than three years it rose five thousand dollars but that\\'s five thousand but now you can add to the five thousand from tax cuts regulatory cuts and energy savings you know with the number one in the world we can add another five thousand dollars so it\\'s four hundred dollars it\\'s nine seventy five eight years eight years and less than three years ten thousand dollars median okay nobody\\'s gonna beat that nobody\\'s gonna beat that and we\\'re going to keep it going we have tremendous untapped potential we ended the last administration\\'s war on American energy the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world the Democrats want to close it up I don\\'t know what they\\'re gonna use I guess little tiny windmills they don\\'t like the big ones they kill too many birds and we\\'re reversing decades of ruinous trade policies that demolished one in four and the numbers actually now greater than that when they look back Florida manufacturing jobs remember you need a magic wand you\\'re never gonna bring back that was President Obama you need a magic wand after the twin disasters of NAFTA horrible one of the worst trade deals ever made and China\\'s entrance into the WTO the World Trade Organization for years bought and paid for politicians took money from special interest to ship your jobs to other countries their campaign coffers got full and the lives of hardworking Americans were destroyed you know what happened all these companies left they left you with the jobs they left you with nothing but you having the greatest year in Florida you having the greatest year in the country that we\\'ve ever had before a doctor please dr. Mouse doctor in the house please thank you thank you very much are you okay you look like a tough guy to me I\\'ll tell you thank you a little water get him a little water or something you know the old days we used to share water today that doesn\\'t happen so much remember we share but our administration has done things that people haven\\'t seen for a long time maybe ever no more putting our country second third 20th 30th we put America first now we put it first thank you our steel towers steel mills are now firing back up across our nation they\\'re doing fantastically well including a brand-new 240 million dollar investment in Polk County good place Florida Polk County we\\'re replacing the NAFTA catastrophe if Nancy Pelosi will ever sign it and send it we\\'re waiting for months you know US embassy a u.s. Mexico Canada agreements an incredible agreement everybody wants it the Democrats want it she doesn\\'t want to give the people of our country a victory so I don\\'t know maybe she\\'ll put it all she has to do is move it forward everyone\\'s going to vote for it a lot of people but it\\'s one of the greatest deals ever and you know at a certain point Canada and Mexico they\\'ve been waiting for many months they\\'re gonna say you know what let\\'s forget about it she gotta sign it everybody wants it she\\'s got to put our country first got to put our country first because it\\'s a tremendous win for Florida farmers and all farmers for growers and ranchers from all over a country yet she and the Democrats they just have done nothing they\\'re doing nothing folks they\\'re doing nothing now it\\'s a terrible thing it\\'s a terrible thing so congresswoman for carousel power where she was she here I\\'d love to see her and congresswoman shillelagh you know that I know are wild New York they here in for you got to get Nancy to put it out congresswoman just get her to put it up Nancy\\'s on track to go down as the single worst at least productive Speaker of the House in the history of our country before my election our leaders use the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects it\\'s all over the globe remember this I\\'m President of the United States of not President of the world they decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries they used our military to defend immensely wealthy nations subsidizing their welfare states with your money they spent trillions and trillions of dollars on wars in the Middle East by the way you see what\\'s happening we\\'re winning and pulling them back and pulling them back a lot of folks reporting today they said with we are doing great you know we defeated Isis just so you understand that we defeated 100 percent of the Isis Caliphate but when we see them forming we go in and gather our military is unsurpassed but they did this while our cities at home fell into decay and disrepair we spent eight trillion dollars in the Middle East and what we want to fix a road or a highway or a school it\\'s not easy to get the money but we\\'re getting it done anyway after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation it\\'s about time we are finally putting America first past leaders transform faraway nations into blood-soaked war zones then they demanded that Americans accept unlimited migration from those same terror afflicted regions we don\\'t want to do that we don\\'t want to do that we\\'re not doing that as president I will not allow our immigration system to be used against us I will not allow political correctness to put our families in danger and our communities at risk we want to protect our people from these grave threats abroad I implemented the travel ban and I just heard today by the fake news that the travel ban failed in court but it didn\\'t it won in the Supreme Court they said it failed and they said that but you know what they meant in an earlier court it lost they didn\\'t say that it won at this room but how how\\'s that one he he they said he lost in court on the travel ban and that\\'s right in the early court and then I lost at the Appellate Division and that I won at the United States Supreme Court so we have a travel day but they didn\\'t say they didn\\'t say that they forgot to tell you the last part so we\\'re keeping terrorists we\\'re keeping criminals and violent extremists the hell out of our country we\\'re keeping them out and we\\'re doing great on the border we\\'re doing great on the border or no issue have Democrat politicians become more dangerous than immigration the Democrat Party wants open borders which is a betrayal of every mother and father who wants deadly drugs to be kept out of their community they want open borders I mean figure this one they want sanctuary cities let the criminals go in they want open borders let everybody pour into our country no matter who they are and they want one other thing higher taxes I don\\'t understand it you know all my life I grew up I\\'d be watching and I always had this great interest in politics fortunately for you but I always had this great interest and I\\'d say gee they got a lower taxes that\\'s great that\\'s like good the Democrats want to raise taxes have open borders and have sanctuary cities to me I don\\'t think that plays well what the heck do I know they want to raise your taxes and the threat is to every child whose school is under siege from these horrible gangs that they would allow in like ms-13 we have taken thousands and thousands of ms-13 gang members the hell out of our country I brought them back to where they came in the Republican Party we believe that all Americans including millions of wonderful legal immigrants are entitled to an immigration system that puts their needs first we want to come first we want to let people in you know the big door that I used to talk we want a big door but people have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit have to come in through [Applause] but thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border border patrol ice law enforcement incredible people illegal crossings are down 70% since May and the wall is going up faster than anybody ever would have thought and that wasn\\'t easy getting that wasn\\'t easy yet a whole party the Democrats would give me anything any money doesn\\'t matter billions and billions for anything except the wall even though five years ago they all wanted the wall the only reason they didn\\'t want the wall is because I wanted it and I made a terrible mistake I never admit they always say I never apologize for a mistake but I did I should have said we will not build a wall and they would have demanded that we build a wall right if I would have said we\\'re never gonna build a wall they would have said we\\'re gonna build a wall so I made a mistake what am I going what am I gonna do and we\\'re removing illegal border crossers from Central America at a pace that\\'s never been done before during my first two years in office are you okay okay doctor please doctor thank you thank you a strong thank you very much doctor thank you thank you fellas great [Applause] don\\'t forget these people are pretending like for two-and-a-half days it\\'s a lot that\\'s a lot thank you you go ahead come on back of you\\'re feeling well okay that\\'s the man I asked the question to before and he gave me a good answer you come on back what he\\'s feeling yeah go ahead fellas and you come back when you\\'re feeling better okay come back tough guy thank you that\\'s great that\\'s great thank you firefighters thank you [Applause] thank you very much what a great job there right on the ball of people amazing thank you bring him back as soon as he feels during my first two years in office Border Patrol seized 7,000 more pounds of deadly drugs than in the last two years of the Obama administration seizures of heroin were up 40 percent the far left embrace of sanctuary cities demonstrates their scorn and disdain for everyday Americans sanctuary cities have adopted a policy now of lawless anarchy aimed at innocent civilians they deliberately release dangerous criminals onto our streets out of our jails it\\'s crazy Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans not for criminal aliens in a Democrat presidential debate every single Democrat candidate raise their hand and pledge to give illegal aliens free health care courtesy of you the American taxpayer [Music] they all raise their hand I couldn\\'t believe it I will never allow Democrats in Washington to take away your healthcare and give it to illegal immigrants the Democrat Party is determined to launch a government takeover of health care that would take away your doctor eviscerate Medicare and put every single senior citizen at risk Republicans will always safeguard Medicare for our cherished seniors away we will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will protect your pre-existing physicians how about them which the Democrats are not going to be doing thanks to our tireless effort to lower the price of prescription drugs drug prices have declined in our country for the first time in more than 50 years think of that but as we\\'re working closely with your governor to bring drug prices down even more here in Florida and other states if they wanted they all wanted and it\\'s what Ron said we\\'re allowing your state to buy the identical drug oftentimes made in the same factory from other countries with the prices of 50 60 and 70 percent lower can you imagine this that\\'s because our system is all screwed up so I say go to Canada buy them and it\\'ll change watch what happens watch what happens with the drugs but I\\'m giving Florida and I\\'m giving some other states we\\'re giving Florida though the right to go and buy at a much lower price [Music] virtually every top Democrat also supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth that\\'s why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American Dream and remember this the Republican Party is the party of Abraham Lincoln we forget Abraham Lincoln and I\\'ve always heard that the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of judges I say maybe the military because without the military we\\'re not so interested in judges right so I think maybe the military but we\\'ve done a great job with that totally rebuild but we have appointed more than 160 federal judges including Court of Appeal judges to interpret the Constitution as we and will soon have a hundred and eighty two which will be a record we are strongly protecting our environment because we want America to have the cleanest air and the cleanest water anywhere on earth here in Florida just as I promised we have delivered over a half a billion dollars to fix Lake Okeechobee remember that I kept saying we\\'re gonna do it have you actually much more than 500 million dollars and we\\'ve had it fixed we fixed the Herbert Hoover dike and we restored the ecosystems in the Florida Everglades it\\'s been incredible and we did that all together they\\'ve been talking about doing it for years they didn\\'t do anything it\\'s all almost finished it\\'s finished in some cases but almost finished and all the money has been gotten a Florida I also signed legislation authorizing 100 million dollars to fight red tide and other toxic algae that damages our coastal areas and now Ron\\'s got the money that he wants so he\\'ll get it straightened out one hundred million dollars together we will preserve Florida\\'s majestic natural beauty for every generation to come that\\'s what we\\'re doing we\\'re investing over two trillion dollars think of it it\\'s gonna be up to two and a half trillion dollars in our military including nearly two hundred million dollars for military installations from Eglin Air Force Base on the Panhandle I love that Panhandle Wow remember during the election that great election night right lection night 2016 we\\'re out there remember that was that one of the greatest evenings ever and Florida was coming in sort of even we\\'re doing well little ahead of schedule we\\'re doing well and Florida was the first really big state and we\\'re going along and everything\\'s alright we\\'re pretty even with crooked Hillary and then all of a sudden we had a thing called the Panhandle it was like a rocket ship the Panhandle and we take care of the Panhandle we love the paddle we also spent a lot of money on MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa a lot in Panama City we\\'re building big beautiful ships for our incredible Coast Guard what they\\'ve done for your hurricanes and in the case of Texas Puerto Rico this state will also be playing a critical role in the 6th branch of the u.s. military the space force the Democrats are trying to stop it they\\'re trying to stop it but I think we\\'re a pretty good shape we need it that\\'s the new frontier you look at China you look at Russia you look at some of these countries it\\'s about space we have to have it we\\'re behind it we don\\'t want to be behind we\\'ll never be behind again like that space force Brendan I would through from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal I recognize Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we have recognized Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights they\\'ve been trying to get that done for 54 they\\'ve been working on Jerusalem and the embassy in the capital for many many presidents everybody said we\\'re gonna do it during the campaign we\\'re gonna do it we\\'re gonna do it never got done in fact we have a man with us tonight the ambassador to Israel ambassador David Friedman wizz David did I do a good job for Israel David great ambassador great success story here in the Western Hemisphere we are confronting the brutal menace of communism and socialism we are proudly supporting the great people of Venezuela Cuba and Nicaragua and their righteous struggle for freedom you know that and to those who would try to impose the horrors of socialism on our country I say again tonight America will never be a socialist country ever [Applause] this election is a choice between turning back to the path of American decline we were declining we were not respected I can tell you that we were not respected everybody took advantage of our country and you see what\\'s happening we were for sale this gentleman just said we were for sale we\\'re not for sale anymore but now we\\'re continuing forward to a future of American strength and Donna means if you look at the dominance look at what we\\'re doing nobody ever thought they were going to see this an American prosperity it\\'s a choice between whether our country will be ruled by the corrupt politicians and bureaucrats and you\\'ve been watching you know what I\\'m talking about you think it\\'s easy they\\'ve been entrenched for a long time some very bad some very bad people or whether we will be ruled by the American people for years and years you watched as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the incredible people of Florida thank you very much with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration they don\\'t want to approve loopholes they don\\'t want to approve anything they want people to pour into our country and many of those people are very bad people with the help of our governor and our great congressmen and senators we will fight to give school choice to every child in America who needs it we will enact trade deals that come along right we just finished our big deal with Japan we just did our deal with South Korea that was so bad those deals and we made them into great deals fair deals and if they don\\'t want to make the deals I say that\\'s okay which is good a tariff your product that pours into our country like they do to us but we are enacting trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within ten years can you believe it we can do that we now have the science to go and it could have been started before my administration but they didn\\'t do that but I did it think of that who would have thought that was possible when they told me about that a year and a half ago I said I didn\\'t know that and the doctors came in they said no that\\'s what we can do we\\'re gonna end the AIDS epidemic within ten years think of that we will chart a new era of discovery in space and someday soon we will land an American astronaut on the surface of that\\'s what we\\'re shooting NASA is doing a great job and we have some private rich guys they love rocket ships so we say go ahead Elon we said go ahead Elon play your games go ahead you can use our property just pay us some nice rents please we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms [Applause] and above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful country as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true American Way we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag and we will always live by the words and nobody will take those words away like they try to do with so many things nobody of our national motto In God We Trust nobody\\'s taking away we stand on the shoulders of American patriots who cross the oceans

this state it gave us the Liberty Bell Pennsylvania Steel Hershey chocolate I like Hershey chocolate the knitly Lions you know the Nittany Lion they\\'re doing pretty well too and the incredible American patriots just like you you are patriots thank you very much thank you under Republican leadership America is stronger than ever before and we are respected again last month you saw it we smashed expectations with another 266 thousand jobs and unemployment is now more than a 50-year low we have never seen what\\'s going on with different groups unemployment is at a position we\\'ve never had anything like this you\\'re so lucky I became your president I\\'m only kidding I have to say I\\'m kidding because the fake news back there we\\'ll take that [Applause] they\\'ll take that statement and they\\'ll blow it up and they\\'ll say he said they were lucky to have him as president what a horrible thing to say because they\\'re fake anyway anyway here in Pennsylvania you had the single best year that you\\'ve ever had in the history of our country not bad the Pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all-time record low and I hate to tell you this you know when I was campaigning three-and-a-half years ago I\\'d come here you weren\\'t doing so well folks right you weren\\'t doing so well wages were way down unemployment was way up it wasn\\'t a pretty picture just a few months ago I visited the new shale petrochemical plant in Beaver County at six billion dollars with the be six billion dollars it is the largest investment in Pennsylvania history we\\'re ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state for generations American manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy the bedrug remember less administration you need a magic wand it\\'ll never come back your data back we found the magic wand didn\\'t we then came after that after disaster I call it one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs your politicians always pledged to fix it they talked about it for years and years of decades but they never were able to do it they came and they went to Washington and they did nothing but unlike those politicians I keep my promises and I love Pennsylvania you know I went to school in Pennsylvania you know I know it well and I\\'m thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the NAFTA catastrophe once and for all Congress will suit vote on my new trade deal the u.s. Mexico Canada agreement or u.s. MCA after years of Wayne many many years many many decades they\\'ve been looking for this and then we got it done and we\\'ve been waiting for a long time for Nancy Pelosi to announce us MCA and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th President of the United States and your favorite president I think and the reason they announced it on the same day one hour later they announced impeachment a few guys standing behind her they announced her Pietschmann and then an hour later she announced that she\\'s going to do USMC a you know why it\\'s a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they\\'re embarrassed by the impeachment and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid and peaceful and think of it this way also the silver lining of impeachment and this witch-hunt that\\'s the reason they approved us mca so that\\'s okay with me because they approved it and they\\'re very happy to have it but honestly it\\'s an incredible deal for our country took too long it waited in congress for too long a time incredible deal and replacing the worst nafta we\\'ve also just reached a deal with Congress to invest a record 738 billion dollars more into our great military [Applause] when I took over I will tell you I became president think of it almost three years ago by the way what is that the most exciting night ever you know I\\'m just watching these people that was one of the greatest evenings in the history of television from a rating standpoint from an excitement standpoint what the hell would they do without me and you they\\'d be gone you know about a month before I ran I picked up a New York Times it was like a leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store and now it\\'s thick they\\'ve got all their reporters covering Trump Trump Trump I can\\'t imagine they won\\'t endorse because without me winning you know what happens they all go down the tubes they\\'re God all of them why she did bounce do your time those very dishonest networks they have very dishonest very very well they\\'re very dishonest people and I have to say this look it I always have to say this you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications but not too many of them I have to be honest with you the legislature well you know that does anybody think the media is honest does anybody think they\\'re totally corrupt and dishonest all right the legislation will also officially establish something that\\'s so important to me because it\\'s where it\\'s at and a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall which we\\'re building you know the wall is going on it gets one of the biggest applause of anything it\\'s the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces the space force we\\'re opening up the space force because you know what that\\'s where it\\'s at and everything is built right here in the United States that\\'s important and by the way we build the greatest weapons the greatest plays the greatest ships to grant we build it in the United States there\\'s nobody that comes close we have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world rockets and missiles no place builds it like us we have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the United States we\\'ve never had a thing like this we are so hot we are so and just a few weeks ago the United States Special Forces brought the world\\'s number one terrorists to justice thanks to the strength and courage of our warriors and they are great warriors the bloodthirsty savage known as al-baghdadi is now dead [Applause] and he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead and we\\'ve got our ion in our sights on third also we know exactly where and when but you know it\\'s becoming a very unpopular job not a lot of takers in that\\'s what we want go back to living a good normal life because America is winning again America is winning again like never before and as I always say and I\\'ve already said it twice tonight this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago we will laugh but while we\\'re delivering historic victories for the American people the radical left Democrats and the failed Washington establishment are trying to erase your votes nullify the election and overthrow our democracy not gonna happen don\\'t worry about it I wouldn\\'t lose too much sleep over it and I have to say this about the Republicans the Republicans and you have a lot of great ones here tonight your Congressman you have a lot of great ones these congressmen a great the Republicans have never been so United as they are right now ever the house the Senate we\\'ve never been this United because it\\'s all a hoax and they understand it they also understand poll numbers but I\\'m sure that had nothing to do with it but the impeachment hoax is about overturning your great 2016 vote or in the alternative trying to win the 2020 election that\\'s not going to happen yesterday the Justice Department\\'s inspector general released a report detailing the outrages scandalous and unprecedented abuses of power [Applause] get her out [Applause] get her out get around see these guys want to be so politically correct you get her out [Applause] you see that I\\'ll tell you law enforcement so great that particular guy wanted to be so politically correct all oh we don\\'t want to be politically correct I don\\'t know who he was he didn\\'t do the greatest job so they tried to frame innocent people in the ludicrous it all started with the Russia witch-hunt right then the Inspector General shocking report proved that the Obama FBI obtained secret warrants to spy on my campaign based on a phony foreign dossier of the bump smears paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC the FBI failed to disclose the nature of the political hit chopped to the FISA Court they hit it they deceived it and they lied the dossier was written by a discredited foreign agent who quote desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the United States president what says they see folks they spied on our campaign okay they spy never happened before in the history of our country and we\\'re really wise to it we\\'re wise to it the Inspector General found that the FBI spying application contains 17 errors and omissions commonly known as lies and deceit when the FBI and you have great people in the FBI but not at leadership you have not good people in leadership you haven\\'t had when the FBI uncovered evidence showing that we did absolutely nothing wrong which was right at the beginning they hit that exonerating you know that they hit it they hit it so nobody could see it so they could keep this hoax going on for two years they knew right at the beginning that it was all a frame-up a setup but they hid it so that nobody could see it so they could keep it going on thinking they were going to hurt us politically but now we\\'re stronger politically than we were ever before and the FBI also sent multiple undercover human spies to surveil and record people associated with our campaign look how they\\'ve hurt people they\\'ve destroyed the lives of people that were great people that is still great people their lives have been destroyed by scum okay by scum an FBI lawyer forged took a female forged forged an email used as evidence an act which is now the subject of a criminal referral okay what they did is so unbelievable oh I look forward I don\\'t know I don\\'t know I keep away I look forward to bull Durham\\'s report that\\'s the one I look for and this report was great by the IG especially since he was appointed by President Barack Hussein Obama considering that fact it was great because we learned a lot of things that nobody would have found out very easily although I suspect we would have we also know from a previous inspector general investigation that many of these same high-ranking officials were consumed with anti-trump and anti-trump people hatred and bias texting about and insurance policy let\\'s have an insurance but remember remember Peter struck and his lover Lisa Paige remember Lisa I love you so much Lisa please Lisa please least I\\'ve never loved anyone like you we won\\'t allow this to happen to our fun Lisa please some of you love me Lisa I love you Peter I love you I love you like I\\'ve never loved anyone and if for any reason if for any reason she loses even though she\\'s a stone-cold corrupt person if for any reason she loses Peter we\\'ve got to have an insurance policy we have to do it because we\\'re gonna go and that\\'s what\\'s been happening for the last two-and-a-half years okay it was their phony insurance policy so FBI lawyer Lisa Paige so in love that she didn\\'t know what the hell was happening texted the head of counterintelligence Peter struck likewise so in love he couldn\\'t see straight this poor guy did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing to keep him away from Lisa that\\'s what I heard I don\\'t know if it\\'s true the fake news will never report it but it could be true no that\\'s what I heard I don\\'t know I mean who could believe a thing like that no I heard that Peter stock needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover ah at least I hope you miss him Lisa he\\'ll never be the same but he said he\\'s not ever going to become president and struck look back no no he won\\'t we\\'ll stop it we\\'ll stop it can you believe we found these texts can you believe this is FBI agents at a high level no no we\\'ll stop it they\\'re gonna stop us from winning an election and then we have to listen there was no bias so there was nobody think of these people they right there was no bias and yet he\\'s saying no no darling we\\'ll stop it and then they announced there was no Buy\\'s now you know what we\\'re doing and it\\'s not easy and somebody said a regular president I don\\'t want to use the word normal because that\\'s not a nice normal refer a regular president would have been under a table thumb in the mouth saying take me home mommy this is do tough for me true they know and while it was tough on my family I have to say very unfair to my family very tough on my family I have a great family tough for me it\\'s my life I do it I do it it\\'s one thing but very tough and a family thing like this happens it\\'s a disgrace but day after day we\\'re exposing something called that filthy disgusting horrible swamp and we\\'re cleaning it up and now after two and a half years now that the Russia witch-hunt is dead a big fat disgusting fraud the congressional Democrats are pushing the impeachment which aren\\'t having to do with Ukraine but that\\'s already failing you saw their so-called articles of impeachment today people are saying they\\'re not even a crime what happened all of these horrible things remember bribery and this and that occur where are they they send these two things that not even a crime this is the lightest weakest impeachment you know our country said actually many a pizza do you call judges and lots of a many impeachment but it was on today everybody said fiza\\'s impeachment light this is the lightest impeachment in the history of our country by far it\\'s not even like an impeachment these people are stone cold crooked when a guy like shifty shift here\\'s a corrupt politician he made up my statement because see I did one thing very good as soon as I heard about this deal I released my statement immediately but he had already made horrible statements and by the way the whistleblower the whistleblower defrauded our country because the whistleblower wrote something that was totally untrue and we broke up the game remember the second whistleblower was coming right and then the informer who is the informer I know the informer is the informer so the informer obviously gave him false information because they wrote in the whistleblower report right they wrote something totally different from what I said what I said was perfect but it screwed up the whole works because most guys would never do that they didn\\'t even know probably that we had it transcribed professionally transcribed word-for-word transcribed so beautiful am i lucky I had it transcribed think of that so what I said release it and I don\\'t like doing that because you\\'re releasing it it\\'s a conversation with the foreign leader in this case a very fine gentleman president of Ukraine the new president of Ukraine and we call them up and we said would it be okay our Secretary of State made the call would it be okay and they didn\\'t know what we were talking about but they said yeah it\\'s okay and by the way he his foreign minister everybody did you know they said there was no pressure he didn\\'t do anything wrong there was no pressure put on us that didn\\'t stop anybody but we released the conversation and that gummed it up now all of a sudden we never heard from the second whistleblower we never heard about who the informer was the whistleblower who\\'s going to come out strong he\\'s disappeared where\\'s the whistleblowing he\\'s disappeared he\\'s gone maybe our great congressman can find him okay but the whistleblower is gone he flew the coop because he reported incorrectly and the IG who didn\\'t want to look at the conversation he was so anxious to turn the whistleblower report over to Congress so that Congress could have fun with it or to be ashamed of himself but today the House Democrats announced these two flimsy pathetic ridiculous articles of impeachment the House Democrats are walking back from everything they claimed with today\\'s announcement they\\'re now admitting there was no collusion there was no obstruction of justice and there were no crimes whatsoever there are no crimes it says it there are no crimes they\\'re impeaching me and there are no crimes this has to be a first in history they\\'re impeaching me you know why because they want to win an election and that\\'s the only way they can do so the Democrats have nothing and they\\'ve turned the samba process of impeachment and it was you know to me impeachment is a very ugly word it\\'s a word I associate with some very bad times in our country the good news is we\\'re having the best times in history in our country okay but the word of Pietschmann to me is a very very ugly word it\\'s a dark ugly word but but I have to tell you as bad it is is it meant something when you had serious high crimes and misdemeanors when you had serious but it\\'s impeachment that would happen every 50 years every 40 years every hundred years this was a big deal then making it so like let\\'s do it every every six months they\\'ve cheapened the process they\\'ve cheapened the process these people are so bad the radical left Democrats and I actually think that Pelosi who by the way by the way by the way she has totally lost control she is totally it\\'s being run now by this crazy AOC +3 AOC +3 now it\\'s being run by other people the far left has just grabbed that party it is so sad to see and she knew what would happen I didn\\'t because I didn\\'t figure the poles would go through the roof they went out today in Michigan in Wisconsin in a place called Pennsylvania no no the poles are through the roof that calls swing states very important states we won Pennsylvania the last time and we\\'re going to win it again but even bigger our polls have gone over the last month they\\'ve gone through the roof you look at it take a look at it it came out today the firehouse polled the firehouse Paul it\\'s an important poll it was always good and never looked at it today I like it a lot we\\'re up through nobody can even believe it so what Pelosi did and as I said they do the impeachment then right away let\\'s do us MCA right on top of it you think she\\'d wait like a day she wanted to smother the impeachment crap and that\\'s probably what she did at least to an extent but any Democrat that votes for this sham will be voting to sacrifice the House Majority their dignity and their career and some of these partisan lunatics have already said that if they fail this time think of this how about low IQ Maxine Waters how about green how about green we Breen how about green where he said we have to impeach him because if we\\'re on a beach him we\\'re not gonna win the election this is what we this is what we\\'re dealing with you know we\\'re dealing with some very bad people we\\'re dealing with people that don\\'t respect you and by the way you know they talk about the elite you\\'re the elite they\\'re not really you\\'re the elite you got better education you got better you got better everything you\\'re the elite it always bothers me they said the elite this is the elite look at these people how beautiful this is the only you know who is the elite you look at those jobs reports we\\'re the best in history unemployment for african-americans best in history unemployment hispanic-americans best in history unemployment asian-americans near the elite here the elite but they said they\\'ll do it again because this has been a total bust they\\'ll do it again and by the way the Senate\\'s been so professional so good so strong so solid just like these gentlemen in the house so solid so we have to vote these crazy people the hell out of office and in 2020 I\\'m gonna work like hell that we take over the house we have to take over the house right gotta take over the house Mike so here are the facts that shifty shift is that guy the worst he comes up to a microphone now he comes up to a microphone like two and a half years ago I have absolute proof that the personhood of the United States transpired with Russia Russia what the hell do I have to do with Russia by the way Russia wishes that Hillary Clinton won but they wish we are now number one in the world that energy Russia\\'s number three we\\'re beating now Russia and Saudi Arabia you\\'d have windmills all over the place if you had cricket Hillary they\\'d be knocking out those birds left and right those windmills wah-wah-wah darling I want to watch television tonight and there\\'s no damn wind what a way to I want to watch the election results darling there\\'s no wind the damn wind just isn\\'t blowing like it used to because of global warming I think I think it\\'s global Global one no more win no more life the oceans gonna rise 1/8 of an inch within the next 250 years we\\'re gonna be wiped out look I want clean air I want clean water crystal clean I want and that\\'s what we have at a record level our air and our water are cleaner now than it\\'s ever been okay with all that we\\'re doing it and we haven\\'t closed up all of our industry and we haven\\'t closed up our businesses that lost all those jobs and right now we\\'re by far the largest economy in the world and if you remember you could look if you go back five six seven years in 2019 they say China was going to catch us as the world\\'s largest economy guess what they\\'re way behind they\\'re waving because over the last three years you see the stock market set a hundred and thirty one records from that I think of that and that means jobs that means 401ks I have so many people that come up to me thank you sir my wife is so in love with me because I I went up 79% in the 401k she thinks I\\'m a genius she always thought I was a total stiff a dumb stupid dope now she thinks I\\'m a financial genius sir and all I did was buy some stock I have stock in a 401k and you made me into a genius sir she loves me so much more than she ever did shows you the power of money right did that terrible but I have so many people 401ks are through the roof you jobs are through the roof we have the lowest unemployment rate and now more importantly than anything wages are up for the first time in many many years decades decade you remember four years ago I was here and I told people I said you know 20 years ago people made more money than they made four years ago not now not anymore because people now can not only make a lot more money if they don\\'t like their job they go out and they get a different job and they get more money and ultimately they do find one that they love you have so many opportunities right now wages are up jobs are up and today we set a new record almost 160 million people are working we\\'ve never come close to that number that\\'s a hell of a number but just quickly here are the facts on shifty ship this honest guy makes up by staples he said the president of Ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure but he didn\\'t want to say that we said say it say it you crooked bastard say but he doesn\\'t want to say it we said saying that I\\'d like to force him to say it he\\'ll walk up to the mic what years of journalism guy\\'s a total corrupt guy listen just to finish off a man who I really I don\\'t know him but I respect him because the Ukrainian foreign minister and he said it so strongly I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance he just said that the Democrats who are corrupt refused to say that and that\\'s ultimately the only one that matters the leaders of Ukraine because they\\'re the ones that know of this pressure not some crooked ambassador that\\'s a deep stater or that\\'s a bushy or that\\'s a Clint tonight or that\\'s a Barack Obama ambassador okay the ones that matter are the leadership of the country that we\\'re talking about they refuse to say it because they\\'re dishonest people there\\'s only one way to stop the rabid partisan Democrats Pennsylvania voters must show up in 2020 so we can take back the house hold the Senate and keep the White House only way okay so I\\'m gonna ask these people to come up on the stage because we have warriors with us tonight we love warriors like the guys that killed our back daddy you know how much press you know how much press I got I don\\'t care about press but code and the dog he\\'s got more than I did and that\\'s okay don\\'t and was almost electrocuted he deserves it they gave me about a day and that\\'s okay because the people understand we made a great decision I remember this al-baghdadi was the founder of Isis al Baghdadi was a vicious ruthless person al Baghdady created a Caliphate bigger than the state of Ohio think of that that\\'s a big Caliphate and we now have taken 100% of the Caliphate and we have thousands and thousands of Isis prisoners and with Obama you did nothing you did nothing but get your ass kicked all right we\\'re joined tonight by many of the terrific warriors that have helped me so much in so many ways they fight for us they really are incredible and they come right from the state of Pennsylvania Haidee epidote is where Biden keeps saying he\\'s in the wrong state like if he\\'s in Ohio it\\'s great to be in Iowa tonight if he\\'s in Pennsylvania it\\'s wonderful to be in the state of Delaware what is wrong with this guy what\\'s wrong with him there\\'s something wrong okay there\\'s something wrong no he keeps how many times can you do that so far it could happen cuz you know I was doing six and seven a day that last month that last beautiful month that I loved I was doing six I left these guys alone I didn\\'t want to do interviews they\\'re all a waste of time we just did these big beautiful rallies I was doing and you know if you start getting a little you know I went to Michigan then I went to Wisconsin then and when I\\'m saying is saying you know like what the hell is going on these crowds are incredible and we had the biggest class by the way to this day there has never been and they\\'ll always correct me in the history of politics in the history of our country there has never been anybody that drew crowds like we draw and I don\\'t have a guitar I have no Katara this is never how I mean if you took Ronald Reagan and we all like Ronald Reagan I liked him I thought he was a great guy but if he came to Pennsylvania for a rally you know if he had a thousand people in a ballroom or something you know I mean we\\'re getting crowds twenty-five thirty thousand people and then there\\'ll be twenty thousand people outside you know we setup screens outside and if anybody would like to stand in the rain watching and do you people out there I\\'m sorry it\\'s pretty rough but no there\\'s never been anything like it one instruction get me the biggest arena you can get we we don\\'t have empty seats I mean look at this how many how many seats is this eleven thousand how much ten thousand five hundred it\\'s packed it\\'s beyond that and don\\'t forget look at the floor and then you go out now and then you go out and you look outside and you have thousands and thousands because there\\'s a spirit for what we\\'re doing we\\'re fixing our country we\\'re healing our country we\\'re making America great again so I want to ask a couple of our great warriors to come forward representative Glenn Thompson come up here to come up with a man that\\'s been a friend of mine for a long time Mike Kelly don\\'t get in a fight with my come up mother a wonderful man who represents this area Scott Perry representative Lloyd Schmucker Lloyd a guy who was always there for us John Joyce and two people that you all know very well in this state they bring home the bacon dan Muser and Fred Keller I want to also bring back our Pennsylvania Party Chairman and I\\'ve know his grandfather I shouldn\\'t say that to you he was a tremendous man dan Tabas but I\\'m going to introduce somebody that Dan always said had tremendous talent a little bit alike I know that he\\'d be working with us and he\\'s really working well he\\'s smart he\\'s tough Lawrence Tabas come on up [Applause] also with us tonight Pennsylvania Trump victory chairwoman Bernie you know this right you know this person comfort you know do you know who that is you know that is everybody knows who that national committeeman Bob Asher RNC co-chairman Tommy Hicks has been incredible and my friend David Urban David so I just want to thank this is an amazing group of people and with their help and the help of everyone here we are going to set records like we\\'ve never set before you know I used to say and I sort of still have to say 2016 I don\\'t know if anything like that can ever happen but I think we\\'re much better you know all of the things I said we\\'re going to cut taxes we\\'re going to cut regulations we\\'re going to take care of our vets look what we did for events with choice right look what we did look what we did we now have the ability to fire all of the bad people that are in the VA right Fayette over 8,000 people that were disrespecting our that\\'s they wouldn\\'t have done it in primetime I can tell you that but what we\\'ve done for our vets what we\\'ve done in rebuilding our military what we\\'ve done in so many ways and we unlike the Democrats will protect your Second Amendment okay so we\\'ve done a job and we\\'re proud of it and we have tremendous people and let\\'s give them a hand and thank you very much [Applause] thank you thank you everybody thank you thank you folks vote for these people even if you don\\'t like them vote for them oh that\\'s a beautiful new hat look at the hack that guy\\'s got a how\\'s that hot working out is that that good I love that hat look at this guy that says Keep America great should we do the poll should we do a poll they\\'re ready so we have the greatest phrase in the history of politics make America great again and we wait and we have our new phrase because we\\'ve made America great I told you stock market we\\'ve rebuilt our military we\\'ve cut your taxes like at a level that nobody could even think possible you look at your median take a look at your median income take a look at what\\'s happened the numbers median household income take a look at your numbers with President Bush it went up four hundred dollars in eight years with President Obama it went up nine hundred and seventy-five dollars in eight years with President Trump it went up five thousand but whoa whoa whoa in less than three years that\\'s a big thing way and then when you add energy savings and you add tax savings you have almost a $10,000 game [Applause] and that\\'s one of the very big reasons why our I think that and regulations but that\\'s one of the very big reasons why our economies do so because they talk about our consumer is loaded with money thank you very much mr. president I appreciate it but with the help of everyone here we have now the hottest economy you know when I meet dictators and presidents and kings and queens and prime ministers they all come into that beautiful Oval Office so beautiful right so respected and the first thing they almost always say sir congratulations on your economy we\\'re trying to do the same thing I said you won\\'t be able to do it yeah they won\\'t be able to let them give it a shot but they all say congratulations on the great job you\\'ve done with the economy but we\\'ve all done the great job not me we\\'ve all done I\\'ve been your spokesman and I\\'ve done a good job as spokesman but they all say that but we\\'ve done a good job in many ways you know all of the promises that I made I\\'m the only politician of the history that I\\'ve actually kept more promises than I made think of that the other words I made here like a thing like right to try nobody talked about right to try we got right to try that somebody terminally ill we have the greatest medicines in the world the greatest doctors the greatest labs in the world nobody close but it takes years to get it approved and I got it approved so you can sign a document get it and if you want to see the lives that we\\'re saving it\\'s a beautiful thing a beautiful thing is happening right to try right but we\\'ve also created 7 million new jobs since the election if I would have said that the fake news would have gone crazy they would have said that\\'s impossible fakes people would have gone crazy they go crazy anyway and I don\\'t even say it and right here in Pennsylvania we\\'ve created 160,000 brand-new beautiful jobs and you have companies moving in and moving back and as I said African American Hispanic American Asian American unemployment the lowest ever in the history of our country the lowest unemployment rates wages for low-income workers have gone up more than 10 percent nobody thought that was possible they\\'re one of the biggest in terms of a group one of the biggest beneficiaries this year 40 million American families will benefit from the Republican child tax credit each receiving an average of $2,200 we ended the last administration\\'s war on American energy the United States is now and I said it and I\\'ll say it all night long number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world and there\\'s nobody even close and in the state of Pennsylvania natural gas production is up 34 percent since our election 34 virtually every leading Democrat has pledged to entirely eliminate American production of oil clean coal natural gas I don\\'t think somebody coming into Pennsylvania you know those new petrochemical plants they don\\'t like them at all thousands and thousands of jobs incredible millions of dollars in taxes how about going to the state of Texas we had one candidate who turned out not to be too good a candidate right bado bado remember so he wanted to get rid of religion the Bible he wanted to get rid of guns and he wanted to get rid of oil how about going to Texas and say no Bible no oil think of this one no Bible no oil no guns I think you could be Abraham Lincoln and not win that particular race and it wouldn\\'t be much different in the state of Pennsylvania that I can tell you but you know somebody that believes in that is sleepy Joe Biden he was caught telling a far-left radical activist that he would shut down fossil fuel production in Pennsylvania you saw that but the voters of this Commonwealth will never ever let that happen can you imagine a guy coming in whether it\\'s him or anybody else they all want to do it he just raises his head he has no clue what he\\'s doing there is the head remember look you want to give illegal aliens health care even though we\\'re taking it away from our own soldiers that are up and he looks and they\\'re all raising their hand did you see that well you know oh oh okay I\\'ll do it too in addition to replacing NAFTA I\\'ve taken the toughest ever action against China\\'s trade abuses they want to make a deal so bad and we\\'re doing well with the deal but they want to make a deal please make a deal we don\\'t want to pay tariffs any more please please thanks to our steel tariffs steel mills in Pennsylvania are roaring back to life and US Steel has just announced a 1 billion dollar investment in Mon Valley works in Pittsburgh you know that right 1 billion dollars they weren\\'t investing they were divesting the steel companies one of a certain amazing achievement we tax all of the dumped steel comes in from China and other places 25% all of it all of a sudden our steel mills are doing again and we need steel you know it\\'s not like you could say gee we\\'ll get it from another country we need that for defense we needed for our ships we needed for our planes we needed we can\\'t play games with steel after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation and very importantly in everything we do we are putting America first sorry we gave up in the globalists folks you know let\\'s build the world let\\'s forget about our country let\\'s just rebuild the world or no is you have the Democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the American people then on the issue of immigration far let politician I mean they\\'re fighting me on the wall you have no idea but we\\'re building it and is fine and we have the money coming in from the military I got three Amir from there from there believe me if I weren\\'t a good developer you could forget about that wall I got here they\\'re the Roomba these people fought me and we\\'ve started winning in court and you know what speaking of court we will soon have 182 federal judges including Court of Appeals nobody can believe oh because Barack Obama gave us a hundred and forty-two empty seats you know when you\\'re a president they always say I disagree I think the most important thing we can do is defense right but beyond defense they always say the most important thing you can do is judges and justices of the Supreme Court we have two great ones great words but they always say judges and Supreme Court justices and when you leave office I hope in five years nine years 13 years 17 twenty-one years 25 years 29 years when I leave office now I\\'m only doing that to drive them totally crazy that drives them crazy even joking about it we have this idiot comedian who stands up he\\'s talking to a guest right he said you know he\\'s going to win don\\'t you you know takers don\\'t know whether to fight we\\'re gonna fight and they will no no no you know he\\'s going to win then he goes you know he\\'s going to win and you know he\\'s never leaving don\\'t you he\\'s never leaving and at first I thought he was kidding he\\'s a whack job he is totally serious he honestly believes in I don\\'t understand we give it a shot baby we\\'ll give this Holika Holika media I\\'m only kidding they won\\'t write that but that\\'s okay they won\\'t write the I\\'m only kidding one but far let politicians support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their sneering contempt scored and disdain for everyday Americans these jurisdictions deliberately release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to offend where they are free to kill where they are free to rape where they are free to beat up people except for ice because ice is what suffer than that they don\\'t beat up on they don\\'t beat up ice you\\'re lucky we have ice they want to put ice out of business that\\'s not happening Isis there are incredible people they\\'re great patriots and they\\'re tough thanks to Democrat immigration policies innocent Americans in all 50 states are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals last summer at least 19 illegal aliens were charged in connection with grisly homicides including hacking victims to death and ripping out in two cases their hearts weeks ago two illegal aliens and members of the savage gang ms-13 who we are removing from our country by the thousands were charged with relentlessly beating a wonderful beautiful high school teenager to death with a baseball bat and chopping the body apart with a machete one of the animals accused was previously released by local authorities in defiance of a nice demand I Swan and said you can\\'t let him go they wanted him they would do anything for him they wanted them to hand this animal over for deportation back to his country get him the hell out of our country right Democrat sanctuary cities also give safe haven to those who commit violent sex crimes since Montgomery County Maryland declared itself a sanctuary jurisdiction in July we have already identified nine illegal aliens who have been arrested for rape sexual assault including a 26 year-old man charged with raping and viciously strangling a young wonderful woman who was entering her apartment innocently entering her apartment she was raped and killed strangled to death sanctuary City Maryland but these are only the cases we know about sanctuary cities and jails actively conceal illegal alien crime and criminals from federal government federal government wants to take them out or in some cases if it\\'s real violence and we don\\'t want to pay for the cost but we do put them into very strong jails the sanctuary city of Philadelphia a sanctuary City and Philadelphia is one of the very worst sanctuaries anywhere in America did you know that I mean I know Philadelphia well going to school here we never heard about sexual cities did we weeks ago an illegal alien charged with rape sexual assault of a child and inflicting serious bodily injury was released by Philadelphia - Wanda free in your communities and by the way you may have the worst district attorney or whatever the hell you come this guy I\\'ve been hearing about this guy he lets killers out almost immediately what the hell how did you let that happen instead of handing him over while still in jail they defied ice they fought with ice and set him loose upon an unsuspecting family thankfully at great time and effort our brave ice officers were eventually able to track him down arrest him detain him and do what has to be done how they how do you elect Democrats when they create a sanctuary city of Philadelphia I don\\'t get it for ms-13 gang members were also arrested in Pennsylvania in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of a 21 year old and a 15 year old as we speak a criminal illegal alien with three prior deportations is roaming free in Pennsylvania because he was released by the city of Philadelphia the City of Brotherly Love you better get yourself a new prosecutor in this place I want to tell you that\\'s a horrible thing no it\\'s a national story how he wants everybody to not pay the price and you\\'re talking about not paying the price for rape for murder for other horrible crimes how stupid how stupid can you be the charges against this Elliot include rape aggravated indecent assault unlawful contact with a minor indecent exposure and terroristic threats other than that he was a very nice person Philadelphia\\'s defied ice and released illegals charged with everything from assault to kidnapping to drug crimes to sex crimes to homicide murder Democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos Republicans stand for law and order and we stand for justice we stand for justice we side with law enforcement and with law-abiding Americans not ruthless gang members and not violent criminals aliens that come into our country illegally they take our payments payments some of these people with these crazy laws that you have look at what\\'s going on in California they do better than our great veterans they do better than citizens of our country and they advertise we will take you we will take care of you we will pay for it and then you wonder why we have so many people trying to come through with the borders but we do a great job we\\'re removing these criminal illegal aliens from our country by the thousands we\\'re sending them home and we\\'re not letting them come back in with being very tough and Mexico is now giving us 27,000 soldiers at our border and Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador we signed a very important agreement with each when their people come into our country they weren\\'t taking them back now they take them back and they say thank you very much they weren\\'t taking them back if we had a murderer from Honduras Guatemala El Salvador we want to bring them back under past administrations they bring them they say we don\\'t want them don\\'t land your plane with us they say thank you very much we will take them back because we\\'ve let them know the price is very bad if they don\\'t do that thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border illegal crossings are down 75% since May and the wall is going up at a very rapid pace the Radical Democrats have gotten more and more extreme and that\\'s why they did this impeachment hoax because Nancy Pelosi had absolutely no control she knew what was going to happen she knew the radical left has taken over the Democrat Party Democrats are pushing for a socialist takeover of health care that would strip you of the doctor and coverage of your choice we have a hundred and eighty million people with private health care that love it they\\'re going to take it away from you I don\\'t think so crazy Elizabeth Warren or as I affectionately call her Pocahontas [Applause] her ridiculous plan would cost fifty two trillion dollars that\\'s more money than we take in in one year two years three years four years five years six years about seven years that\\'s for one year fifty-two trillion dollars and you don\\'t have your doctor I mean the whole course she\\'s starting to crash again you know I thought I knocked her down I did that heavy heavy book hard to steal I give her credit I thought she was left for I mean there were like just little embers and then she rose she Rose said she became strong but then she opened that fresh mouth of hers and it stopped it\\'s that I don\\'t see her as if I don\\'t think she makes it I mean you don\\'t know crazy things are happening in the Democrat Party used to be a sane party now it\\'s an insane party so you don\\'t know but they\\'re all looking at the same thing I mean you have Alfred E Newman who\\'s running the who\\'s like this guy this guy Buddha Chen who that judge can you believe he\\'s doing well he\\'s like the leading fundraiser I dream about him it\\'s true now boot EDH but I\\'m not going too far with any of these people because I thought you know I was way too early with Elizabeth Warren we destroyed her too fast so she came back but she\\'s going back down again did anybody see her beer deal where she said oh darling you see that dear darling it\\'s about her husband darling it\\'s great to see you what are you doing here it\\'s like that\\'s her husband\\'s supposed to be living in the house you\\'re here and I don\\'t think she\\'s seen him in ten years hey I have an idea can I get a beer let\\'s get up here you know sue wants to be one of the group hey let\\'s get a beer did you ever see such a phony disgusting [Music] Republicans will defend your sacred right to choose the doctor and you can choose your plan and you choose the plan that\\'s right for you we will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions we will also protect your right to get the physician that you want virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth and this character in Virginia do you see the Virginia Governor I mean he gave a whole expose the baby is born and then basically they start talking to the month of the baby is born and there\\'s no other word if the mother decides no then they execute the baby okay he\\'s the governor of Virginia and why the Republicans aren\\'t going to win Virginia this next election 2020 I\\'ll tell you what we\\'re gonna give it a very strong shot when you have people like that we\\'re gonna give it a very strong shot but that\\'s why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God [Applause] Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American dream and the party of Honest Abe Lincoln party of abling I told you about judges I\\'m telling you about so many other things there is nobody that\\'s ever done what we\\'re doing you look at school choice for every child in America who needs it including the 50,000 Pennsylvania students who your Democrat governor has blocked from getting school choice scholarships no scholarships available what\\'s that all about how did that happen I would drew from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal a disaster I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jersey for years you watch as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Pennsylvania and you\\'ve never had that better year never at stake in our present battle is their survival of the American nation itself it\\'s the survival we will destroy our country if these people get in you know I say we\\'ve done so much in the first three years will soon be four years all of a sudden the time will be up but it\\'s like when you plant a tree it needs time to grab on it needs time you to get it let it\\'s gotta go rap and that\\'s what we need we need time and we have other things we\\'re going to do that are incredible we still have tremendous regulation cutting that we could do you know we\\'ve cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country we did it in less than two and a half years at two and a half year we did it in less than two and a half years and some had eight years one had more than eight year more regulation and we have regulation and you need some regulation but you don\\'t need regulation that doesn\\'t allow you to build a simple road or highway so what we\\'ve done has been incredible that\\'s one of the reasons their job numbers are so good if you want your children to inherit the birthright of American liberty that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020 and we have to get rid of the Democrats in the House of Representative they are stone cold raising only

beautiful journey I just said to the first lady you\\'re so lucky I took you on this fantastic journey it\\'s so much fun they want to impeach you they want to do worse than that by the way by the way by the way it doesn\\'t really feel like we\\'re being impeached the country is doing better than ever before we did nothing wrong we did nothing wrong and we have tremendous support in the Republican Party like we\\'ve never had before nobody\\'s ever had this kind of but this sacred season our country is thriving and it\\'s thriving truly like it has never it has never happened before to the extent what\\'s happening now and by the way your state because of us not because of local government but because of us because of the job that we\\'ve done because I understand she\\'s not fixing those bottles I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I you I I I way back and I say fill those two seats I don\\'t want them to see it because they\\'ll say couldn\\'t fill up the arena these are truly dishonest people after three years of sinister witch-hunt hoaxes scams tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic among capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history was at the grandest remember when they all said remember when they all said don\\'t know you can\\'t win Michigan you can\\'t I said I went I did one in Grand Rapids right bedrock and we have 32,000 people that night it was one o\\'clock in the morning that means it was election day when I started speaking Hillary Barack Obama Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton they did an emergency trip they did an emergency trip to Michigan at six o\\'clock they got here at prime time they started to speak she had 500 people I got here at one o\\'clock in the morning the next day which is now Election Day how many people were there thirty two thousand thirty two thirty two thousand people outside in Sun was the last speech of Michigan and they said well sir it\\'s very hard to win Michigan I said why would it be hard here\\'s the beautiful thing everything I told you I\\'ve done but much more so I said I was going to bring car companies back I said I was going to bring in I just hope you people know that I just hope [Applause] but I\\'ll never forget that night and you know in all fairness to Bill Clinton you know he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for office I like him I like him but he told you know the way they tried to shut him out right cuz he\\'s a pro he\\'s an instinct guy right he\\'s instinct he doesn\\'t need polling companies you know who the hell wants him you know if you want a polling company pick up the newspaper the problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write they write fake balls so they write fake polls you call them suppression polls you read them and you get the press because it looks like you\\'re doing badly they do that I think it\\'s almost worse than what they write and you can\\'t get much worse they want their right so what happens so what happens is Bill Clinton said to crooked Hillary his very dishonest wife said crooked Hillary do you think he calls her crooked Hillary might maybe he just calls her crooked he said crooked I\\'m telling you crooked I don\\'t like what I\\'m seeing in Michigan I don\\'t like what I\\'m seeing in Wisconsin he said I I took the chip to Wisconsin and I\\'ll tell you what they had those Trump ensigns all the way to the convention area every lawn every lawn I don\\'t like Wisconsin and they said aw don\\'t worry about what the hell does he know they told him what do you know remember they shut him out at the end they didn\\'t what I\\'m talking he was right I mean I don\\'t want to cause any problems in the family but he was right but he talked about Wisconsin things he talked about Michigan he said crooked I\\'m telling you I don\\'t like what I\\'m seeing Michigan I was in Michigan and I\\'m telling you that those damn signs I saw some houses where that four of them on one lawn and two of them on the car and he said you horrible human being you better start listening to me because you\\'re gonna get your ass whooped and you know what happened you know what happened she didn\\'t listen fortunately and she didn\\'t come to Michigan enough and she didn\\'t come to Wisconsin I think at all right because her polling data looked good it looked good to me - every time I went there with these crowds so we won Wisconsin we won Michigan and the great Ronna McDaniel where is Rana Rana she was so horrible I didn\\'t know her Rana McDaniel and she was so aggressive she kept calling say could you please come out to Michigan I said who the hell are you and I said I said what do you mean another trip Sunday where I made we had these big crowds I met it again then finally I said two weeks out I said running no more we\\'re gonna win it or we\\'re not no okay okay I promise two days later I get a call sir could you please come out to Michigan one more time [Applause] sigh sound she was the campaign chairman in Michigan so I said okay and then I got the ultimate call six o\\'clock in the evening for this final deal in Grand Rapids sir could you come to Michigan tonight and I thought I was just about finished I went to a last great State and I said it\\'s over now I sit back and I watch it let\\'s see what happens right but she said could you come to Michigan I said that is the most aggressive human being I\\'ve ever and we did it [Applause] and we won Michigan and the word is that were much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 [Applause] you better remember when you walk in it you know it\\'s November 3rd this time November 3rd by the way though that evening that incredible evening in November right one of the biggest nights in the history of television you never hear them say it so I might as well that election in my debates you see their debates are dying who wants to watch Buddha tej Buddha jet whoo there\\'s edge you know that you pronounce it they say I heard some guys saying no no because it\\'s an unpronounceable name that\\'s why they call them mayor Pete mayor Pete mayor Pete I\\'ve had you up to here mayor Pete now boo dad dad just leading how does boots know you say it this way you say it they call a mayor Pete cuz nobody can pronounce his last name that\\'s the only you know people think it said by the way you know what I\\'m not gonna say bad things about him you know what I\\'d love him to win I thought I knocked off Pocahontas I did it a year too early a year too early I give her credit she then started to come back I don\\'t think she\\'s gonna make it though she\\'s gasping she\\'s gasping for air but I saw them pronouncing Buddha touch and they said here\\'s what you do boot edge edge say edge like the edge of a building edge edge who that judge Alfred e Newman you got to be older to know what that means but congressional Democrats are directly attacking 2.3 million Michigan voters who rose up in 2016 1 this state and now the Democrats are very upset they want to get Michigan back they just don\\'t know how to do it because they didn\\'t do a thing for mission they didn\\'t do anything from Michigan you just Lord all they did was take away your companies and let him go to Mexico and other places you know I don\\'t know if you know it Mexico has 32% of your car business you know that right not because of me they\\'re not moving but Mexico has 30 to the 32 percent of our core business moved to Mexico can you believe this before I got there but that\\'s what I used to talk about I said what I was on earth at night I said how do you let this happen how do you let all these companies leave it used to go it\\'s probably maybe the single biggest reason I ran for president it might be the thing that I had a lot of them immigration I had a lot of them but that may be the single biggest with today\\'s illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment the do-nothing Democrats and they are do nothing all they want to do is focus on this what they could be doing are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the American voter this lawless partisan impeachment is a political suicide March for the Democrat Party have you seen my polls in the last four weeks [Applause] it\\'s crazy you know why because people you know we have an election right down the road I announced three months ago that I\\'m running right I\\'ll give you a little clue I announced because I figured once they announced they\\'d never impeach nobody would be so stupid but they\\'ve been trying to impeach me from day one they\\'ve been trying to impeach me from before I ran okay because if you remember when I ran I went immediately to number one never came off the night we had center stage from day one in the debates so we had I don\\'t know 14 15 debates we had a total of 18 actually people forgot there was one that they never thought about but that\\'s okay but we had 18 people and I was center stage and I said wait a minute this is no good I want Aude numbers because of your center stage if you have a ten that means two people are in the middle so I said make it 11 or make it nine okay or I\\'m not showing up and generally they did it because we were way ahead from the beginning but I made a lot of great friends out of that group and many of them are good friends today although you wouldn\\'t know it based on the they say that was the meanest that was a pretty mean primary you got to say wasn\\'t that fun through there I liked it through their depraved actions today crazy Nancy Pelosi\\'s House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame in it it really is it\\'s a disgrace Democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president they think that the Washington swamp which we believe it or not it ain\\'t easy because they got so much stacked including these guys you know what these guys are a part of the Democrat Party they are a part of you might as well call them Democrats know the media look look I don\\'t you know it\\'s hard for somebody to know if you\\'re not the subject cuz how do you know the New York Times is totally dishonest or the Washington Post or ABC is so bad CBS so bad NBC I made a lot of money for NBC with The Apprentice right a lot of money a lot plus we had the number one show a lot and they had nothing in the top ten except a thing called The Apprentice and they treat me so bad I brilliantly said well one group I know will treat me well NBC I call it commie cast you know it\\'s owned by commie care they\\'re just as bad as CNN or they\\'re just as bad as MSNBC and by the way CNN and MSNBC their ratings are down the tubes it\\'s great I love I love it but they think the Washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election that\\'s what they think there\\'s never been a time like this think of it you have the greatest economy in the history of the world other countries come to see me all of their leaders and they say sir first thing sir congratulations on your economy we\\'re trying to do the same thing congratulations and these guys don\\'t like talking about it and if they do they say Obama did it Obama remember Obama said you will never be President he will never be President then remember he said I will consider it a personal affront if you allow him to be President and then I became president he wasn\\'t so happy and in all fairness he campaigned harder than crooked Hillary because he had more strength I mean I go to these places you know Secret Service they take me ivoncita lobby in three years I go through basements I pass compactor plants I know more about compactors from this job I don\\'t see lobbies I say fellas you think you could ever baby take me through a lobby no sir but I\\'ll tell you what I go upstairs downstairs all around they taking me up three flights go down one I said are we almost there yes sir got the four flights and I say you think Hillary could do this I don\\'t think so they bring her back home she wants to go to sleep and now I hear she wants to run again wouldn\\'t that be great thank you Oh would we love that you think the Democrats are screwed up wait\\'ll that happens wouldn\\'t that be all it is my guy welllook based on the FBI report you just saw what happened with the IG where they came out with the FBI based on that you know what I never stopped you but now think of what they did think of what they did think of how dishonest it all was they shouldn\\'t even be allowed to have an impeachment because it was based on dishonesty it was based on illegalities she went out and they paid for a fake dossier they gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier totally disproven totally fake the FBI then took that fake dossier and they used it in the FISA Court to get approval to spy on my campaign and if we were Democrats they would have been in jail two years ago it\\'s at this straight think of what they did so they use this fake dossier and they brought it before this big deal court it\\'s a big deal the FISA Court and they said this stuff and they lied about it because Comey use another beauty did I do a great job when I fired his ass what a great time oh no they had bad plans no way I did a great thing that was like throwing a rock at a hornet\\'s nest did that place explode and then we learned about Lisa Paige and her wonderful lover Peter struck I love you Lisa I love you more than anybody in the world I love you more than anybody in the world causes problems with the wife but we won\\'t talk about that those tapes didn\\'t work well no how about those statements right and then they say in all fairness I really like the report but how does the Inspector General say because don\\'t forget he was appointed by Obama so I\\'m not knocking him because he gave us a lot of Nuggets but we had a lot of those Nuggets how does the Inspector General saying you have these horrible he\\'s going to lose isn\\'t he he\\'s going to lose or she\\'s going to win 100 middie didn\\'t you see all the zero so it\\'s like I\\'m lucky that says I think it\\'s a hundred he\\'s going to lose one hundred to one isn\\'t he Peter I love you so much Peter I\\'ve never loved anyone like you he\\'s gonna lose 100 million to one Peter right that\\'s right he\\'s gonna 100 but there\\'s no bias how about the insurance fine to me the greatest just in case she loses we have an insurance policy we\\'re in the insurance policy right now folks we\\'ve been in it for three years that\\'s what they met I mean the insurance policy is on an artificial respirator because we\\'re doing awfully well and I\\'ll tell you something rush limbaugh said it Sean Hannity said it Laura Ingram said it Tucker said it Aynsley said it but a lot of people have said it they said there\\'s nobody in the world that could have handled that stuff that happened and still created what are the greatest economies and done more than any other president ever before in the first three years I understand that I understand that but it\\'s my life very unfair to my family I have to say this very very unfair to my family what they put my family through is a disgrace me it\\'s my life it\\'s fine I do but you know what what they put my family through is a disgrace and they ought to be ashamed and we should get apologies all over the place so yesterday I sent Pelosi a letter denouncing and condemning or parties outrageous abuse of power that\\'s what it is they have nothing they\\'re the ones that should be impeached every one of them [Applause] I mean you got this guy shift he makes up a statement and he goes in front of Congress where he has immunity and he makes up a statement from me that\\'s totally fictitious totally out of thin air the worst statement I\\'ve ever heard many people saw I had a person two weeks ago said I didn\\'t love the statement you made I said really didn\\'t you read the you know transcript said I always say read the transcript but didn\\'t you read no no I heard it on television I watched Adam Schiff he made it up I then sent him the transcript he said oh now I feel better that\\'s perfect I call a perfect he called the perfect everyone calls it if you read it but here\\'s the thing he makes up this statement and it finished didn\\'t he have eight quid pro quos eight could you imagine you\\'re dealing with the country and you say eight times that you got to do something the first time they say well the second time they say it\\'s strange third time they say what\\'s wrong you said eight times eight times then have you arrested that have you put into an insane asylum but he actually said I think he said eight not seven eight and then he finished with don\\'t call me I\\'ll call you can you imagine the president the United States don\\'t call me I\\'ll call you you know what that is it\\'s a mafia statement okay that\\'s the head of the mafia saying don\\'t call me ok this guy actually said that and then he walked away and people became incensed because they knew that was that the people that read the thing most people believed him because you know he\\'s a corrupt politician hundred percent no he\\'s a corrupt but and then I see him by the way you ever see this guy he walks up to the mics I mean we\\'re not it often look I don\\'t want to be because with me too I never even think about looks anymore ok I don\\'t talk about looks of a male or female but in his case let\\'s just say last time I\\'ll ever refer to this he\\'s not exactly the best-looking guy we\\'ve ever seen no any mic he walks up to the monk and he\\'s so polishes this is a sad sad day for America our president is an employee of Russia I have absolute proof that the president this is at the beginning and every week they say where\\'s the proof it\\'s coming it\\'s coming then we get the molar report nothing and I\\'ll tell you what I know some of the people in this audience if I spent not forty five billion not eighteen trumpeters okay angry I call me angry Democrats it was thirteen then I went to 18 and then Muller did Muller do a good job did he how is his performance in front of Congress not the best but think of this 45 million they spent and you know I heard somebody say well we got back some of that money I\\'m saying you cost this country billions and billions and billions of dollars in all of the things that didn\\'t get done in all of the embarrassment to our country you caused billions and billions of dollars and it was a hoax but this guy Schiff I have absolute proof I have this so I have I have that this any kind any time he sees the camera and he stone-faced right Stoneface he\\'s a pathological liar he gets up and I\\'ve never seen anything like it even I was saying I wonder what he has what does he have he says I have absolutely said I haven\\'t spoken to Russia in you what the hell do I have to do with Russia but this guy gets up oh I think we have a vote coming in so we got every single Republican voted for us whoa Wow Wow almost 200 so so we had 198 229 198 we didn\\'t lose one Republican vote and and three Democrats voted for us Haley Haley Thank You Haley great job Wow the Republican Party has never been so afraid but they\\'ve never been so United as they are right now ever never and I know the Senators and they\\'re great guys and women too we have some great women we have great guys and great people they love this country they\\'re gonna do the right thing ain\\'t gonna do the right so I said in my letter to Pelosi I love that you know usually there\\'s one to the Republicans look I\\'ve said it for a long time the Democrats are lousy politicians they really are they\\'ve got horrible policies open borders crime is fine drugs pouring through I mean think of what they do sanctuary cities they love sanctuary cities they\\'re lousy politicians but they have one thing two things they\\'re vicious they\\'re the most vicious people the Republicans aren\\'t as vicious they may learn to be vicious after going through this stuff but the other thing that Democrats always stick together now think of it three Democrats went over to our side no Republicans what it\\'s honor and by the way this is for a hundred years I\\'m not just talking about this little point in time the Republicans are known as it\\'s always harder to stick together these people are great we have a great Republican Party and we have to get that change we have to take back the house you\\'ll have the greatest health care ever if we take by the way we had another victory the individual mandate just a little while ago came over the wires it was just upheld the individual mandate is now gone the most unpopular part of Obama we\\'re just up hell so I said in my letter to Pelosi by proceeding with you\\'re invalid impeachment you\\'re violating your oath of office you\\'re breaking your allegiance to the Constitution you\\'re declaring open war on American democracy you dare to invoke the founding fathers in pursuit of this election nullification scheme yet you\\'re spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America\\'s Founding and you\\'re egregious conduct and listen though it\\'s so true it threatens to destroy what our founders pledged and in fact their very lives to build you are the ones interfering in America\\'s elections you are the one subverting America\\'s democracy we did nothing wrong nothing whatsoever this was just an excuse you are the ones obstructing justice you are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our republic for your own selfish personal political and partisan game that bringing pain the work we could be doing on lowering drug prices on getting rid of these horrible horrible situations you know and the border the woman is okay she\\'s okay okay thank you very much thank you I mean some of these people are waiting here for three days right thank you they\\'ll come back come back thank you Merry Christmas is true but what they\\'ve done with this perversion its perversion and when you watch some of these people get up and speak today they don\\'t even look oh you have violated the constitution well what has he done wrong well we don\\'t know that they don\\'t even have any crime this is the first impeachment where there\\'s no crime I say tell me what I did please well we don\\'t know you violated the Constitution you had Turley who\\'s smart Alan Dershowitz these guys all of them they say there\\'s no crime there\\'s no crime right there\\'s no crime I\\'m the first person that ever get it beats in this little crime I feel like I feel guilty you know they call it impeachment like its impeachment like that\\'s why you know with Richard Nixon I just see it as a very dark era very dark very you all but you don\\'t even like to think I don\\'t know about you but I\\'m having a good time it\\'s crazy but I also know we have a great group of people behind us in the Republican Party we really do maybe I wouldn\\'t feel the same way but we have a great group of people behind us we had it in the house oh we have it in the Senate they\\'re doing a great job so I\\'m not worried I\\'m not worried because it\\'s always good when you don\\'t do anything wrong you get impeached that may be a record that will last forever but you know what they have done they\\'ve cheapened the impeachment process and now now anybody that becomes you know this was a sacred position anybody that becomes president I mean they could have a phone call and they get impeached so if the Republicans have you had a Democrat as president we have a Republican house they don\\'t like the guy for whatever reason or the woman they impeach the person it\\'s cheap ndon it\\'s exactly what our founding fathers didn\\'t want and they said it could happen and it\\'s happening but I know one thing Americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote Pelosi the hell out of office [Applause] but it\\'s so disappointing I see a woman carolyn maloney she\\'s a long time nothing much believe me she\\'s a congresswoman from Manhattan Eastside I was with her her first race I helped her she was always so nice oh thank you thank I\\'ve made lots of contributions over the years you know and New York if you\\'re not it\\'s like purely Democrat especially Manhattan so what happens I make lots of contributions years and years and years I go run the first person I see carolyn Maloney I raised my hand to impeach well give me back that there money that I\\'ve been paying her for some let her pay me back all the money let her pay me back all the money then you have this Dingle Dingle you know dingo from michigan you know bingo never here over Michigan Debbie think that\\'s a real beauty so she calls me up like eight months ago her husband was there a long time but I didn\\'t give him the bee treatment I didn\\'t give him the C or the D I could have nobody would ask you know I gave the A+ treatment take down the flags why are you taking him down 4x congressman Dingell oh okay do this do that do that Rotunda everything I gave him everything that\\'s okay I don\\'t want anything for it I don\\'t need anything for anything she calls me up it\\'s the nicest thing that\\'s ever happened thank you so much John would be so thrilled he\\'s looking down he\\'d be something thank you so much sir I said that\\'s okay don\\'t worry about it maybe he\\'s looking up but let\\'s assume he\\'s looking down but I gave him a plus not a not b plus stuffy I gave him the A+ and she called me Sheldon I oh I won\\'t go into the conversation because it\\'s not fair to do that but all I want to say is let\\'s put it this way it was the most profuse thank you that you could ever get or the scale of zero to ten it was a ten okay so that was what February or something now they talked about this phony in patron and she\\'s out there well we have to look seriously at our president because he may have violated the Constitution of the United States and I can\\'t be happy with that because I love our country I love this that I love that she loves everything I said she\\'s a no okay no but I look at her and she says sincere and what happens I vote to impeach Trump and you know what I didn\\'t say who the hell do this was even going to come up I went through the whole Muller hoax they did this big report I was totally exonerated they didn\\'t even bring it up at the impeachment because I was totally exonerated if they saw one little kernel one little quarter of a cent look what they did with one word remember this what did i do what did i do it\\'s it\\'s us but they don\\'t say it that way they say I they read a totally different you know Schiff and his band of thieves they read it now I say basically very simple do us a favor or country do us there was I mean our country and then what do I say I say the United States attorney general attorney general of the United States could speak to you would be great okay because it\\'s known for major corruption in fact the new leader of Ukraine got in on a construction on a a platform where he looks for all of the problems of dishonesty and everything that was going on in Ukraine right he looked for it that\\'s how he got into office he got into office that way so we take it and they repeat it a thousand times and they never say with the right so I go wild and we start and the Republicans have got it right now we always correct him but I used the word us us is the United States our country and then it actually says I think comma country but they don\\'t say that they say do me a favor how many times have you heard it where they say it is speech and then the president said do me a favor well that\\'s not what I said I said do us a favor our country and then I said the Attorney General of the United States I didn\\'t say my campaign manager okay I said the attorney and these people want to impeach the President of the United States oh and then what happened right then what happened so then the president of Ukraine who\\'s a quality person said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever that was a killer for the Democrats right then his foreign minister said the same thing he said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever there was no pressure that\\'s a killer so now did you see what the Democrats did a couple of days ago they tried to say that he\\'s not a strong person that he was weak they used the word weak that he was weak and under the power of trouble he said do you know how insulting that is anybody that becomes president of a country and that\\'s a big country and it\\'s a tough country he gotta be tough he\\'s tough but so what they\\'re saying now is he was weak because the wording is just doesn\\'t fit okay these are really dishonest people and if the press was fair this thing never would have happened so the House Democrats are surrendering their majority their dignity their reputations they look like a bunch of fools and I\\'ll tell you we have a lot of new stars in the Republican Party I could read off a list of 20 names but they\\'re giving up their honor and they\\'ll receive a big backlash at the box office when you take a look that ballot box that ballot box on November 3rd I think we\\'re gonna have crowds like we\\'ve never had and I\\'ll tell you something it used to be you know that oh so the Republicans you know in 2018 in 2018 I didn\\'t run I didn\\'t run right they all said oh we did well actually we picked up two seats in the Senate that these guys never talk about we just approved 171 Supreme Court justices federal court justice 171 federal justices including courts of Appeal 171 will be up probably by the end of the 282 and for that I thank President Obama he gave me a hundred and forty two openings you know he gave me a hundred and forty two I said to him Mike people I got there because they say the most important thing you could do as a president is judges and Supreme Court we have two great Supreme Court judges right two justices of the Supreme Court Cavanaugh corsets two great men they\\'re great and how about the pain that they put justice Cavanaugh through over a phony deal later daya over a phony deal what a disgrace what they put that band through and that family through just remember it come November you got to remember it\\'s a long time you know in the life of Trump ten months is an eternity come on somebody said congratulations sir you gonna wear I said don\\'t say that just don\\'t talk about it let\\'s always pretend you one point down like last time gonna be close no it\\'s gonna be close but what they put that man through is horrible what they put his family through was horrible and you know those stories largely have been recanted and frankly the ones that didn\\'t recant I don\\'t know what a Supreme Court judge does but he should sue them he should see them so we want to take back the house will hold the Senate and we\\'ll keep the White House you will have the greatest health care you will continue with the greatest judges you know we have judges that are we just had a great story in The Wall Street Journal I have to tell I have to be always very truthful because if I\\'m a little bit off they call me a liar they\\'ll say he gets a Pinocchio the stupid Washington Post there Pinocchio I mean even if you like saying things perfectly it\\'s a Pinocchio there\\'s nothing you can say well you don\\'t get a Pinocchio but what happens what happens is we have Wall Street Journal the other day got the best story they said whether you like him or not the job he\\'s done on judges and Supreme Court justices but the job he\\'s done on judges there\\'s a mess say it\\'s the most important thing see I don\\'t agree with him I say defense is the most the military\\'s but but once you\\'re beyond the military I mean to me defense is the most important because without good defense maybe we don\\'t need judges so much right it\\'s like somebody said what we violated the budget I said do me a favor don\\'t worry about the budget if we\\'re attacked and aren\\'t doing very well and somebody says well at least we have a good budget that doesn\\'t work too well right that doesn\\'t work so we have great military we have great judges we have great everything our drug prices down for the first time in 51 years drug prices Canada and that was with no help from the Democrats if they help because you need their votes if they helped I could get those drug prices down forty and fifty percent okay and we just approved and we\\'re approving very soon for the governor of Florida run to Santas where he could buy he has the right to go we\\'re giving him the right to go and buy from a foreign country where the prices for the identical drug identical drug are 50% less and he\\'s going to do that for the people of Florida and we\\'re going to do that for your governors if they want to do then we\\'ll get that down so far everyone in America could see straight through the Washington Democrats phony dangerous charade Schiff makes up so many things Pelosi makes it up and she backs him up I saw her on a television show and George Stephanopoulos it\\'s another beauty he said even he said he was defending me I couldn\\'t believe it he made the Sabin but you know he lied on that he made up the step no he didn\\'t it so that means Nancy Pelosi said no the statement that he made up but it\\'s all gonna end soon and it\\'s gonna come out to a beautiful great victory for the Republican Party and for this hunter thank you very much so that\\'s it we have the greatest country we\\'ve turned around a ship we need four more years if we don\\'t have them now if you want to drive them crazy we had one group in Pennsylvania some guys started screaming 16 more years they went crazy and you know what they don\\'t understand when I do get out they\\'re all going to go out of business they make it more money than they\\'ve ever been that crazy New York Times one of the worst newspapers and one of the most dishonest newspapers in the history of the world totally phony they came out with a story that was where was a great headline for me and the people that read it the super radical left they called and complained so much if they changed the headline and took it from positive to negative or a good story can you believe it now they\\'re among the most dishonest people but I never forget before I took that great escalator ride down with our first lady our first lady\\'s daughter grant I said first lady you\\'re so lucky I took you on this journey this wonderful beautiful journey and it is you know why it\\'s a wonderful beautiful journey because look at we\\'re accomplished what we\\'re accomplishing is unbelievable it\\'s unprecedented it is unprecedented what we\\'re accomplished there so lucky I say to all my people I\\'ve great people in the back I say you folks are so lucky I took you on this you could be home right now relaxing but I\\'d rather be here frankly than any place these rallies are great they\\'re inspiring you are inspired and you know it\\'s funny we\\'re not even into election season yeah it\\'s a long way away we\\'re not even in it and yet I think the enthusiasm right now is greater than it was even before the 2016 election does that make I think a lot of it has to do with the witch hunt a lot of it has to do with the phony which one because you\\'re smart people you know you\\'re the elite they\\'re not the elite you\\'re the elite you\\'re the elite you do better than they do they talk about I don\\'t you hate it it will be elite oh really I went to better schools many of you went to better schools we won\\'t talk about homes even though your homes are nicer we won\\'t talk about jobs you see the jobs reports you see what\\'s happening do you see where wages are going up you know when I first started when I was here one of my first speeches I was talking that people made more money that was four years ago so it was 20 years before that that\\'s 24 25 years ago they made more money 24 years ago than they were making when I got elected president and they worked one job versus two or three jobs now it\\'s going up beautifully and we want that the salaries and you know the number one group of people that are going up is the blue-collar worker its percentage the best but blue-collar worker they are two and three jobs the blue-collar worker is going up the most anyway so whereas you know what else the other thing I\\'m happiest about african-american unemployment the lowest in the history of archive african-american remember I used to say you remember look at you are you the greatest guy everyone thinks do I pay I\\'m telling you I have a group of african-american guys and gals by the way that follow me around and they think I pay them and I don\\'t I love them they love me they come how many rallies have you come to a lot they\\'re great people just great thank you [Applause] I don\\'t even know who the hell he is is that right I don\\'t know but I like him I see him at so many rallies I appreciate it you and your group they\\'re great people thank you see you\\'re obviously doing well if you can travel around like that right uh he knows I appreciate it I really do it\\'s I think it\\'s fantastic thank you thank you but think of this african-american unemployment is the lowest it\\'s ever been in the history of our country their poverty levels at a horrible poverty level in the negative sense now their poverty levels are the best they\\'ve ever been in the history of our country same with Hispanic Americans the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers and the same with Asians the best unemployment and women I\\'m sorry 71 years best in 71 years I\\'ve let the women down but I think within another couple of months you\\'ll be historical so only 71 years best the best in 71 years but what we\\'re doing has been an incredible thing it\\'s an incredible thing and when I\\'m on the debate stage with one of these characters and they try and say negative stuff and I\\'ll just say well here\\'s the story in the history of our country this groups doing the best and that groups doing the best and the women are doing the best and everybody\\'s doing and frankly you know what it is the whole country\\'s doing the best okay the whole country is there anyway so we have records on everything and yet they\\'re trying to and they really are they\\'ve never seen anything like it they\\'re accusing me really of doing what Joe by Biden admitted what he did how about this they protect him did you see the did you see that crummy debate those debates are so boring they\\'re dying in the ratings they\\'re dying they\\'re dying while it\\'s totally unsupported what\\'s unsupported he\\'s on tape saying that he\\'s holding back a billion dollars from Ukraine unless she changed the prosecutor Wilders how about that question I won\\'t say who answered because you know I\\'m not I actually used to like the guy he was a nice guy to me but now I don\\'t like him so much but that\\'s okay but he goes well it\\'s totally unsubstantiated and while we beg your mercy that we\\'re asking you even to bring up this question but President Trump said you refused to give a billion dollars of taxpayer money to Ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son\\'s company and sleepy Joe gives a sleepy answer and that\\'s the end of it that\\'s it and then whenever I bring it up do you ever notice they always just while these charges are totally unsubstantiated he\\'s on tape he\\'s if that were me it\\'s the electric chair they would bring the electric chair back not a guys on tape and they always say it\\'s unsubstantiated it is not supported by fact one of them the other day they finally changed the way it is not supported by fact no it\\'s supported by tape now it\\'s unbelievable I in many ways I\\'d like to have him win because number one he\\'s going to have to eventually answer that question and number she said he doesn\\'t know where he is that\\'s the other problem now I\\'ve been doing this for a long time and I have much bigger crowds than anybody\\'s ever had in history by the way do you know what I say it against the fake news because you know what they\\'re gonna say every stadium is packed I give my people one instruction get the largest stadium you can get now that\\'s why I was a little surprised but in Battle Creek you don\\'t have that many right not to a minister but I wanted to be here you know why I wanted to be here first of all the crowd is incredible the crowd outside but let me tell you no you know why I wanted to be in because we don\\'t know we have a lot of choices but I want to be here because this area supported me so overwhelmingly and I said I want to be pretty simple where is it pretty simple I wanted to be here for that reason and I just want to say thank you because I\\'ll tell you what you came in I don\\'t know I didn\\'t get a hundred percent but we got a damn good percentage right so this is it\\'s really thrilling to be here and but we\\'re joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders your Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield wisly Lee come up if you want come on what the hell we have nothing else to do should we get him up yes come up Lee come up Lee get up here come on up link Republican Party chairwoman rana mcdaniel i spoke and the bottom line on the end of her story so what i want i said who\\'s gonna head up the RNC I said I gotta get that woman from Michigan remember they were all saying you can\\'t win Michigan now we\\'re gonna win it by so much you better remember all those every time a car plant opens please think about trouble come on up here leave Michigan GOP chair woman Laura Cox hate to tell you but all your Congressman er you know where they are right now

so they had a choice sir should we leave and be there I said don\\'t leave stay right where you are that\\'s why we got that vote that\\'s the chairman of the woman\\'s workers at workers for Trump and a proud Union auto worker Terry Bowman who\\'s been so terrific thank you come on up and while Democrats are obsessed with impeachment we\\'re focused on jobs jobs jobs this group local leaders and all your Washington folks they\\'re right where they have to be in Washington tonight thank you great job thank you very much we\\'ve eliminated more job-killing regulations than any Administration in the history of our country whether it\\'s four years or eight years or in one case much more than eight years in a period of two and a half years we have eliminated more regulations than any other president by far you\\'re saving almost $3,000 a year because of regulation cuts total income gains for median households will reach $10,000 a family I\\'ll give you a couple of quick numbers so under President Bush for eight years you say four hundred and fifty dollars meaning you took in four hundred and fifty bucks okay fine under President Obama you took in nine hundred and seventy five dollars under President Trump including the energy savings and the regulation savings and the tax cut savings it\\'s more than ten thousand dollars in less than three pretty good so four to eight years yeah a 400 450 and a 975 that\\'s eight years 450 in less than three years you had more than $10,000 it goes right into your pockets it\\'s one of the reasons our economy is doing well because the as they say the consumer is doing better than they\\'ve ever done and that\\'s great that\\'s what we wanted we\\'ve ended the war in American energy in the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas or platinum and these maniacs want to close it up how about going to Texas you know beta remember what he said I said oh this guy\\'s a loser you know his sales would like you for your great salesman you never talked that your great sales and you know walk-in saying oh I\\'m not great sales guy like yourself any guy that does that they\\'re no good those quiet type that get you you know the ones that don\\'t talk so Boehner when he first got in and remember this is a clown he gets in no no he gets it I was made for this job to run for president after about two weeks they killed him he was gone but you remember he was against the Bible he was against religion he was against guns and he was against oil and gas and he comes from Texas I said that\\'s a platform think of it he\\'s against religion he\\'s against guns and he gets oily guests think of it now I don\\'t like to bring it up because he\\'s gonzo but he comes from Texas I said Abraham Lincoln can\\'t win in Texas with that platform but they are all of them they want to close up your energy it\\'s a big deal they want to close up your steel mills they don\\'t want you steel mills look at what I\\'ve done for Steel I mean the steel is back we taxed all at the dump Steel coming in from China and other places and your steel mills are doing great they\\'re expanding all over the country and they were going to be out of business within two years the way they were going they were gone United States Steel is spending now billions of dollars on expansions every major Democrat running for president has pledged to eliminate gas-powered automobiles and destroy the US auto industry forever and you know why because they have these maniacs that say you gotta go all-electric I want to have an alternative a big alternative and you can always have the alternative and a lot of people don\\'t know if the electric can ever catch the gas you know and and and by the way there\\'ll be different forms of energy coming along but they want to close them up and we\\'re not closing them up we\\'re gonna have lots of alternatives so that you can have it from a pricing you can have it for a lot of different reasons we\\'re even bringing back the old light bulb you heard about that right the old lightbulb which is better I say why do I always look so orange you know why cuz they\\'re the new light they\\'re terrible you look terrible they cost you many many times more like four or five times more and you know they\\'re considered hazardous waste when a light bulb is out you\\'ve got to bring it to a dump so let\\'s say over here Battle Creek wishing there\\'s dump okay that\\'s a what a couple of hundred miles away so every time you lose drive a couple of hundred miles right I said how many people do that nobody what do they do they throw it in the garbage but you know what it is because it\\'s all gasps it\\'s much more expensive four or five times more and I came into office I did a lot of this sinks showers all of this stuff I did a lot of it no water comes out you have areas where there\\'s so much water you don\\'t know what to do with that you turn on the shower you\\'re not allowed to have any water anymore I mean we do a lot of it dishwashers did the dishwasher right you press it remember the dishwasher you press it boom there\\'d be like an explosion five minutes later you open it up the steam pours out the dishes now you press it 12 times women tell me again you know they give you four drops of water and there are places where there\\'s so much water they don\\'t know what to do with it so we just came out with a red Gordon\\'s dishwashers we\\'re going back to you by the way by the time they press it ten times you spend more on water and electric don\\'t forget the whole thing is worse because you\\'re spending all that money in electric so we\\'re bringing back standard set of gray and better machinery but you can have the water gun but with the lightbulb I said what\\'s going on with the lightbulb says so a lot of people are complaining about the cost so I had a couple of experts come in I said tell me what gives a better life well we like the old light bulb better I said I like it better and so what I did is you could have either one if you want to buy the newer kind you can and if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind like I do so we\\'re bringing back the old iPhone so it\\'s a much less expensive it probably gives a better light but whatever it is and you\\'ll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb I mean it sounds like little but it\\'s big stuff okay it\\'s big and we\\'re doing it with a lot of other things or dishwashers and you know I won\\'t tell you one of the things cuz every time I tell you they do a big number on it you know what I\\'m talking about right sinks right showers and what goes with a sink of the shower 10 times right Tenten wha Bob not me of course not me but you him but I never mentioned that because one time I mentioned all three I said sinks showers and toilets the headline was Trump with the toilets toilets that\\'s all they were they don\\'t even mention that so I didn\\'t mention that okay I go off the record but you know what it\\'s terrible you want to wash your hands you turn on the sink the water comes out so you leave the water go ten times as long it\\'s the same thing you have a shower drew it\\'s no good for me for me you know the one thing that came out really good about being in this business I used that they always used to say I wore a hairpiece it\\'s okay I know people were hippies but they always used to say they don\\'t say that anymore because I have been through the worst storms if you wear one of those suckers you got to give it up fast cuz within two weeks they got you you look handsome don\\'t worry about it but in the last two decades before my election we lost one in five auto manufacturing jobs in this country the people are trying to impeach us for doing all of the things that they\\'ve wanted to do for so many years and that\\'s why it doesn\\'t work we look so forward to taking it on and it is all about cleaning the swamp draining the swamp and we have a very very big bad dangerous swamp okay that\\'s enough of them that\\'s enough so among the very first acts that I did was to stop the deal that would have dealt a death blow to the US auto industry I withdrew from the horrible trans-pacific partnership that would have ended your auto industry a lot of people don\\'t know that but I do the transit remember TPP we were basically ceding our auto industry to these countries that were just going to rip us off hell with the people that made these trade deals it\\'s like where do they come like the one in Korea that was a Hillary Clinton special oh she said this will produce 250,000 new jobs and I said well what happened he said well she was right except it was for South Korea not for us oh so it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea these deals were so bad but now they\\'re getting really good and some of them are getting like great and over a period of time they\\'re gonna be phenomenal where do you see the numbers that start coming out of this country over a short period of time the new put we have to go through a little pain because we have to do it and then they all say we\\'re gonna withdraw and then I say you can withdraw I don\\'t care we\\'re putting tariffs in your country then they say we\\'d love to make a deal sir the new us mca has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in michigan where they belong since the election we\\'ve created 41,000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs manufacturing jobs remember the statement by president obama you\\'d have to wave a magic wand remember the magic wand because manufacturing and i said you know that sounds strange what do you do if you don\\'t have manufacturing how do you make things right manufacturing jobs won\\'t happen well we\\'ve got six hundred thousand manufacturing jobs and you\\'re gonna see a big big input i mean the truth is we need more people you know what we need more people we need more people coming into the country and they\\'re going to come in and they\\'re going to come in through merit and they\\'re gonna love our country and they\\'re going to respect our country and they\\'re gonna work we do need more people there opening these mess at Foxconn in Wisconsin they\\'re opening these massive plants and it\\'s hard to get people we want people coming in but they have to come in only they have to come in through merit fiat-chrysler recently announced a 4.5 billion dollar investment in Michigan including the first new auto plant in Detroit in more than a generation and General Motors recently announced a 300 million dollar investment at its Oriya on assembly plant right here in Michigan come on General Motors that\\'s bad General Motors gave us a little hard time with one building wasn\\'t happy about that it was the only building I had a problem with in the whole car industry right right you know the one I\\'m talking about I didn\\'t like that anyway but they\\'re spending money you know what can I tell you but these companies are coming in a lot of the foreign companies are coming because they have to I say you have to well we\\'re not trading with you anymore because we had such big deficits with these these countries with Japan we had a 68 billion dollar deficit I said Shinzo he\\'s great Prime Minister of Japan but he said but nobody has ever asked us to do this I said I\\'m asking you and they\\'re building many many plans they\\'re building many plants now in the United States the Japanese after years of rebuilding foreign nations we are finally rebuilding our nation is that okay we were surrounded with globalists you know they think it\\'s okay you open a plant in some country that you never heard of they make your product they send it in the meantime they close all their factories here we\\'re not doing that anymore those are globalists they think it\\'s wonderful to have deficits I don\\'t they think it\\'s great it\\'s a great thing to have deficits know those are globalists the globalists are passe when no issue have Democrat politicians more thoroughly betrayed the American people than immigration every Democrat running for president wants to open the floodgates to unlimited refugees from all around the world overwhelming your communities and putting our national security at grave risk my administration has taken bold action to reduce the influx of refugees and we are making sure local communities like yours have a much greater say about who gets admitted into your own neighborhoods some of these stories are so sad some of the stories are so saying when it comes to setting immigration policy we always remember this sacred earth our first duty and our one true allegiance is to you the American people before anybody else we must care for our own citizens first Democrat immigration policies are resulting in brutal assaults and wicked murders against innocent Americans I don\\'t know if you even know what\\'s happening it\\'s terrible and we\\'ve moved out thousands and thousands of ms-13 thugs out of our country and we have agreements now with Guatemala Honduras El Salvador you know they didn\\'t used to take him back if we had a murderer and we should get him the hell out you know we don\\'t really want him in our prisons and take care of him for 50 60 years we want to bring him back they wouldn\\'t take him the planes used to go around and around don\\'t land don\\'t live with us they land we worked at deals with every one of them we stopped giving them all the aid you know we give it him all this money and then they said we\\'re not gonna let you land we\\'re not gonna let you take him back I said that\\'s okay 500 million we were giving him I said now we give him five dollars we give him nothing all of a sudden they said we would love to have them back it\\'s wonderful to have them back in June to illegal aliens in Sandusky Michigan were convicted of sadistically beating and stabbing a woman to death with a kitchen knife then they hid her body in a water drained a criminal airing with two previous deportations was just arrested in Michigan and convicted of brutally beating and strangling to death a single mother of five young children it\\'s happening all the time far-left politicians support deadly sanctuary cities which deliberately release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of the jails and directly onto your streets you know we had a great election in North Carolina recently two great congressmen got elected you don\\'t hear but when they win you don\\'t ever hear about it just a few months ago two great people and they got elected and they got elected because I wanted the innocent you don\\'t talk about the fact that you have sanctuary cities and they had some horrible crimes happening from those sanctuary cities soon as I mentioned that boom they went up like rocket ships and they won their elections and it was great great thing these sanctuary cities are a disaster and let me tell you the people of California they don\\'t like sanctuary cities either they\\'re stuck with them because they have crazy politicians earlier this year authorities in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Kent County Michigan anybody know Kent County released an illegal aliens with assault with intent to murder after he repeatedly and viciously stabbed a man in the head with a broken bottle they let him go to roam free in Michigan communities if you want to end sanctuary cities in Michigan if you want to protect your families from criminal aliens if you want to have a safe life frankly it\\'s so crazy what they\\'re doing you wouldn\\'t even believe it you have only one choice in 2020 you must vote Republican thank you I\\'m surprised you as you know you do have sanctuary cities in Michigan I was almost surprised to hear but you have it\\'s one of those progressive things they think they\\'re doing a wonderful favor for the world and now we\\'re getting these prosecutors that you know you murder somebody they give you two months they fight that you don\\'t even have to go to jail what\\'s going on is crazy thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border illegal crossings are down seventy five percent since man and we\\'ve ended catch and release we\\'ve ended it we could have ended it so easy it\\'s called the loophole you catch him and then you release him into our country that\\'s what you had to do by law and if you don\\'t do that they arrest the Border Patrol people and you believe this the Border Patrol people were in more danger than the criminal aliens coming in and some of these people are not good people some will remember the the caravans coming up we call them caravans and they they\\'re interviewing the people I\\'ve ever forget it one nice citizen reporter female reporter and what did you do well I want to come to America okay good what did you do murder but this is a live television they didn\\'t play that clip too long you know one of the one of the beauties back there what did you do murder oh yeah yeah these are the people because look when you have a caravan of eight or ten thousand people a lot of those people do you think that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador do you think they\\'re sending us their finest I don\\'t think so okay how about the lottery that was a Schumer deal you know Chuck Schumer crying Chuck crying shucks Jim you know I used to be a big contributor to he used to kiss my ass Chuck Schumer he\\'d do anything he would have done anything for me I didn\\'t think I asked him gets him on the phone you do this you do that you get him on the phone it\\'s any bitch he would he would have done I didn\\'t need anything but he would have done anything now it\\'s what the prisoner toast no doctor give me a break give me a break find out how much money did I give a raise to Chuck Schumer and Chuck give all that money back please carolyn maloney give that money back every penny should come back they act so pompous they act so righteous and not righteous and I\\'d register bad people the far-left Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now Democrats are pushing a socialist takeover of health care that will take away your coverage and take away your doctor a hundred and eighty million people are going to lose a lot of people here now have health care finally under us that\\'s phenomenal and that\\'s what you want they want to take into a hundred and eighty they want you to go to a hospital ward someplace and sit there all night I don\\'t think so not in this group and you know what some people it\\'s good some people but can you imagine they want to take away a hundred and eighty million people great private highly negotiated health care where you have your own doctor remember Obama twenty eight times times twenty eight times you can have your doctor you can have your plan didn\\'t work out that way did it I think we should impeach him for that listen Peter for that for the IRS scandal for the guns remember the guns who has given him to anybody that wanted them he gave guns to the worst people in the world and then they didn\\'t have them registered right that too good impeach him why did the Republicans impeach him those were really how about giving Iran one point eight billion in cash by the way I ended the Iran nuclear deal I hope you have much different country but how about giving Iran one point eight billion dollars in cash many big planes going over to a rent loaded up to the ceiling with cash you know at one point eight billion you ever see like at a casino a million dollars wrapped up it\\'s a big pile of stuff that\\'s a million now multiply it one point eight billion dollars in cash she gave so why does he allow to do that did anybody try and appease him for that everybody knew it was wrong Republicans will strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will protect your pre-existing physicians virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth right that is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extremely term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption and that\\'s what it is the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and the American Dream and that\\'s really what it is we\\'re also the party of the great Abraham Lincoln a lot of people forget that but we have to bring it to protect the health and safety of our citizens we awarded one hundred million dollars to improve water infrastructure in Flint how badly was Flint who was who are the geniuses that did that deal you have clean water coming into Flint they had to pay a very tiny little fee so instead they go into this horrible horrible really polluted water and the water comes out of there they spent hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people it hurt the people but we\\'re getting it fixed and I know your previous governor was a Republican but I was not a big fan of his I was now but I\\'m not a big fan of the one that can\\'t fix the potholes here we\\'re committed to ensuring America has the cleanest air in the cleanest water on planet Earth and that\\'s what it\\'s about it\\'s about clean air and it\\'s about clean beautiful water and it\\'s about keeping our industry not closing it because of the ridiculous parrot Paris climate Accord how\\'s Paris doing I don\\'t think - well how\\'s Paris doing with the yellow vests the yellow vests you know why because they raise gasoline prices so they could send the money all over the world the countries that the people in France never heard of that it\\'s not working out too well with lowering prices we\\'re lowering taxes we\\'re making it possible I mean look at look at gas prices now look at gas prices I recognize Israel\\'s true capital it opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights big deal for years you watched as your politicians apologized remember we don\\'t apologize now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Michigan you\\'re getting your auto industry [Applause] at stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation if you want your children to grow up a land of safety it\\'s really we want to land of safety justice well I don\\'t know when I look at those f5 FBI reports we got out we gotta clean up a lot what they\\'ve done to hurt people what they\\'ve done to hurt with Comey and these horrible people what they\\'ve done to hurt people I think one of the best things I did as president a lot of people would say you know with all what we\\'ve done for the economy in it but what are the best thing is firing James commis ass out of it Reuters reports our cup did you see the other day well first time now he said in other words he\\'s 50% there folks he\\'s hit the Golden Pond anyway so what we\\'re doing is we\\'re doing things that are gonna make our victory and you know it\\'s like a tree we need that extra four years we\\'ve done so much even right to try you know right to try people were traveling that terminally ill they\\'re traveling all over the world we have the best medical in the world the best doctors the best labs best Hospital they\\'re traveling all over the world right to try and get because it takes years to get something approved and I said wait a minute folks why are we doing this and they\\'ve been trying to do it for 49 years they couldn\\'t get it done not that easy the drug companies didn\\'t want the liability the country didn\\'t want the liability the insurance companies didn\\'t want the lab I said here\\'s what we do we\\'ll sign an agreement with the people where your as a sculpt from all liability ha that\\'s a good idea and it\\'s a very strong agreement so we can\\'t get sued but I said listen you know they were worried they\\'re gonna hurt people they said these people are terminally ill they terminally ill and so we do it now nine months ago all the legislate at the 49 years so if somebody\\'s sick they don\\'t have to go to Asia they\\'re not to go to Europe or if you\\'re poor you go home and you now what happens very simple you sign that document they work it out you wouldn\\'t believe how many lives are being saved to cry to credible I\\'m very proud of it right to try I hope you don\\'t need it you don\\'t want it you don\\'t want it okay but if you do it\\'s there with your help we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity [Music] together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration we will enact the greatest trade deals ever made they\\'ll result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine what we\\'re doing is unbelievable we\\'re so far ahead of everybody what we\\'ve done in the last three years with the FDA and even the speed of of what we\\'re doing it would take twelve thirteen fourteen years to get things approved it\\'s down to a much smaller number but we\\'re finding new cures for childhood cancer and we are ending the AIDS epidemic in America we\\'ve started the process who would have thought that in ten years it\\'s a 10-year process we will have ended the AIDS epidemic in America and it could have been started before I came to office it was just wasted time we will defend privacy free speech free assembly religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms [Applause] above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement they\\'re incredible and that includes ice you know how tough these people are these are great Patriots they love our country even the sheriffs alone for some of the people that they\\'re dealing with these guys walk into they call them a nest and in some cases they just start swinging it they could have it they loved it these are great if we didn\\'t have them and I told you before they take it out bad bad bad people by the thousands especially ms-13 gang members who\\'s gonna do that who\\'s gonna do that anybody in the front row I don\\'t know what about you you\\'re a tough guy you might do it you could do it I don\\'t know you might yeah yeah you could would you like we\\'re gonna recruit you I think you guys you could handle yourself now he\\'s a tough people right you got to be tough then they get accused of too tough on it too tough you have some of these guys say nice people they don\\'t even need a gun because it\\'s more painful they knife the two young girls 16 years old beautiful they cut him up into pieces because it was more painful than shooting them these are animals and then Nancy Pelosi said I shouldn\\'t use the term animal and by the way she ought to go home and take care of her district where the homeless is all over the place and the tents and the filth and the garbage is eroding right into the Pacific Ocean and into their beaches she ought to go take care of her sir district and said did you see what\\'s going on and it rains and it\\'s filth and its needles and it\\'s drugs and it\\'s you know what it\\'s everything and it goes right into those storm sewers storm not sanitary storm and it goes right out into the Pacific to the beaches and we find San Francisco and Los Angeles and San Francisco but we\\'ve just said them a tremendous dollar fine for what they\\'re doing and Nancy Pelosi is playing games she had to go home and take care of the homeless and take care of the filth and everything San Francisco was the most beautiful city when you look at what\\'s happened with the tents all over the place where the police officers are getting sick just from walking the beat they\\'re getting sick diseases are coming back that this world hasn\\'t seen for 30 40 50 years it\\'s a disgrace she had to get back and take care of her district instead of wasting time for this nonsense we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government bureaucracy or the true American Way we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag [Applause] and we live by the words of our national motto and it\\'s always gonna be up there you know they want to take everything down they don\\'t want Thomas Jefferson anymore they don\\'t want anything that\\'s a terrible thing that we fight for it now we fight these words will never be taken off I don\\'t care where I am if I\\'m up there if I\\'m down here I don\\'t know but we\\'ll be fighting we\\'ll never take these words off In God We Trust [Applause] we stand on the shoulders of generations of michigan patrons who gave their blood sweat and tears for this beloved nation this is the state where henry ford invented the assembly line it\\'s the place where General Motors Chrysler and Kellogg transformed the nation it gave us Motown the Mustang and the might of the American Midwest this is the American Midwest and Michigan is the state with generations of strong tough and proud American workers made this into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world and we are making it bigger better and stronger than ever before by far loyal citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country we are returning power to you the American people the Democrats took the people of Michigan for granted but with us you will never be forgotten again the Forgotten men and women of this country will never ever be forgotten again and I\\'m fighting for

it because we\\'re doing the thing and look what we\\'re doing is we\\'re bringing back our country again well-respected again we\\'re respectable we are so respected you don\\'t even know how we spent you know I went today know where we were being ripped off because the other countries you have 29 countries and the other countries weren\\'t paying their bills they were delinquent you know in rose state I noticed people are using that word I\\'ve been using it for the last year it\\'s like a real estate turn that\\'s when they don\\'t pay their rent right well they weren\\'t paying and you have to see this chart until I got there they got a pay and they said well does that mean you won\\'t protect us they said you don\\'t want the answer to that question over the last and the Secretary General Stoltenberg over the last period of just two years I raised not from us nothing from us a hundred and thirty billion dollars but that\\'s nothing and over a short period of time they will be paying five hundred and thirty billion dollars more all of those my biggest fan in the world is Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO he says I never thought this could I\\'m telling you if you look it\\'s like 15 years just down President Obama would go to that make a speech I\\'d like to thank everybody for being here thanks a lot great job sayonara bye Bush they all did nobody ever asked for money we were spending for a hundred percent of NATO we\\'re protecting Europe they rip us off for trade right they rip us off like crazy we lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade we\\'re changing that but it\\'s a long time you know it\\'s been going on a long time they don\\'t take your product they don\\'t take your cars they don\\'t take your farm product they don\\'t take your medical machines we do a big business they sell us we don\\'t sell them because they put restrictions we have better equipment than them but they make it so that our equipment doesn\\'t qualify you know it\\'s called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers it\\'s brutal what they do I\\'m telling you they\\'re as bad as China just smaller they are as bad as China just smaller and now China\\'s doing great we\\'re very happy but we have to do something with that we have to take care of our people we can\\'t be ripped off by these countries so NATO is ripping us off militarily but now they\\'re starting to pay big money and that\\'s good we want to help them we want to be there with them but they have to pay they have to pay five hundred and thirty billion dollars and the fake news doesn\\'t won\\'t even talk about it they don\\'t want to talk about it they talk about other things they don\\'t want to talk about that when you get a chance though you know it\\'s a couple of weeks maybe you could say over a short period of time NATO countries will be paying five hundred and thirty billion dollars more more not total more how\\'s that good that\\'s not too bad nobody else could do that I guarantee I won\\'t tell you what took place in those close to our meetings some of them don\\'t like me you know they like Obama Jeremy likes Obama a lot of these countries France they like Obama it\\'s embarrassing France France President Obama is more popular than President Roh well I should be I just tax their wine and champagne coming into a country because they\\'re ripping us off on the internet okay if I ever become more popular that means I\\'m not doing my job you should say he\\'s out there sure I could be loved in Germany I could be loved in Germany Oh

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you very much vice president Mike Pence great job you doing and hello Toledo we love Toledo you remember I was here a lot you remember 2016 what a year that was right and 2020 is going to be even better no doubt but I\\'m thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of Ohio and as we begin the new year our economy is booming wages are soaring workers are thriving and America\\'s future has never ever looked brighter with the envy of every country in the world we\\'ve created seven million brand new jobs since our election and we will soon be replacing the disaster known as and after with the incredible brand-new USMC a the historic victory for Ohio farmers workers and manufacturers but really a great victory for the United States it\\'s an incredible agreement you remember I came and I talked about I\\'d always talked about how bad our trade deals are we did a brand new one with Korea so now we have South Korea we just finished a big 140 billion dollars with Japan on January 15th we\\'re signing monster a big beautiful monster forty to fifty billion dollars to our farmer that\\'s our farmers will be taken in I keep saying go by larger tractors go by larger tractors I said there\\'s no way I don\\'t know if you know the story my people wanted twenty billion of purchase right twenty business 20 that\\'s a lot of money to us a lot of corn twenty billion dollars and I said make it fifty China\\'s very big and they said ok they said sir the farmers can\\'t produce that much I said let the farmers tell me that tell them to go out remember and buy a bigger wad tractor buy a bigger tractor you\\'re producing so forty to fifty billion dollars of agricultural product and the manufacturers and the car companies and we brought a lot of car companies into Ohio you know that a lot of overcoming in a lot of them have already been brought in they\\'re coming in from Japan they\\'re coming in from all over the world this is where they want to be they want to be in the United States that\\'s where the action is they\\'re all coming back I used to go around talk about how everyone\\'s leaving they were all leaving a lot of you are victims of that leaving these companies would leave that go to Mexico they\\'d go to Canada they\\'d close up that buy from China now they\\'re all coming back new ones old ones they\\'re all coming back and many are coming right here to Ohio and just in case you didn\\'t know it Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state that\\'s not bad and this year is going to be even better and maybe much better but weeks ago I signed the largest ever investment in the United States military 738 billion dollars and we created the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces the space force and everybody\\'s excited about the after years and years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the United States military some of it still coming in we have everything we\\'ve got new planes we\\'ve got new rockets new missiles we\\'ve got new everything and it\\'s either here or coming in 2.5 trillion dollars in new investments our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before if you remember three years ago when I took over we were depleted our military was totally depleted and by the way speaking of our military have we taken care of our vets with choice choice with choice that was a big thing you know I used to go around and the VA was a terrible situation people would wait weeks he\\'s right he said yes it was you don\\'t hear too much about that anymore do you notice choice and accountability you know what accountability is for 44 years they tried to get accountability that somebody bad works for the VA you couldn\\'t fire him you couldn\\'t fire him they could be sadistic they could be thieves they could be whatever they were you couldn\\'t get rid of them we got accountability approved and now we say you\\'re fired get out we get somebody that\\'s forty-four years and maybe most importantly of all is choice VA veterans choice so now you wait online and a lot of times you\\'d be waiting in line for four five six weeks you couldn\\'t see a doctor now if you have to wait you go out to a private doctor you get yourself taken care of we pay the bill what a difference it\\'s made what a difference this way you know when I was a little bit newer to this game [Applause] that\\'s okay there God dagger they go home to mommy going home to mama they going home to mommy - beautiful sight thank you security do we love law enforcement by the way so with the VA I used to go around say why don\\'t they do that why don\\'t these people why don\\'t they go to a private doctor work something out and I thought it was a brilliant plan I said I\\'m telling you I am such a smart guy I said this is the most brilliant thing ever and I went back to my people and I said you don\\'t have an idea a veteran sick they can\\'t get the kind of service they need or they need a certain kind of a doctor I have an idea such a great idea you\\'re gonna go out private you\\'re gonna pick up a doctor you\\'re gonna get yourself fixed up we\\'re gonna pay the bill right and you know what happened and I said how how brilliant is that they say sir we\\'ve been working on that for forty-eight years but we\\'ve never been able to get it approved I was very very disillusioned but you know what I\\'m good at getting things approved that we got it approved so we signed that 11 months ago and what a difference that\\'s made in terms of your lines and in terms of people\\'s health people would wait on line for weeks and some people weren\\'t very sick and that end up being terminally ill they couldn\\'t get to see a doctor now they go out they get a doctor we take care of them we take care of our vets so we\\'re using this great power not to pursue conflict but to really preserve and I mean in the true sense of the word preserve peace we have this tremendous military and you know what that is that\\'s really a great fighting force but I hope we never have to use it I really do you saw an example you saw an example of that a couple of days ago so we seek friends not on Ray\\'s but if you dare to threaten our citizens you do so at your own grave peril we\\'ve never had we\\'ve never had a military what we have now we\\'ve never had anything like it you know we were looking at planes that were old and tired 50 60 year old planes you\\'ve heard the story the grandfather flew him the son phloem the current wonderful person flew him the whole family flew him those are all gone now folks those are all gone in October of last year US special operations forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the bloodthirsty founder and leader of Isis the animal known as al Baghdadi is dead and the entire Isis Caliphate is destroyed and his terrorist empire and he was indeed a monster has been totally demolished we killed thousands and thousands of Isis warriors fighters and we have thousands of them right now locked up where they should be nobody has ever done what we\\'ve done in three years and I\\'ll say this when we took it over it was a mess we did it in a short period of time but when we took it over it was not good and last week the United States once again took the bold and decisive action to save American lives and deliver American justice and you know what I\\'m talking about [Applause] for years the sadistic battery kasam salamati planned and executed attacks against American targets killing and wounding thousands of US service members and many many thousands and even hundreds of thousands of other people as the leader of Iran\\'s terrorist cuts force Salah mani spread death destruction and mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond he ordered the violent assault on the American Embassy in Baghdad and you saw this was the anti Benghazi we got there very quickly we got there very quickly this is the exact opposite we did it exactly the opposite of Benghazi where they got there so late all they saw when they got there days later we\\'re burning embers from days before all they saw we got there very early we saw what was happening I saw what was happening I said what\\'s that all about and that was going to be another Benghazi had they broken through the final panels of glass they were breaking it breaking it had they gotten through we would have had either hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages that wasn\\'t going to happen and I called up our great generals I said get him over there now [Applause] and one of our leaders one of our really admired people said sir we\\'ll have them there tomorrow I said nope get in the planes right now have them there immediately and they got there Romania fortunately but he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four American servicemembers badly wounded and killed an American citizen that was just before we happened to hit him Salamone was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in Baghdad but we stopped him and we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold so in my direction the United States military eliminated Qasem Soleimani and ended his rampage through not only that part of the world but much bigger parts of the world he was all over he was a bad guy he was a bloodthirsty terror and he\\'s no longer a terror he\\'s dead and yet now I see the radical left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist and you know instead they should be outraged by Salamone savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long yeah he was the king of the roadside bomb you know at the roadside bomb and then they got bigger and he\\'d send them over to Afghanistan and Iraq and when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and a great warriors when you see them without their legs without an arm and with so much damage it\\'s most likely that he caused that damage because that\\'s what he liked he loved planting the roadside bomb so now he\\'s gone and that\\'s a good Bernie Sanders crazy burning has condemned the US military strike on Sal Ronnie the world\\'s top terrorist think of it the world\\'s top terrorists and we\\'re having people like Nancy Pelosi ERDs a real genius [Applause] you believe that one Nancy Nancy nervous Nancy [Applause] but here\\'s the guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and and military whoever was in his way and we have birdie and Nancy Pelosi we have them all they\\'re all trying to say how dare you take him out that way you should get permission from Congress you should come in and tell us what you want to do you should come in and tell us so that we can call up the fake news it\\'s back there and we can leak that\\'s a lot of that\\'s a lot of corruption back there from [Applause] I don\\'t know but think seriously so they want me so you know these are split-second decisions you have to make a decision so that it won\\'t be to make that decision they want me to call up maybe go over there let me go over to conquer so come on over to the White House let\\'s talk about it when can you make it well I won\\'t be able to make it today sir how about let\\'s say it a couple of days oh sure come on over now we got a call we heard where he was we knew the way he was getting there and we had to make a decision we didn\\'t have time to call up Nancy who is not operating with a full deck now they want us to call can you imagine calling crooked Adam chef is so crooked shifty she\\'ll say see Adam how you do it listen we have the world\\'s number one terrorist killed thousands and thousands of people would like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution would would you be willing to me well I won\\'t be able to make it this week well you know he\\'s traveling fast we got him lined up Adam you little pencil neck [Applause] 9 inches he buys the smallest shirt-collar you can get and it\\'s loose now come on Adam we got to meet faster Adam we kind of lined up we got to take this guy out we\\'re not gonna have another shot at a baby ever again but but I can\\'t make it now because I\\'m trying to impeach Trump I\\'m trying to open even though he did nothing wrong by the way did you say I did nothing wrong they don\\'t even know what the hell is going on in fact it\\'s so weak she doesn\\'t want to put in the articles it\\'s so weak they\\'re so pathetic they\\'re so pathetic so they want us to call them now Schiff is a big leaker you know he leaks too crazy CNN see with a little red light on [Applause] not too many people are watching CNN but he leaks so he\\'ll say they\\'re now off the record I gotta hurry up because everyone\\'s watching me in the hallway of my cell phone off the record they\\'ve got the number one terrorist in the world Salah Moni and they\\'re gonna get him they\\'re gonna take him out in the next ten minutes ah please don\\'t tell anybody I told you but then so yeah we are breaking this president Trump within the next 20 25 minutes looks to be taking a terrorist general Soleimani he\\'s gonna do it should be happening about the next 20 minutes 19 18 17 then we get back to the battlefield how\\'d you do fellas I don\\'t know sir he disappeared I don\\'t know what happened to him they want us to they want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media [Applause] you got to say though that\\'s a lot of media right that\\'s the way the Academy Awards used to look what it was successful then they started hitting us all the time and it became unsuccessful I love it I love it actually Oh to have some bad ones into me they have some really bad ones some real sick ones that one good one by the way one good one I have one googly butts abandons very very dishonest people and we have some great ones still you know we have some great journalists great reporters but you\\'ve got a tremendous number of dishonest media people like I have never seen in my life before they write things that they know are wrong they write if you watch for the last three years think of it and then they get Pulitzer Prizes but it turned out to be all wrong how do you do that they get Pulitzer Prizes for being wrong the Pulitzer Prize doesn\\'t mean a thing doesn\\'t mean a thing I mean I\\'m here to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize I\\'ll tell you about that I made a deal I saved a country and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country I said what did I have something to do with it yeah but you know that so it is as long as we know that\\'s all that matters okay I saved a big war saved a couple of them but under my administration we will never make excuses for America\\'s enemies we will never hesitate in defending American lives and we will never stop working to defeat radical Islamic terrorism and nobody\\'s done it like we\\'ve done it and it\\'s we it\\'s we it\\'s not me and so we it\\'s a whole movement there is by the way never been a movement like this you know outside I don\\'t know what this place holds like ten eleven thousand people right outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in there\\'s never been a movement like this there\\'s never been a and I\\'ll tell you baby I\\'m wrong but this is bigger than it was in 2016 because because in 2016 I said what we\\'re going to do but now I\\'ve completed more promises that I\\'ve made I mean I\\'ve actually completed more right [Applause] like as an example many of you were here leave it all those beautiful red hats keep America great that\\'s good but I never talked about did you ever hear be prior to the election talk about space force never talked about it we did space was but did we ever speak about it no there were many things that we\\'ve done that we never spoke about right right to try you know about right to try right they\\'ve been trying to get it for 44 years right to try that\\'s people that are very sick terminally ill and they can\\'t get medicine that possibly works and very well we have the greatest labs the greatest doctors in the world greatest scientists and the world with the greatest medicines in the world if they have something that they\\'re pretty sure is gonna work but it\\'s going to take another six years I brought those times way back by the way way down but they were travel to Asia they would travel to Europe they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldn\\'t sell them the medicine because we didn\\'t want to take a chance on making the people sick I said wait a minute they\\'re gonna die they\\'re going to die well sir we can\\'t take the liability I said then we\\'ll drop a statement assessing all liability taking all liability away from the country away from the insurance companies away from the health care companies away from the doctors and with the great help of a lot of incredible Republicans and we had some Democrats help us we passed right to try and you have to see how this is worked some people are being many people are being saved and you know the drug companies didn\\'t like it because they didn\\'t want to take people that sick because they didn\\'t want it on their charts I said I understand that that we won\\'t include that will have a separate list over here they said oh would you do that I said y\\'all do that I\\'ll do that but I didn\\'t talk about right to try I\\'ve never said I was gonna get that done and we got it done that was a tough one to get done sounds simple it was tough there\\'s nothing easy in this country no they said to me in front of my the other day who\\'s the toughest country to deal with president he used to call me Donald I\\'ve known this guy for a long time I like to say 20 years but it\\'s much more than that I just don\\'t want to tell you how long it\\'s too long and I say call me Donald you\\'ve always called me Donald I can\\'t he calls me mr. president they\\'ve known this guy forever he used to call me hey Don let\\'s go out to dinner you know before he go hey let\\'s go out to dinner now he goes mr. president sir how are you right how are you but what we\\'ve done and he said he called me he said what you\\'ve done he\\'s never seen anything like it so many people are saying that we are all together doing something not only in terms of the election not only in terms of what we\\'re doing right now don\\'t forget it\\'s a long way to the election you know we have what 10 months that\\'s a long way this is my first stop of the year first major south of this is it and we stuck by the way let\\'s do one of those polls right now do you mind but is there anything more fun than a trump rally here we are so we have the greatest phrase of all time make America great again and in all due respect I\\'ll never add up little superstitious I\\'ll never end it make America great again but I see all those hats I see all those hats changing it a little bit but make America great again and I said you know today we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country so your 401k so your 401ks or at breakfast your socks are great but what it really means to me is jobs more importantly than anything else we have the best jobs the best everything right but we just hit so I can\\'t really say make America great again our military is rebuilt two and a half trillion our military is rebuilt we\\'re doing great numbers economically our countries the strongest it\\'s ever been you have factories moving back into Ohio you never saw anything like it right you had your best year so when I say make America great again what that sort of means it\\'s like we didn\\'t get there but we did get there so now I have a new theme it\\'s called keep America red keep America [Applause] I\\'m a very loyal person and I am concerned about changing the theme because make America great again I think it was the greatest political campaign in history I mean crooked Hillary spent three or four times more money than us right so crooked Hillary way crooked that you should lock her up I\\'ll tell you crooked Hillary spent three or four times more so I want to be a little bit you know I have to say that was a great campaign and I don\\'t want to change it I don\\'t want to have this incredible 2016 then go with something and if something ever happened all this country will go to hell I hate to say you know the stocks I\\'m talking about records you\\'ll have records this way you\\'re gonna have records get used to it because if that happened you will see things happen that aren\\'t good but I have to now say do I want to change the greatest theme in political history make America great again with Keep America great right so so let\\'s take a little applause right we\\'ll go make America great again you clap if you want that there we go keep America great you\\'d laugh if you like that okay you ready first make America great again ready Keep America great so you know that yeah I call that a free pole that\\'s better than a pole you ever see these crazy poles they come out we\\'re doing great in the poles by the way remember I used to come out and talk about the pulse we\\'ll start doing that very soon we\\'re doing great in the poles but this is like a free pole somebody else would go out they have all this money that they raised and they give somebody a million dollars and they\\'ll ask 200 people that question and then they\\'ll say well make America great again is better but I will tell you I haven\\'t heard one thing when that was true with all of these I one of us I would have said instinctively make America great again could not be beaten I probably done this ten times I have never had it win it\\'s keep America great and that\\'s what we\\'re doing but we\\'re gonna use both we\\'re going to use both we\\'re going to use because there\\'s no way that I\\'m gonna jettison make America great again right there\\'s no way we\\'re gonna use both but this hat is a hot seller we\\'re selling that hat like nobody\\'s ever sold a hat before I will say good Keep America great so we\\'re gonna use both but Keep America great that\\'s probably gonna be the dominant theme for eight years the Obama administration enabled and embolden the Iranian regime they gave Iran 150 billion dollars including 1.7 billion dollars in hard cold cash can you imagine no no can you imagine 1.7 1.8 billion dollars in cash [Applause] so the foolish Iran nuclear deal financed Iranian aggression while allowing a quick path to nuclear breakout that\\'s what it did and by the way it expires so soon they can have nuclear weapons then not as I said before they will not have nuclear weapons by subsidizing Iran\\'s malign conduct the last administration was leading the world down the path of war we are restoring our world to the path of peace peace through strength peace through strength and our countries doing great and I think something\\'s gonna happen that\\'s got to be good you know we sanctioned the hell out of Iran and we just put morale yesterday they hit us with 16 missiles and I said how many we were ready to go we were ready to go I said how many how many died how many were wounded sir none no pretty good warning system none how many were hurt how would it none sir so we didn\\'t do anything we were ready we were ready not that I wanted to but we were ready you

woman who really has become a great friend of mine she took over this party we fought like hell we had some other people that had their mind and taken over the party but they never had a chance against Jane Timken Jane and the man who was in charge of my campaign in Ohio I had a choice of five people I said I like this guy\\'s name I don\\'t know why it\\'s name is Bob padieu chick why do I like his name and I said Bob how are we doing you said you\\'re gonna win Big Sur because you know you keep hearing you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio that\\'s these guys and once I was leading Ohio by a lot in the poll they never said that any more it\\'s terrible they were saying it when they thought I wasn\\'t going to win but we were ahead right from the beginning but Bob was incredibly did a fantastic job and Bob I\\'d call him up I\\'d say Bob we don\\'t have the governor we don\\'t have the head of the Republican Party you know it\\'s a minor problem you\\'re running as a Republican and he punked out on us right this guy we don\\'t have any he said sure you have the people I said well what happens I said so Bob let me ask you just out of curiosity I don\\'t have these people the leaders are not with us is that good or bad he said sir it\\'s great you just went up three points you believe this why not have it and he said don\\'t worry sir you gonna win it we won by a lot and now I understand we\\'re up by a lot more than we ever thought possible but Bob was fantastic thank you Bob and thanks to Republican leadership work can you believe this I have a 95 percent approval rating can you believe and you know who second is we do we do we do you know second this Ronald Reagan at 87% of Bronner of Ronald Reagan\\'s and then one of these characters back there they put me in a contest with the late great Abraham Lincoln right so who do you like better Trump or Abraham Lincoln I said Abraham Valka [Applause] sighs oh no do you like bad as they say they did Apollo on this I think I remember the numbers all I know is we want to get stay bruh ham Honest Abe we won 53 to 47 you believe that Abraham Lincoln I went back to the first lady I said first lady I just beat Abraham Lincoln in a party I don\\'t know if they had poles back there but Abraham Lincoln I always say I can be more presidential than any candidate that ever ran than any president other than maybe Abraham Lincoln what he\\'s wearing his hat but I like Abe Lincoln but we\\'re doing well we have a lot of support you know why because our country is doing so well our country is doing so and when we went out we started and we went right to the top of the polls it wasn\\'t like these folks today there are two percent three percent but they\\'re climbing we went right to the top from day one we never miss center stage in the debates remember those great debates we actually got high ratings they don\\'t get very good ratings anymore they\\'re like it\\'s like death watching I should watch you know I\\'m supposed to watch just like my job try and watch watch the competition but it\\'s like watching death those debates are boring they\\'re boring you got to sit through those things for two or three hours you got to really be committed to the country to do that I mean you have some real beauties you see what Pocahontas is slipping badly [Applause] and Bernie Bernie is going up he\\'s surgeon bernie is crazy Bernie he\\'s surging and Biden doesn\\'t know the difference between Iran and Iraq he\\'s gotten it wrong four times - he goes when we took our shot at a record I know they were all saying no no they\\'re screaming it\\'s Iran Iran ah what that his son right where\\'s hunter wears huh [Applause] I went to one of them I said we have to have where\\'s hunter as a witness they said what do you mean where\\'s hunter I said that\\'s his first name I have now made his first name where\\'s where\\'s hunter here\\'s a guy made no money got thrown out of the military forces I think the Navy got thrown out had no job had no nothing so it went from that to making millions of dollars a year as soon as sleepy Joe became vice president right he made millions of dollars a year would anybody in this room do that for millions is that I would we all he made millions and millions of dollars a year Ukraine took care of him how about China he walked out with 1.5 billion to manage and he never did it before he didn\\'t know anything about oil and gas he was making a fortune so where\\'s hunter where the hell are you hunter but I\\'ll tell you I sort of hope it\\'s Joe because he will here where\\'s hunter every single debate nine times at the park [Applause] we\\'re sorry and then you have Buddha touch who the ditch food agents I kept nobody nobody can pronounce nobody has any idea how to help us instead so what they do is they call a mere Pete you know you know like mayor Pete here comes mayor Pete doesn\\'t do a very good job Alfred even when you\\'re right howdy doody some people\\'s Howdy Doody Howdy Doody probably\\'s a lot of people don\\'t remember Alfred e Newman don\\'t say that you look much younger than that I must say so you have mayor Pete I mean give me a break can you believe me Pete this is gonna be the President of the United States this is gonna be how would he be against negotiating against President Xi of China and we just made one hell of a deal oh you\\'re gonna see the numbers very soon you know they didn\\'t like those tariffs thanks to Republican leadership america\\'s winning again and america most importantly is respected again respected like never before and you know for years NATO has taken advantage of the United States we protect Europe from Russia and it the numbers have been going down for many many years 15 years 18 years the numbers is like a roller coaster down and I went over and I said foes you got to pay your bills you delinquent you know you\\'re delinquent and then they don\\'t like me they say we like Obama better they should like Obama better Obama would go in and say thank you very much for coming appreciate it bye bye I\\'m going back to Washington I\\'m going back I\\'ll be violating the carbon footprint I\\'m going to Hawaii to play golf I Drive to play around a golfer to course a young doesn\\'t even cost them anything he flies away nobody cares if I Drive 20 minutes it\\'s like Donald Trump is plague off today he violates the carbon footprint but but just think of it think of think of where we\\'ve come think of where we\\'ve come a great congressman from Tennessee they have it\\'s a great state they have early voting very early voting probably the earliest that he said I don\\'t know I just left I just left Tennessee this was on in November this was the election 2016 he said I just left this incredible state of mine I love that state sir we\\'ve seen lines of people that didn\\'t vote before because they never were inspired to vote and these are people that never voted and they had hats on Trump they have pins on Trump Trump Trump pants they have the band\\'s own you know like a Miss Universe boom it says Trump pence and they\\'ve got buttons all over they\\'ve got shirts saying Trump and Trump beds I never saw anything like it if every state is like Tennessee sir I hate to tell you you\\'re gonna have one hell of a victory and that\\'s what happened right and you did it you did it and I think we\\'re gonna have bigger numbers even bigger numbers because I\\'ll tell you what we\\'re a long way from the election I think the crowds today are bigger than they were the day before the election [Applause] you know Elizabeth Warren sadly referred to she of great Indian heritage remember I used to say I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have none I turned out to be right but but you look at what she\\'s doing you look at what she\\'s saying the lies the deceit the fraud you see it all we are going to do so great it\\'s going to be something that\\'s going to be special it\\'s going to be for the record books the evangelicals called some of the greatest pastors ministers preachers and they just called today five of the most respected people and they said things that were incredible they said there\\'s never been anything like this in the church that they can read some of them have been doing it for 30 40 years they said we have never seen enthusiasm like we see for this president and for this presidency all of us like we have right now and the great Franklin grain Billy Graham\\'s son Franklin Graham a fantastic man he said two weeks ago my father Billy Graham voted for Donald Trump nobody ever no no nope he never said that before Billy Graham wasn\\'t somebody that would vote and say he vote Franklin Graham said Billy Graham maybe the greatest of all maybe the greatest of all time he said my father Billy Graham who was very old at the time and in trouble he was in trouble he was not well he voted for Donald Trump what a great tribute that was to man what a great family unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 51 years african-american Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates ever ever ever recorded [Applause] wages are rising fast they\\'re going up very fast and the biggest percentage increase makes me happy or for blue-collar workers 40 a million think of this 40 million American families are now benefiting from the Republican child tax credit each receiving an average of over $2,200 a year now America lost this is hard to believe because if you think how could it possibly be true but this is what happened probably it\\'s the reason number one reason I\\'m running America lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration 60,000 you wouldn\\'t believe that\\'s possible but I know it\\'s true because I\\'ve said it 50 times and the fakers back there they\\'ve never corrected me now it\\'s oh it sure if I were slightly off if it were if I was off by two factors there\\'d be a headline Donald Trump told of him Donald Trump gets to be a Pinocchio again no think of it 60,000 factories plants and factories closed closed they went to Mexico they went to China the 60,000 it\\'s not even I look take a look at a map and put 60,000 a little tax I mean you wouldn\\'t believe it could be that many but it is it\\'s 60,000 close gun they\\'re all coming back they\\'re all coming back and right now just in a very short period of time we\\'ve added 12,000 brand new factories and many more coming in and one of the reasons they\\'re coming in as we\\'ve eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations saving the average American household $3,000 a year and total income gains for median households will reach over ready $10,000 a family now under the Bush administration for $10,000 that includes what we\\'ve done in terms of medium income I\\'m adding in there the tax cuts which are tremendous $2,400 Anna Manning regulation consummating the whole package over $10,000 now under President Bush it was four hundred and fifty dollars under Barack Hussein Obama it was nine hundred and seventy five dollars under President Donald J Trump it\\'s ten thousand hours in three years don\\'t forget President Bush eight years four hundred and fifty dollars President Obama eight years nine hundred and seventy-five dollars President Trump three years not even not even not even but three years ten thousand dollars we\\'re going up we\\'re going up we ended the last administration\\'s war on American energy and we ended the war on clean beautiful coal is being shipped to Vietnam it\\'s being shipped all over the world well every Democrat running for president wants to shut down our coal mines we are putting our miners back to work dig we must dig women clean coal what they do with call today is incredible clean coal and with the help of energy workers right here in Ohio the United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far we\\'re number one every top Democrat candidate has pledged to eliminate American production of oil and natural gas how does that work by the way you know there\\'s a state donors Texas and I won Texas by a lot just like I won Ohio by a lot how would you like to go into Texas and say by the way we don\\'t want your oil or natural gas anymore how about bado remember he said I was born to be President anybody that says that I said that\\'s the end of his career remember he had the cover of the magazine I won\\'t mention the magazine sleazebag magazine he was born to be President and right after that he came tumbling down but he\\'s from Texas so he was against religion he was against oil and he was against guns Abraham Lincoln could not win in Texas with that platform that\\'s not a good platform it\\'s not a good platform but you have people they want to shut down the oil industry and if you do that you\\'re gonna shut down half of your business is really more than that and the rest of them are not gonna be able to pay because the cost of this energy would be so expensive so we have all forms of energy we have every form of energy and we are doing great but they want to cripple your state\\'s economy but the voters of Ohio will never let the never gonna let it happen and our air and our water right now is cleaner than it\\'s been in 40 years and sadly I can\\'t say historic because you know a couple of hundred years ago there was nobody here right so I assumed that two three hundred years ago was cleaner probably you never know but our water and our air is as clean as it\\'s ever been and I took us out of that horrible Paris Accord I always say how you doing with the Paris Accord don\\'t ask save trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us in my opinion it was put in there to hurt us we were paying money to India we were paying money to China China\\'s didn\\'t kick in till 2030 we kicked in immediately we had to pay money Russia kicked in in 20 let\\'s say they kicked in before they were nineteen ninety eight there were nineteen ninety-six that was a very dirty period of their so they didn\\'t have we kick in now and that it\\'s just unacceptable we would have spent trillions and trillions of dollars we would have had a close up I think at least 25 to 30 percent of our businesses who the hell would make a deal like that right who would make a deal like that know how unfair you look at Russia you look at China you look at India they all got these massive breaks we got no breaks and what paying money and I say sometimes to France how are the yellow vests working out because they don\\'t like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that they never heard of so we are in good shape it took a certain amount of courage to do that I said I\\'m gonna get killed on this one and you know what I did it and I was applauded because the people get it the people know what we\\'re doing and they\\'re tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world they\\'re tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world for decades career politicians promised to defend the workers of Ohio and then they went to Washington and voted for the same globalists policies that devastated your communities and chipped away your jobs you know that better than anybody Ohio knows that but the betrayal of Ohio workers and US workers ended the day I took the oath of office and you see that because you set a record [Applause] I immediately cancelled the Obama administration\\'s job-killing catastrophe which would have dealt a death blow to the United States auto industry the trans-pacific partnership it was a disaster that was going to be worse than after NAFTA I always say the world worse deal I think that would have been worse it would have taken the car industrial would have taken many of your industries that was a set up for the United States to get fleeced the u.s. MCA will save the American auto industry create over 100,000 new auto jobs and our factories will not be closing and moving to other faraway lands we\\'ll keep them right here of that sort of thing and that\\'s going to include because we take care of our great auto workers of Toledo the home of Jeep how good is Jeep [Applause] and I\\'ve taken the toughest-ever action against China\\'s chronic trade abuses including tariffs on three hundred and seventy billion dollars worth of Chinese made Goods bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and I gave some of that money because they were targeted to our farmers and our farmers to just fine and now the deal is done and the other deals are done and the farmers are doing very well we love our farmers and they never complain they never complained you know when they\\'d go the fake news back there they\\'d go and they\\'d talk to the farmers what do you think the pros of the Trump China is deciding not to buy anymore this he said you know what the farmers would say we\\'re gonna have to suffer for a while because China and these other nations have been ripping us off for years the president is right and we\\'re with the president how greater then but our strong action paid off and we\\'ll sign that terrific and fully enforceable phase one trade deal with China and again we\\'re keeping the tariffs on because we\\'ll use that for another one we are taking billions - remember what I said we\\'re not paying for it because China devalued their currency and they put a lot of money into the pot we\\'re not paying for it and now they\\'re starting to say I guess he was right and our trade deficit as a result has considerably come substantially down it was just in the papers today the trade deficit has come down as a result of our actions steel mills all across Ohio you know this better than I do are roaring back to life jsw steel is investing 500 million dollars in Mingo junction Republic Steel is reopening the Lorraine mill that they idled in 2016 Charter Steel is building a 150 million dollar mill in Cuyahoga Heights and new core is investing 85 million dollars at a facility in Marion Ohio we cannot think of that the steel industry was dead and now it\\'s vibrant all told American steel companies are currently making thirteen billion dollars worth of new investments all across our nation think of that they weren\\'t investing ten cents the industry was dead now it\\'s vibrant after years of rebuilding other nations we are finally rebuilding our nation we are finally putting America first [Applause] but while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the Washington Democrats are wasting America\\'s time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts think of it from the day I came down that escalator it started who the hell else could have taken this stuff right do I get some credit for that most guys would have been in the corner with their thumb in their mouth saying mommy mommy take me home these are bad people the Democrat politicians were fighting today are the same ones who took a sledgehammer to Ohio jobs and factories they destroyed your factories they destroyed your jobs but they\\'re losing and we\\'re winning and America\\'s comeback continues full speed ahead or no issue have Democrat politicians were thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of illegal immigration far left radical politician support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their contempt scorn and disdain for everyday Americans and the American family these jurisdictions release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob attack and kill American citizens but we stop it they want open borders can you believe it and because of Democrats open border policies they want open borders they want people flowing come on in come on innocent Americans are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals as just one example right here in Ohio you all know about it an illegal alien one on a deadly crime spree attempting to rape a fourteen-year-old girl then raping and murdering a 60 year old woman then shooting another woman who took a shortcut through the park and was walking with her children and finally the police came we love our police and they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal thanks to Democrat policies ms-13 gang members they\\'re the worst were allowed to infiltrate the country you know I called them animals and Nancy Pelosi said they\\'re not animals they\\'re human beings take a look at what\\'s happening to her district her district is one of the most disgusting dirtiest it used to be one of the best in the country now it\\'s a disgrace what\\'s happened drug needles all over the place the homeless that they\\'re not taking care of tents down major thoroughfares what happened to San Francisco and in particular her district as she lives in this beautiful house but they terrorize our citizens including killing their victims with machetes ms-13 they kill them with machetes you know why because it\\'s more painful than using the gun federal authorities recently discovered and rounded up more than 20 vile ms-13 gang members in Central Ohio and they will be sent to jail or or frankly if they hold them I don\\'t know that they hold them they\\'re gonna be sent the hell back home last year alone ice officers who by the way are heroes these are brave people I don\\'t want to do it you don\\'t want to do it let\\'s say you could do it you could do it over there you can do most of you want none I mean I\\'ve seen it they have these people they\\'re like killers and our guys are here and they run they call them s7s and they run in there swinging and punch I say what the hell kind of a job is that that\\'s what they do they\\'re tough people they\\'re great Patriots who the hell wants to do it they\\'re incredible ice and they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of ms-13 members every single year they throw them into the back of a van and we get them the hell out of our country but ice office has worked with Ohio police to remove 1,200 dangerous criminal aliens from your straight and you know all your streets you see the difference now between what it is now do we have a problem over there go ahead take your time take your time good thank you great job thank you don\\'t forget these people here unlike you up there these people have been waiting for three days so they\\'re gonna be I don\\'t know you know what if I had to wait three days I think I like your seat better okay I like your seat belt but Democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos Republicans stand for law order and justice that\\'s really the way it is we side with law enforcement with law-abiding Americans not law breaking criminal aliens we are removing these illegal criminals and gang members from our country by the thousands we are sending them all and we will not let them back in and I have to tell you a lot of things are happening you\\'re gonna hear about it in two seconds thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border illegal crossings are down 75 percent since back we have ended catch-and-release tats and really general catchy releases we catch them we take down their neighbor we release him what kind of crap is that these are the the policies that we inherited you catch somebody you take their name say please come back in three years right and we release them into a country and if you don\\'t do that everybody gets sued can you believe this we have ended catch and release the other one beauty how about the lottery it\\'s called Visa Lottery how about this they put their hand these people are going to America pom and I will not use names because I\\'ll be accused of something about them but from Honduras Guatemala El Salvador we have his Facebook only in Ohio Cabana who is the man that did that book yes who is that so anyway but in Honduras Guatemala they have like this lottery now the people I\\'ve gotten to know the government officials they\\'re good we made some good things they agreed to take our people back you know their people back they wouldn\\'t take them back they\\'d send them here they go into our country we\\'d bring them back under past administrations and then after that they say we\\'re not taking it back we\\'re not taking it back take them the hell out of here we\\'re not letting you land your plane so we have a government flying a plane all trying to get a couple of prisoners bad people back now they take them back you know why because I said look if you don\\'t think I\\'m back we\\'re gonna put tariffs on every single thing that you sell it now they say we would love to take her back we would love to take her back we\\'ll take him back gladly sir no they way they couldn\\'t get him back would take over these absolute thugs these gang members I would bring her back and they wouldn\\'t accept him we couldn\\'t land the plane we couldn\\'t get anything through the border it comes through the border this way but not that way but now they take her back they\\'ve been great actually they\\'ve been really good that we paid them a lot of money we paid him a five hundred million dollars here can you believe we paid him five hundred million to three of them El Salvador included and I said look we\\'re not gonna pay any money anymore because you\\'re not treating us right and they\\'ve been great they\\'ve been great they take her back how many would you like us to take we\\'ll take as many as you want and here\\'s the big thing ready you ready today in the newspapers in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals we won the big big beautiful lawsuit where they were all suing us the wall is being built we built we\\'ve built already a tremendous amount but we\\'re releasing four billion dollars of military construction funds to build the biggest section of the wall it\\'s literally being signed now it\\'ll be under construction very shortly in a couple of weeks we\\'ve already built over a hundred miles of wall how about that hundred miles and by the end of next year we\\'re gonna have a lot of the wall built and it\\'s already having a big impact how about the Democrats wolves don\\'t work we want technology I said what are you gonna do they want drones so good when people are rushing the caravans when they\\'re rushing having a drone flying around there\\'s not gonna help you too much okay nothing like this well you know five years ago the Democrats all wanted the world they just could never get it built they didn\\'t know how to held a building I do so we built a hundred miles I think probably more than that now we have a lot under contract but we won our big case just I woke up they said Sarah we have good news they overturned a horrible decision from the lower court you can now fund the rest of the wall I said thank you very much Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals but they want to have open borders they want to have sanctuary cities the Radical Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now they are stone cold crazy you know it\\'s interesting as I\\'m saying this stuff you know they want crime they want chaos I\\'m saying all this stuff then I say change now I sort of understand why they hate me friend but it\\'s true it\\'s true their policies are a disaster they\\'re bad politicians and they have horrible policies but what they do they stick together and they\\'re vicious they\\'re vicious horrible people I didn\\'t used to say that they\\'re horrible people what they do to people is a disgrace but they stick together now the Republicans thank you very much the Republicans my man the Republicans we were 196 to nothing in the house and I have a feeling the Senate\\'s gonna be great also 196 to nothing and we took in three Democrat and Congressman Van drew left their party and joined our party so we\\'ve done things that nobody\\'s ever done before but the Democrats are taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders in that group Omar AOC to leave this is you a nice woman to leave to leave why Rotter group but they\\'re the leaders of the party they\\'re really in my opinion at least that\\'s what happened that\\'s how they got into this impeachment hoax the leaders of the party are this AOC Talib and Omar and Pelosi meets amici shakes and Quivers since she\\'s very nice but you know who the leader of your party is all of you you you\\'re the leader of your party but the Democrats are pushing the Socialists takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private insurance plans and massively raise taxes on the middle class a lot of you have private insurance plans that you love they\\'re gonna take him away from you but see I don\\'t like doing this too soon I did it with Pocahontas I came up with this great name I came up with a lot of different stuff I said she was a total fraud and everybody believed me and she went down then she started coming up then she went down it doesn\\'t help me to do it a year and a half before the election that\\'s why I\\'m like with the green New Deal okay I want to say great things about it okay I don\\'t want to knock it and then they say we\\'re not gonna use that I like it when they say no longer can you fly airplanes no longer can you have any cows in the pasture right no longer can we do anything we can\\'t do anything anymore no the green New Deal I love it I think it\\'s great it should be debated it should be debated so what we\\'re going to do very seriously we\\'re gonna not talk badly about them we\\'re gonna say the Greens they asked me about it the other day gentleman just says we better backstage I said no it\\'s something that has to be considered then about two weeks before the election I\\'ll let you know the facts because this doesn\\'t matter we\\'re too too far ahead of the election the green New Deal that\\'s a beauty you know it\\'s amazing that I see this congressman that\\'s been there he is white hair beautiful white hair no it\\'s not you and he\\'s with a or C and he\\'s saying yes we have to go with the green new deal and I\\'m saying is this guy for real I don\\'t know if he believes that he\\'s been around for twenty years in Congress I\\'ve seen him I know I\\'m a little bit and he\\'s acting like he actually believes it but we\\'re gonna just take our time and we\\'re gonna relax and about three four you gotta join some rallies about a month before you\\'re gonna hear the real facts but I\\'m tired of talking them out of things ten months before the election Bernie Sanders health care plan would cost over thirty two trillion dollars yeah that\\'s more money than we make in five years that\\'s more money than we\\'ll ever make he is indeed crazy no noise let me take that back no it\\'s a great plan that we have to consider strongly we have to consider his plan strongly now see I\\'ll tell you what the fake news will do they\\'ll take my last words it\\'s a great plan we have to consider it strongly they\\'ll cut everything out in the front and they\\'ll say Donald Trump is in favor of Bernie Sanders green New Deal they can do more with the tape than they can do with a newspaper now they\\'ll do that you\\'ll see it somewhere you\\'ll see it on Trump supports his plan they are sick Republicans will defend middle class taxpayers and the right to keep the doctor of your choice we will protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will protect your pre-existing physician you\\'ll have your physician virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s wolf right up until the moment of birth that is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God [Applause] radical Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and the party of the American dream we still have that American dream as of today we\\'ve appointed 187 federal judges to interpret the Constitution as written think of that and two great Supreme Court judges think of that 187 federal and Court of Appeals judges think of that Thank You President Obama he gave us a hundred and forty two judges thank you thank you very much President Obama we have a record it\\'s a record and we will appoint him anymore but we first day at 142 judges 142 I said how many do we have sir you have a hundred and forty-two I said you got to be kidding I thought it\\'s a maybe none maybe one but certainly no more than one they\\'re like gold they said no sir you have a hundred and forty-two I said you\\'ve got to be kidding how did this happen President Obama President Obama did not get that done and by the way Mitch helped a lot too I have to tell you Mitch helped a lot he helped a lot wasn\\'t so easy Mitch McConnell we\\'re aggressively combating the oily opioid epidemic and it\\'s bad in 2018 drug overdose deaths in Ohio fell by listen to this 22 percent it\\'s not good enough but 22 opioid and as we continue rebuilding our military we have resorted the legendary army tank Factory in Lima and we\\'ve authorized 441 new striker fighting combat vehicles and 453 new Abrams tanks to be built in the Buckeye State that\\'s a lot of thing so wait just a quick certain that okay I\\'m proud of this so they have this army tank plant right in the Lima and I said what\\'s going on they\\'re closing it he said oh they are you know they\\'re closing closing everything when I came in they want to close everything so I was president-elect I think right around that time and I went to Lima I went through the factory where they make these trucks to plant and they make the tanks and they make all of these armored vehicles and I said these people are amazing you could never close this you could never reopen it again they\\'ve been doing this for many many decades and this factory was incredible and I looked at the tanks they\\'re making they\\'re the best in the world right the Abrams they\\'re the best in the world I said wait a minute if you close this we\\'re not gonna be able where you gonna build tanks this is the primary factory in the whole country I think it might be the only factory of the whole country so they\\'re gonna close it what are we gonna do send over to China for thanks please let us please send us 200 tanks we don\\'t want to send you any tanks because we\\'re gonna kick your ass we got to make our own tanks right we got to make our own tanks so I did something based on my instinct because instinct sometimes works better than anything else based on my instinct I said you can\\'t close this plant I went through that plant I spent 2-3 hours talking to the people that worked there I looked at some of that hydraulic and I\\'m I loved the whole thing the world of tractors and all of that stuff I know a lot about it and I looked at the carvings I looked at the metal I looked at how perfect everything was the turrets the round how perfect it fit they put it on it would fit like within 1/100 of an inch and I said you\\'re not gonna be able to do this anyplace else I said and we\\'re gonna be expanding our military we\\'re gonna be rebuilding who the hell\\'s gonna make our tanks if you closed it I said keep it open I actually it was all closed does every anybody from Lima is that a true story right it was cloudless they announced it was close it was all set to close I said you can\\'t close this plan and now look the numbers I just gave you we\\'re making almost 500 tanks you could have never reopened a place like that it\\'s incredible and you could have never got those workers they are really skilled people and if you did it would have cost you billions and billions of dollars to do it it wouldn\\'t have been as good as what you have so that was something I did that I\\'m very proud of because I really overrode a lot of talented people that wanted to close it I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we further recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights 52 years four years you watch as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Ohio at stake in our present battle is the survival of the American nation if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for and fought so hard to secure that we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020 we have to win you

few years ago you remember that very big night they said Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin and since then we\\'ve produced everything we said and more and more before it was talked I said I\\'m going to do this we\\'re going to take care of your trade what we\\'ve done with China now and Wednesday we sign that\\'s tomorrow but we\\'ve done with the USMC a while we\\'ve done with Japan forty billion dollar trade deal that a lot of it has to do with the farmers South Korea you gotta love Trump you got a lift and your Great Green Bay Packers are playing San Francisco as we\\'ve been good luck so do we have any Green Bay Packer fans [Music] [Applause] and you have a great quarterback who\\'s a good guy good guy as we begin the year our economy is booming wages are rising poverty is plummeting crime is falling and America is the envy of the entire world and then our opponents say we\\'re not going to win let\\'s impeach President Trump not the greatest economy in our history our military has been totally rebuilt let\\'s impeach him but we\\'ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible and we will soon be replacing the NAFTA catastrophe one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world frankly with the incredible u.s. MCA Canada Mexico a giant victory for Wisconsin workers farmers and dairy producers a tremendous victory and we may get that all taken care of this week or next week just needs one more vote and we\\'ll get that out of the Republican Senate the Republican Senate will be great tomorrow we\\'ll also be signing our phase 1 trade deal with China massively boosting exports of products made and produce right here in the great state of Wisconsin so after years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the United States military to a point that it has never been before and in style more advanced more lethal and more powerful than ever and last year our great American warriors because that\\'s what they are and they love it I gotta tell you I know so they love it right they loved they loved doing that they wouldn\\'t trade places with me under any circumstances they wouldn\\'t trade places with all of our great Wisconsin politicians they want to be a military warrior and we don\\'t want them for that we want them doing what they\\'re doing but our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of Isis the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead and the wicked caliphate is 100% destroyed and I will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago Isis was all over the place now the caliphate is 100% destroyed do you remember what I wanted to leave when it was at 98% I said let some of the other countries finish it off we\\'re going home right they all said oh no sir please finish it off so we finished it off it\\'s a hundred percent a few days ago we took bold and decisive action to defend American lives and deliver American justice at my direction the United States military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world\\'s number one terrorist number one terms you know that is Qasim Solomon number one terrorist in the world Solomon he was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans it was actively planning new attacks but we stopped them cold and frankly they already started the attack as you saw in Baghdad on a very large embassy in Baghdad that was already started and I said to our generals get there now we don\\'t want to have another Benghazi on my watch on any watch they said sir we\\'ll be there tomorrow I said nope you got to be there right now get them over there now now and there thousands of soldiers there were soldiers you take a look at that ground that was not protesters they were soldiers and they were surrounding our embassy in Baghdad and all of a sudden they see these beautiful very expensive I will tell you brand-new Apache helicopters [Applause] [Music] and then they see our great military you saw them in the plane right some of them were getting out of their pajamas they were I said don\\'t worry about it I said we won\\'t put that on but they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane right and it was a beautiful sight and these guys were better than Tom Cruise [Applause] so tomorrow with the fake news here\\'s your headline he\\'s your head you know we have thousands of people outside wanting to get in they can\\'t because you people got here first but so here\\'s your headline tomorrow protesters disturb the rally one protester a very weak voice you know a few people wouldn\\'t go crazy every time you see something you\\'d go right through and nobody would even know she was there now she\\'s gone home to mom where she will be in big trouble because I guarantee you that mom voted for Trump [Applause] and in ten years from now when I run yet again she\\'ll be voting for Trump too I\\'m only kidding I\\'m only kidding we drive them crazy we drive them crazy they say you know he\\'s not leaving don\\'t you he\\'s never leaving they say he\\'s going to win he\\'s never going to leave you know these people it\\'s called trumped arrangements in JAMA drilling is there they are so fun you know what they don\\'t know is that if for any reason after five years we do leave which we will because I believe in that stuff right but you know what\\'s going to happen to their industry they\\'re all going to die and fold-up going to be very boring out there very boring that\\'s why I say at some point every single one of them will be endorsing Donald Trump [Applause] but crazy Bernie Sanders and the Washington Democrats by the way bernie is surging Bernie Bernie is surging but the Democrats are outraged that we kill this terrorist monster even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death [Applause] that\\'s too hey speaking of protesters have you seen what\\'s happened in Iran the protesters are on our side first time ever they\\'re on our side in fact they put this big American flag on the street and the Iranians thousands and thousands of Iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it every one of them went around that flag they like Trump they like you I\\'m just your representative but they like us they like us they haven\\'t seen anything like that in a long time they want to rent did you see it they went around the flag they didn\\'t want to touch it they love America they love our country that\\'s called progress that\\'s called progress but the Democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hint on this monster you know many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms and without legs and without we\\'re done by soleimani that\\'s what he loved he loved the roadside bomb that\\'s what he loved thousands and thousands and thousands in Iraq in Afghanistan roadside bombs he was the king of the roadside bombs great percentages of people don\\'t have legs right now in arms because of this son of a bitch [Applause] and the Democrats should be outraged by Solomon his evil crimes not the decision to end his wretched life to sing well he was a general he was this he was that you know what number one he wasn\\'t supposed to be there he was a designated terrorist by President Obama who didn\\'t do anything about it as usual as usual they don\\'t do anything they designate and they don\\'t do anything about he should have been killed 20 years ago now here\\'s the start with the Democrats if I didn\\'t kill him and let\\'s say we lost three four five embassies or bases or thousands of people are hundreds of people that do people were killed they would have said Trump should have taken him out anything we do they go the opposite so we kill him and that was precision some people thought it went much too fast went too fast so we kill him and they say what a horrible if we didn\\'t kill him that say what a horrible thing right you know with the wall we\\'re building the wall you know that right and by the way they think they caught me and they never catch us because you know Mexico\\'s paying for the wall you know that you\\'ll see they\\'re so worked out Mexico spent it\\'s driving them crazy now they say okay\\'s building the wall but in Mexico didn\\'t pay Mexico will pay and here\\'s the thing here\\'s the thing you\\'ll see that it\\'ll come out we\\'ll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before our debate the real debate that people are going to watch because nobody\\'s watching you know the other have they haven\\'t been doing great on the debates I have to tell you but we are building this wall we\\'re over a hundred miles right now we\\'re going to be expanding the length you have a lot of natural where you have 1978 miles you need 500 miles but 700 would be good 750 or so would be great we\\'re going to now get it up we have all the financing you think it\\'s easy getting financing when people could I can get anything from them I can get whatever I want in terms of money except for a wall and I made one big mistake I should have said to him we will not build the wall we don\\'t want the wall they would have insisted that we build it we would have had all the money we wanted I made this I made a big mistake now we\\'re building the wall it\\'s going up and it\\'s going up rapidly and very soon we\\'ll be building about a mile a day and we should be up to over 400 miles by next year the end of next year and shortly thereafter it\\'ll be finished and it\\'s already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country birdy and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country nor do they want to I think according to Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren who has somewhat less Indian blood in her than I do and I have done remember oh we hit her hard but I hit her too early but now it doesn\\'t matter she\\'s not going anywhere but Bernie said according to her Bernie said and I don\\'t believe that he said this cuz you know I don\\'t know him I don\\'t particularly like him too nasty guy but I don\\'t believe he said it\\'s not his deal you know you have to know what people say she said right that Bernie stated strongly that a woman can\\'t win for president a woman can\\'t win for president fortunately that could happen that could happen who knows but she said that Bernie said a woman can\\'t win I don\\'t believe that Bernie said that I really don\\'t so you know just know Burt it\\'s not the kind of a thing he\\'d say if you want to keep America safe just vote Republican we\\'re doing so well [Applause] now this was the I leave him live no longer soon let security just take care of her okay you all right get him out of here [Applause] good job security good job good job do we love law enforcement as is there ever ever a better place to be than a trump rally on some night during some week you know the truth is we have a great time but you know what more importantly we get things done we\\'re getting everything done but even President Obama\\'s own former national security adviser a highly respected general named Jim Jones praised our action to take out sulla money and said it was absolutely correct and it was the absolute right thing to do I\\'m sure I\\'m sure they liked him very much he sounds like our kind of a guy so Jim have they given you a hard time come on over to the Republican Party now he\\'s a respected guy said we did the right thing everyone knows to say was the attack eminent was it eminent does the fact that he\\'s killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of Americans and horribly killed and wounded thousands and thousands that doesn\\'t matter was the attack eminent I think they\\'re gonna start a new investigation was the attack on this whore and by the way he was in a country he wasn\\'t allowed to be in but you know we don\\'t mention that because he was designated and he wasn\\'t allowed to be there and he was there with a head of Hezbollah and they were talking about like Hillary Clinton they were talking about weddings and working out Salameh knee in the head of Hezbollah they were talking about weddings working out or Bill Clinton in the back of the airplane with the Attorney General where they may have made her an offer that you\\'re going to go to the Supreme Court or they may have said you\\'re gonna stay Attorney General but help help they may have said that do you think they would have said that no nothing like that but you remember they talked about golf and grandchildren right 45 minutes you know I like golf and I love my grandchildren I don\\'t think I can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that I don\\'t even know 45 I have a beautiful grandchild he\\'s really beautifully so great okay what else am I gonna say right then I took off let\\'s talk one or two how\\'s Tiger doing how\\'s this one I was that one that\\'s another five minutes right what am I gonna do with the other thirty five minutes maybe I got to talk about Supreme Court appointments etc well we\\'re doing very well but at this very moment the good people of Iran are taken to the streets in numbers like nobody\\'s seen before and they\\'re really protesting the repressive regime and demanding a better future you know they\\'re great people the great the great people of Iran they\\'re great people they get it [Applause] and they\\'re tired of watching their leaders plunder Iran to stoke violence and death and war and you know a ranch causes problems for 40 years just so you understand Reagan had it iran-contra God are at it fifty two hostages how about that destroyed his presidency was pretty well destroyed before that door friend why did it didn\\'t help actually probably got Reagan elected if you think about it right but no Carter had it fifty two hostages Reagan had a ran Contra Obama had just you know he was like begging them for everything but Obama gave him 150 billion 1.8 billion in cash Queen got zero he got zero out of him he got zero I\\'d love to have that money back it\\'s a lot of money but I\\'ve warned the Ayatollah and the government of Iran that they must not harm hurt or kill any protesters the whole world is watching its luck charm we\\'ve killed thousands of protesters we support the Iranian people and their courageous struggle for freedom it\\'s incredible what\\'s going on over there it really is but we\\'re watching and we\\'re watching very closely and we were ready you know that night when the attack was made on us Tech was made on us remember this they killed an American they killed other people just before that and so we did what we did right then they said it\\'s our turn now I said you better be careful when you say it\\'s our turn because we had designated targets that you wouldn\\'t it would have taken him 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible [Applause] and we saw those missiles launch and they were big and they were fast and they were accurate four of them went bad they fell way short but twelve of them had and I said man they are quick they knew immediately what they were and they saw those missiles hit I said how bad is it it hit a base and an hour later or so we get a call back I said how many killed nobody sir [Applause] I said how many hurt they said nobody sir [Applause] and I said they just saved themselves a trillion dollars at a lot of lives it\\'s true a trillion not have been in a trillion so they did a very smart figured we\\'re not looking for regime change they\\'ve tried that with Libya they go Hillary Clinton let\\'s get rid of let\\'s get rid of Libya let\\'s get rid of Gaddafi let\\'s get rid of Qaddafi how\\'s that working out right let\\'s get rid of Gaddafi that was a Hillary deal then you had Benghazi and see see Benghazi they didn\\'t respond they didn\\'t respond and then the genius to iraq iraq didn\\'t knock down the World Trade Center just in case anybody had any question and this guy did kill he was not a sweetheart he was a bad guy in every way but he did kill terrorists right and it became Harvard University for terrorists right but they did go after him but he didn\\'t knock down we\\'re getting the hell out we\\'re moving you know we did something in Syria we were guarding their border at one point we had thousands of people the Syrian border between Turkey and Syria it\\'s been there for a thousand years they\\'ve been fighting for me our soldiers out of there I did I\\'m out and you know what I did with the soldiers they don\\'t tell you the truth sir because they\\'re a bunch of corrupt people back there [Applause] I told Turkey you got to defend your own border we\\'re not gonna defend your border and we get along with Turkey we get a lot but they\\'ve been there for and by the way I call it a safe zone that is the most dangerous safe zone in the world okay I\\'m looking at the audience is about three of you that want to be in that zone okay and you\\'re very tough people but this is the most danger I call that I called the safe zone someday it may be a safe zone but I took our soldiers out because we had an army here and we had a vast number of people here and they were gonna fight I said if they\\'re gonna fight like they happen for hundreds and hundreds of years for centuries let them fight but we get the hell out of there okay but the fake news doesn\\'t tell you the right story but the fake news doesn\\'t tell you the right stone because what I did is I took our soldiers and you know what I did I moved him to the oil area and we now control the oil so they said Trump stayed in Syria Trump said so people said to me why are you staying in Syria okay a long time ago you have no idea the things and the decisions I\\'ve seen so they say Trump sincere I didn\\'t pull out I did pull out we have the oil really secure and we\\'ll see what happens with it but we can help our friends the Kurds because that\\'s where they got their wealth and then ultimately it was with Isis it was but right now it\\'s with the United States military and we also got rid of remnants of Isis while we\\'re creating jobs and killing terrorists Democrats in Congress are wasting America\\'s time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts that have been going on by the way from the day I came down the escalator with our future first lady somebody said to me recently President President was a friend of mine you so he\\'s call me Donald hey Donald how you doing let\\'s go have dinner okay good now he calls me president I told you this before across me Fred they always call me president president president tell me what\\'s happening what\\'s going on how\\'s it all going you\\'re doing such a great job I said do me a favor call me Donald I can\\'t now when they say you know what that means right that means respect for the office of president and you know what we\\'re gonna keep it that way we\\'re going to keep it we\\'re gonna keep it there but that\\'s why this stuff em we\\'re going back and we\\'re gonna win the house the Republicans are gonna win the house because I don\\'t know if you know it the impeachment hoax it\\'s a total hoax paper this is face just think of this this is based on a perfect phone call did anybody read the transcript it\\'s a perfect call fact if you go back and look at Lyndon Johnson all of them take a little you know Lyndon Johnson was sort of a tough guy can you imagine his phone calls he\\'s probably looking down or looking up and he\\'s probably and he\\'s probably saying these people have gone crazy that\\'s the nicest call I\\'ve ever liked somebody said I never knew you could be so nice on the telephone but this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate where the president of Ukraine said there was no pressure on us didn\\'t even know what they were talking about the Foreign Minister said they want to impeach impeach the President of the United States over a perfect phone call it\\'s the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country but we\\'re going to go back and because of it in Wisconsin I don\\'t have you seen independent voters and voters I think of all of all of the voters including Democrats moving over we just got 195 to nothing the Republicans in the house which was a fix we got a hundred you know Nancy Pelosi says it must be non partisan it must and she said it has to be clear-cut well number one never happened no problem number two look at the vote three Democrats voted with us so I guess you could say I guess you could say it was the non partisan vote because they voted with us okay but we\\'re going back and we\\'re going to hold the Senate and we\\'re going to keep the White House but we\\'re going to win back the house we\\'re gonna win back the house and I\\'m thrilled tonight a man has become a great friend of mine he\\'s a warrior Senator Ron Johnson is here come up with what a good guy [Applause] congressman Brian style jim sensenbrenner glam Grothman Glenn come up Mike Gallagher Wisconsin House Speaker Robin vos Wisconsin state Senate President Roger Roth state Senate President [Applause] Wisconsin State Senate Majority Leader scott Fitzgerald a friend of mine a world champion Creek he climbs for kid would you believe it is Shawn here get up here I love champion he would climb that sucker he was the best in the world right here from Wisconsin right congressman Sean Duffy we miss him but you know he signed with CNN they paid him a lot of money and they don\\'t put him on why because I\\'m Pro Trump you think that\\'s fair right he\\'s Pro Trump so what they\\'ve done is pay the money to silence him because he has a very important voice I like that kind of your time I think he\\'s okay with gets his check they refused to put him on he says good things about Trump we don\\'t want you on that see you then that\\'s how fake right there turn the camera [Applause] and a good friend of all of ours a Kenosha native writes Priebus writes come up thank you thank you this is a great group of Republican people but more importantly it\\'s a great group of winners they have been so great so they worked so hard and I just want to thank you all for being here [Applause] [Applause] well thank you for your strong show of support present trunk [Music] [Applause] we ran a pretty tough campaign together here to Wisconsin 2016 and when it was all said and done I was tired I did take some days off you know who didn\\'t take any days off president Trump I have never seen a man work harder being so dedicated so in love with America that is why we all need to make sure that he wins a second term [Applause] I have also I\\'m 64 years old I\\'ve never in my lifetime seen a man or get elected president states where there wasn\\'t some measure of well wishes some honeymoon period where America gathered around that individual and said mr. president we also it\\'s a big job we wish you will keep us safe make this country prosperous that hasn\\'t happened that\\'s because the Democrats simply won\\'t admit he beat them [Applause] he has been tormented since the day after the election but he has held strong it hasn\\'t bothered him he\\'s just pressed forward he\\'s made this country great our economy\\'s in great shape he deserves to get reelected [Applause] right like all of you like all of you he loves his country he will do everything to defend it we love president Trump god bless you president Trump thank you rung a great guy thanks to strong Republican leadership like Ron like all of them but you just saw America is winning again America is respected again and America is thriving again like never before we\\'re doing this with the envy of the world and under my administration we now have the lowest average unemployment rate of any Administration in the history of our country and in your great state Wisconsin never noticed with my DS always gone the wrong state and in your great state of Iowa Iowa yes Iowa right no it\\'s worse cards oh I meant Wisconsin oh I didn\\'t know I was in wizkid that\\'s fine how many times has he done that by the way lots of times he said it\\'s great to be in the state of Ohio no sir you\\'re in you\\'re in Florida many times the sad part about that sleepy Joe is right you know the sad part about that when you do that you can\\'t really recover you can be Winston Churchill make the finest remainder of remarks but you get killed and he does it every time and the fake news they give him a total pass and that\\'s okay it\\'s gonna happen to all of us someday does anybody get that yet in Wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history how\\'s that for a sound bite how do you beat that sound buddy right so now the people of Wisconsin they can say well let\\'s see the state set a record most successful that\\'s ever been and by the way that\\'s because we got a lot of help from a guy named Scott Ron Johnson all those guys cuz this didn\\'t happen so quickly but think so how do you how do you beat that you have the most successful lowest unemployment rate you\\'ve ever had and then they say somebody\\'s going to come and say oh we\\'ll do a better job really gonna do a better job the lowest in history by far your number one economic numbers by far oh let\\'s put somebody else in as president I don\\'t think so right but here\\'s one that I love the most african-american Hispanic American Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our time and here\\'s another one african-american youth you know the way it was so high was so terrible youth unemployment has reached an all-time low in recorded history african-american poverty has reached the lowest rate ever recorded also and by the way just out of curiosity how are you 401ks the only question are you at 70 80 90 97 pratik Oh sire what are you at what\\'s yours 100% not bad I know who he\\'s voting for but think of this because this is what it\\'s about is that you know that these companies these big public companies they\\'re owned by the people they\\'re owned by everybody rich people and they\\'re owned by everybody we have said 141 records on the stock market highest levels ever in recorded history 141 records that means in less than three years for a hundred and forty-one days we set a record think of it we\\'ve said 141 records who the hell can do that [Applause] and if our opponents had won the election instead of going up you know we\\'re very close to 30,000 on the down nobody thought that was possible including the fakers back there nobody thought that was possible instead of being up you would have died I believe I really believe because regulations so important tax cuts so important to get it all going I believe instead of being up massively whatever the number is but depending on who you are changes but it\\'s all way of err 60 70 80 you guys know you would have been down 50 60 70 you would have been down at a level you would probably be extremely depressed right then you wouldn\\'t have bought all those brand new Keep America great hats don\\'t worry we\\'re never getting rid of market don\\'t worry we don\\'t have the courage to get rid of Magha the greatest campaign in history we\\'re never leaving but you wouldn\\'t have bought those hats you know why you wouldn\\'t had the money to buy him okay now you can buy him it doesn\\'t be the damn thing so let\\'s do it real fast the poll right make America great again or keep America great right you know I don\\'t have to go through the whole deal we\\'re gonna do it quick we\\'re gonna do it quickly ready who likes make America great again you\\'re very loyal people in Wisconsin who likes Keep America great so it surprises me every single time but make America great again Mecca has never won one of these polls you know why we\\'ve rebuilt our military we\\'ve cut taxes we\\'ve cut regulation our stock market hit records it\\'s called keep America great I mean we\\'ve done so much and I just got a free C these Democrats they go out spend a million dollars in a poll what I do is I take my own poll and they\\'ll interview 203 people 203 people say they\\'ll get it wrong because I\\'m always surprised make America great again I think is the greatest phrase ever used in politics right so to switch it may be crazy so we\\'re gonna use them both okay we\\'ll use but under the Trump economy the lowest-paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains you know that right this is a blue-collar boom they don\\'t like telling you that under my administration the growth in net worth for the bottom half of wage earners has increased fifteen times more than under the three previous administrations that\\'s pretty amazing because they keep saying oh the rich getting richer well the poor are doing the best they\\'ve ever done earnings for the bottom ten percent are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% proportionately under eight years of the Barack Hussein Obama administration which administration loves spying on people\\'s campaigns by the way by the way could you imagine if it were the other way around and I spied on his campaign what would these fake News people be doing more than 300,000 people under Obama 300,000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3.5 million people have joined the workforce and nobody believed that was possible 370 companies have signed our pledge to America\\'s workers providing more than 14 million Americans with new training and job opportunities we\\'re training them we\\'re getting them Walmart so many great companies they\\'re training people because they can train a much better than government 14 million you knows worked so hard on that everybody you\\'ve heard of Ivanka right she had such a passion for it she\\'s very smart I said would you like this job no dad I want to get people working I want to get them and help families so I said all right good look she\\'s smart go do whatever the hell you want to do is okay darling so she had a goal of a half a million people she was going to get trained get into companies so she\\'d call Walmart\\'s and call Exxon should call all these great companies and all of a sudden she hit 8 million then she hit 9 million don\\'t forget she wanted to do 500,000 but this is her since she had 10 million she just said 14 million people are being trained by these factories 14 million Ivanka 14 million would you believe that\\'s possible but that\\'s why we have the best unemployment rates we have the best employment rates by the way 160 very close to 160 million people are now working in the United States nobody\\'s ever even come close to that number we\\'ve lifted 10 million people off federal welfare programs real median income is now at the highest level ever recorded in the history of our country think of that real real median income under 8 years so we\\'re three years right but really less because when it was done the stats it was two and a half but we have less than three under eight years of the Bush administration household incomes grew four hundred dollars eight years four hundred dollars under eight years of President Obama household incomes grew nine hundred and seventy-five tells that\\'s okay nine seventy five eight years right under three years of the Trump administration household incomes have risen ten thousand dollars 10,000 that\\'s why we\\'re doing with the consumer $3,100 of which for regulatory cuts $2,000 for the tax cut so it\\'s actually higher than that $2,500 for energy savings and $5,000 in real wage gains $10,000 the child tax credit alone which every Democrat in Congress opposed is delivering $2,200 a year to the average American family who\\'s who\\'s in favor of that cut who\\'s in favor of having that people don\\'t know they think the Democrats gave it the Democrats give nothing there - am busy and they\\'re too busy doing other things they don\\'t - what if they\\'re too busy doing other things we ended the war on American energy the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth number one in the world by far Saudi Arabia Russia but we\\'re number one by far and if I get a couple of additional pipelines approved which I will very quickly instead of waiting 20 years to get them approved it\\'ll increase this by another twenty two percent that will get them done quickly [Applause] and they\\'ll be environmentally friendly in all of them I believe in that we have eliminated a record number of job-destroying regulations I brought back the old lightbulb better light for much less money if you want somebody said oh sure don\\'t mention the light bulb you know it\\'s hard to make an elegant speech up so I brought back the leap up so the new light bulb cost you five times as much and it makes you look orange and I was more interested in the orange than I was in the cost but you know what if you want you have it and you know the new bow I don\\'t know if you see it it\\'s on there it\\'s a hazardous waste that when that ball ends you\\'re supposed to take it to a certain dump and gingerly put it in because it\\'s loaded up with gasses that\\'s enough I said to somebody today an environmental protection how many people do that in the country sir maybe none they throw it into the garbage can but I\\'m also approving new dishwashers that give you more water so you can actually wash and rinse your dishes without having to do it ten times four five six seven eight nine ten anybody have a new dishwasher I\\'m sorry for that I\\'m sorry for that it\\'s worthless they give you so little water you ever see it air comes out they so little water so what happens you end up usually at ten times and the plates then you take them out and do them the old-fashioned way right but what do you do you spending ten times for the electricity right so I\\'m putting the water back most places have so much water they don\\'t know what the hell to do with it you know a lot of people don\\'t realize it so dishwashers now you\\'re going to have it just as much as you\\'ve ever had and you\\'re gonna use now one shot your dishes are gonna be beautiful I\\'m sorry that you just bought one of those brand-new pieces of garbage but darling you control [Applause] and it\\'s sent away and it was just announced from South Korea makes a lot of our products unfortunately I put a tariff on washing machines and refrigerators right they just announced that they\\'re building major refrigerator and washing machine plants in the United States you know why you know why because they don\\'t want to pay the 25 percent tariff so they\\'re building them here that way they don\\'t have to pay [Applause] and just one final thing I know this doesn\\'t matter but I say to leave it it\\'s so uh nelligan to talk about it right right isn\\'t it an elegant I\\'m talking about dishwashers when you hear the next one I\\'m talking about refrigerators probably won\\'t in the State of the Union I\\'ll leave it out because I want to get praised for making it you cannot make a brilliant speech where they say that was such an incredible elegant speech if I\\'m talking about dishwashers sinks toilets lightbulbs but sinks toilets and showers you don\\'t get any water they put restrictors on and now they made impermanent people used to take them out they put restrictors on try going and buying the new faucet you turn it on no water comes out right we won\\'t talk about toilets but you know that\\'s good 10:53 but we don\\'t talk about that because I\\'ve said this three or four times the only subject they ever talk about is toilet so I don\\'t mention it but how about the shower you go into a shower and I have this beautiful head of hair I need a lot of water [Music] and you go into the shower right you turn on the water drip drip drip I call the guy something wrong with this no sir it\\'s just a restrictor so you\\'re in there five times longer than you\\'re supposed to be you use probably more water and it\\'s a very unpleasant experience right so we\\'re getting rid of the restrictors you\\'re gonna have full shower flow bullshit did you ever go to the faucet you turn on the faucet to wash your hands and it turns on so easy it\\'s like it\\'s you know cuz it\\'s zero pressure behind it no water you go like that the thing flips on whoa and then Doong Doong these people are crazy and then in california this governor who has no clue by the way he has no clue governor Gavin Newsom he sends all the water out to the Pacific and then he just comes up I don\\'t know if you saw this they come up with rules and regulations that\\'s starting soon if you\\'re a person lives in California you only get 50 gallons of water now it sounds like a lot of water but it\\'s not if you take a shower wash your hands a couple of times a day it\\'s not then it goes down to 47 46 45 can you imagine you pay the highest taxes outside of New York where they\\'re not doing a good job in New York they\\'re not doing good everyone\\'s leaving New York for other environs like Florida it\\'s not good because the taxes are too high Governor Cuomo\\'s got to get those taxes down got to get them down and other things have to happen but his governess so gavin newsom you have the water pouring down from up north millions and millions of gallons you know what they do with it they diverted it to the Pacific Ocean because they have eaten we must be in Wisconsin No millions of gallons coming down from the north it goes Eva\\'s massive vowel if you talk about a valve this is a serious valve and they turn it and a chip because they have a tiny tiny little fish that\\'s doing very poorly with or without the water so in the meantime if you own a home on Beverly Hills they scream at you if you want to want you know what are you grass a little bit right but you have no water coming in they divert millions and millions of gallons and what we\\'ve just done for the people of California is we\\'ve made it possible on a federal basis that they don\\'t have to divert all that water anymore now that\\'s only good for California but these are the things we do and now the last one is we\\'re working on cars we\\'re making them less expensive and safer we\\'re giving them a tiny little bit more fuel and you\\'re going to save on average $3,500 you\\'re gonna have a heavier car a little bit meaning you\\'ll have steel instead of paper mache walls and we\\'re getting a lot of good displays and environmentally it\\'s better because now people the number is 12 from 12 years ago with the old gas guzzlers they\\'ll all be trading in their cars to get the new cars which they don\\'t do right now so it\\'s really gonna be something and we\\'re in a little fight with California over that but I think ultimately we win that one you\\'ll buy a better car a safer car for less money not a bad combination not a bad to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we\\'ve created opportunities owns jobs and investment are now pouring into one hundred and twenty newly designated opportunity zones right here in Wisconsin and Ron Johnson helped and Tim Scott of South Carolina helped they\\'re doing great they are doing good and for decades politicians ran for office promising to defend Wisconsin workers but then they went to Washington and line their pockets with special interest cash as they shipped your jobs and your dreams to countries thousands of miles away countries that you\\'ve never even heard of globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob your factories steal your farms by the way no estate tax on those beautiful farms we got rid of [Applause] so now if you love your children and you have a farm or a small business or a small ranch or even a large ranch you have no estate tax you can give it to the kids if you don\\'t love your children anybody in here does not love their children there is some don\\'t come on raise your head there is like you know they\\'re brats they\\'re little brats and horrible human beings so if you\\'re one of them this doesn\\'t help you because you\\'ll save subject that factors no estate tax on these small businesses and farms it\\'s a tremendous thing because you were dying you were leaving the business to your kids they all said thank you very much daddy and mommy and then they went out and mortgaged the hell out of the place and they ended up losing it to the banks but we got rid of the estate tax on small farms and businesses and really great things little stuff like that we\\'ve done that we never said we were going to do but these people were ransacking your communities but we are defenseless no more because at long last you have a president who puts America first [Applause] it\\'s been a long time we\\'re putting America first or no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people then that of immigration because traitor you have it a good time sir I think you are goes traitor they are I guess it a certain way there are traitors when you think about it left-wing politicians I call them the do-nothing Democrats support deadly sanctuary cities demonstrating their contempt scorn and disdain for everyday Americans these jurisdictions release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob attack and murder American citizens you have it right here yeah the right last year ice I love ice I think they\\'re so good you know they move thousands of ms-13 out of our country thousands and others too but ice officers in this region of our country arrested nearly 7000 illegal aliens with criminal records so you have 7,000 illegal aliens having criminal records including those charged or convicted of murder burglary robbery drug crimes killings in the most violent way right here in Wisconsin cities run by far-left politicians are releasing dangerous criminal aliens who abuse assault and threaten innocent children your children last year a place I like the sanctuary county of Milwaukee released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of child think of that of children he\\'s now at large they\\'re searching all over and he\\'s looking for yet another victim they\\'re searching all over allowed to go from your sanctuary City in the city of Madison police arrested an illegal alien for sexual assault after authorities released him he committed violent battery only to be released one more time they\\'re looking for him again isn\\'t that nice so the same illegal alien was then arrested for a third time in September and charged with multiple sexual assaults including sexual assault of a child now that criminal is once again in Wisconsin jail and I call on your left wing officials to stop the madness and to work with ice to ensure he is deported to hell back home get him out of our country [Applause] Democrat stand for crime corruption and chaos Republicans stand for law order and justice it\\'s true it\\'s true we believe Wisconsin should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not for criminal aliens we are removing these illegal criminals and gang members by the tens of thousands and we will not let them back and we made a deal with Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Mexico where they accept them back under the Obama administration they get him they\\'d bring them back and Honduras and Guatemala would say get down we\\'re not taking them back but with us they take them back [Applause] it helped a lot when we were paying them hundreds of millions of dollars a year think of it and I just said we\\'re not paying them anymore all of a sudden they said we would love to have our wonderful gang members back we would love to have our gang members back sir thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row and we\\'re being helped by our new hundred miles plus of war illegal crossings are down 78% since May and we have ended catch and release that was a tough hour very big and very powerful border wall is going up at a record speed and we are ready and with fully financed now isn\\'t that nice that was it easy that was not easy and we\\'re adding new miles every week and we were in track to soon build that wall you\\'re gonna have a wall like no other it\\'s going to be a powerful terrific wall and walls to work I hate to say remember the Democrats you don\\'t need walls oh really we we\\'d need drones they wanted us to put drones flying around taking pictures of everybody now did you see our part of the new wall two days ago illegal aliens with drugs on their back we\\'re climbing the wall they got to the top you know that panel on top is called a climb resistor it\\'s very slippery and very hot very hot and they got stuck in the wall they couldn\\'t get off the wall did you see that I was watching the news I was surprised at the fake news showed it and I said isn\\'t that a beautiful sight they couldn\\'t get over the wall [Applause] they had to get the fire department to get him down do you believe that 30 feet up that\\'s like a almost a four-story building Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now they going crazy they\\'re going totally loony nervous Nancy how about nervous how about her district her district is so filthy dirty its filthy dirty with all of the things I won\\'t say it but the needles and everything else these are areas that were 10 years ago the best in the country and now they\\'re disgusting she ought to spend more time back in San Francisco taking care of her community instead of wasting everybody\\'s time [Applause] but taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders AOC all these people liberal lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health insurance many of you have great insurance Republicans will never let that happen they\\'ll probably change their mind before they see this is why I don\\'t like talking about it now I\\'d rather wait six seven eight months let them say it five thousand times when they have to do it and then talk [Applause] now they want to take away your private helpful we will protect patients with pre-existing conditions like nobody else and we will protect your pre-existing physicians which you\\'ve had to get rid of which you will have to get rid of when this new plan never happens it don\\'t work but it\\'s not gonna happen it\\'s not gonna happen I wouldn\\'t worry about it sounds nice it doesn\\'t even sound good frankly there\\'s one that costs a fortune doesn\\'t even sound good at least let it sound good virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb of all mother and that is why I\\'ve asked Congress if it extremely term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God [Applause] Democrats are now the party of high taxes think of it they want to raise your taxes how does that work I guess I\\'m old-fashioned I\\'ve only been doing this for three I\\'m not experienced like other a senator came up - sir I\\'ve run seven different great one five times I said I\\'ve done one but I\\'ve won but it\\'s the people but now seriously we\\'re all smart people how is it good when they say we\\'re gonna raise your taxes the world is the world going crazy they say we\\'re going to raise your taxes we\\'re gonna open borders everybody can come in for everybody\\'s health insurance schooling you know I one time we\\'re gonna get everybody a Rolls Royce and CNN on one of them said they never said and they never promise no rolls-royce Donald Trump lied tonight I said every illegal alien will have a rolls-royce they said he lied tonight these people are sick [Applause] but they\\'re the party of late-term abortion socialism and corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American Dream and of course Honest Abe Lincoln right Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race religion color and Creed we are a movement there\\'s a movement like nobody has ever seen before you know when I mentioned this anything I say that\\'s even slightly false its headlines Trump said this these people he said this this is one of the greatest I would say this this is the greatest movement in the history of our country I mean there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of nowhere won the state of New Hampshire won Iowa won South Carolina down the way won they stayed someplace but we won 32 states [Applause] there\\'s never been a moment like this never happened before but we\\'re a movement for all Americans who believe in fairness and justice equality and dignity opportunity and safety we are a big tent and we are a big party of big ideas for the future and that\\'s why African Americans are joining the Republican Party like nobody ever thought even possible they love us and we love them and to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed was us not the Democrats they came to me they wanted to help I gave him help I got it done I called Republicans that maybe wouldn\\'t have been so inclined some of them some of them very much in blood some of them very conservative were very much inclined but I got the people that we needed Obama couldn\\'t do it Bush couldn\\'t do it nobody could do it I got it approved and from the day it was approved I got no thanks I got no credit and that\\'s okay because you know but we passed bipartisan criminal justice reform and that\\'s helped so many people I mean you know the story of Alice Johnson you know so many different stories it\\'s helped so many people especially in the african-american community the Hispanic community it\\'s helped a lot of people it\\'s a different world to appall the rule of law we have confirmed 187 federal judges of record who will interpret the Constitution as written 187 and last spring Wisconsin voters as you know elected a great judge to your state Supreme Court and this spring you have a chance to real echt another terrific judge Justice Daniel Kelly go vote for justice daniel kelly to defend the rule of law in Wisconsin daniel kelly we are aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and we\\'ve done great look until you get rid of it you never did great but we have done numbers that nobody thought possible in 2018 drug overdose deaths the overdose deaths fell for the first time in decades including by 10% in the state of Wisconsin 17 18 19 and even 21 percent in a couple of states [Applause] and China is now putting a big stop a big lid on fentanyl which is a disaster coming out of China said the president\\'s you got to do it people are dying got to do it they\\'re doing it and we are fighting very hard for school choice and it\\'s moving along well in Misco Milwaukee created the first school choice program 30 years ago to free children from failing government schools and now my administration is working to give school choice to every child in America who needs it as we continue rebuilding our military workers are building brand-new Humvee replacements you know about that in Oshkosh and magnificent new littoral combat ships in marionet lot of ships a lot of Humvees I recognize Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights something they\\'ve been trying to get for 52 years for years you watched as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for you the people of Wisconsin at stake in our present battle is the survival of the nation what these people are doing they will destroy our nation they will destroy our nation and our last election was so important I don\\'t know maybe the most important ever but it was so important I really believe that this election may be in its own way will be just as important I can\\'t say more but just as important because we need time for that tree to grow you know you plant a tree and it takes time we need time for that tree to grow and we have other things that we want to do if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020 have to do it only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all and I have found out what a swamp is bad people [Applause] I have become the expert on water swamp and you know what I used to say drained the swamp I had no idea it would be that bad but we\\'re winning we\\'re here and they\\'re not we\\'re winning bad people dishonest bad food with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare-to-work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration which now we\\'re already doing we\\'re already doing a lot of it you got to get loopholes you know you need their votes we have loopholes like Visa Lottery we put things in a lottery and they come in they become American citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest so let\\'s give them our best citizens but I meant these people are crazy to allow this to happen so we\\'re stopping at all but ending catch-and-release was a very big thing and we did that with no Democrat help they wouldn\\'t do it called loopholes who wouldn\\'t want to end loop we will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years who would have thought that we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms [Applause] and above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true American Way we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag and we live by the words of our national motto In God We Trust they\\'ll always be there we\\'ll never let up remove it those words will always be [Applause] from Milwaukee to Monroe from Bayfield to Green

warriors the greatest warriors in the world the Isis Caliphate has been totally destroyed and it\\'s savage founder and leader al Baghdadi is dead weeks ago at my direction the US military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world\\'s number one terrorist Kasim salamati and Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans and actively planning new attacks but we stopped him cold yet Washington Democrats like crazy Bernie Sanders and nervous dancing they opposed our action to save American lives they opposed it they opposed it you know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and the lots of other people so badly the legs the arms wiped out no legs no arms Salameh knee loved that that was his weapon of choice we didn\\'t like them he\\'s not around anymore while we are creating jobs and killing turns the congressional Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes crazy witch hunts and deranged partisan to say it\\'s all they know how to do that do-nothing Democrats they\\'ve spent the last three years and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady trying to overthrow the last election and we will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election we are going to have the victory that\\'s even greater than 2016 this November we are going to win back the house we are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House the American people are disgusted by the Washington Democrat wish well and you say it you say which is worse the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from Russia but we\\'re going to be signing up millions and millions of registered independents Democrat voters and today I had the best polls that I\\'ve ever had since the the best we\\'ve ever had remember I used to go over pulse but I only used to talk about him when I was doing well otherwise we had our best balls Americans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage-filled left socialists I never saw anything what\\'s going on in this country what\\'s going on in this country the Democrat really the Democrat Party is the Socialist Party it may be worse voters are making a mess exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the republican party with wide open arms and the republican party is doing great we are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the democrat party because he has had enough of their extremism enough of their socialism and enough of their vile hoaxes and scams he\\'s had enough I\\'ll tell you he really is he\\'s a brave guy he just said I\\'m not doing it I\\'m not doing it it\\'s a hoax it\\'s a scam I\\'m not doing it and we called them you know you\\'re a rock kind of guy let\\'s go and it didn\\'t take much because he believes like we do we are truly honored to be here with the newest Republican member of the House of Representatives your great congressman Jeff van drew and I have to tell you a few weeks ago Jeff was one of the few brave and principled Democrat lawmakers in all fairness we\\'ve been after him for a long time who stood up to the House Democrats and the outrageous abuse of power that you see going on right now they can\\'t win an election so they\\'re trying to steal that election it\\'s not happening folks it\\'s not happening and Jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party and to stand tall in defense of our Constitution our freedom and democracy itself and I just want to I have to tell you I\\'ve gotten to know him really well over the last couple of weeks he\\'s a great guy he\\'s a brave guy he shares our values he supports lower taxes not bad they want to raise your taxes how did that work Jeff how did you get elected with that one less regulation a strong national defense he loves our military loves our vets and police and he is a tireless champion for the state of New Jersey he loves your Second Amendment which is under seized by the Democrats Jeff it\\'s an honor to be with you please now how about having the president right here in South Jersey what a great day now I heard that the folks in this room can make more noise and more applause than anywhere in the world so we\\'re going to do one more time now when I was in the White House with the president he asked how he could help me I asked if he could come down to South Jersey and have a rally without even hesitating our president said yes and he is here a man who kept his word to ensure to ensure that the eyes of the world are on South Jersey and all of us the USA is a great nation the greatest nation that civilization has ever known do we want to keep it that way it\\'s a nation a nation and a people of great exceptionalism do we want to keep it that way our president has made it clear by restoring our military protecting our economy and by not allowing any other nations that ever take advantage of us again do we want to keep it that way this year this year this very year is a flashpoint election are we going to allow ourselves just to be like any other nation in the world or are we going to keep America gray I say to all of you may God bless South Jersey may God bless our president and may God bless the United States of America [Applause] so we have tens of thousands of people outside if anybody would like to give them your place please let us know but we have thousands and thousands tens of thousands and Jeff gave me a number he said 175,000 people signed up is that a fact [Applause] I think he\\'s on his way thank you Jeff thank you Jeff good job so it\\'s been a little bit of a story you see the fakers back there fake news you know you know of another candidate if another candidate has a thousand people they say he spoke to a massive crowd if they have 10,000 like Pocahontas went into Central Park in New York and this young man in the front row could have 10,000 feet people you know that in Central Park so she had 10,000 people like in Central Park and I said what\\'s the big deal they made a daughter crowds are so large so Jeff just told you had 175,000 people sign and seriously you have to see outside they know because they have to follow their trailers I call them trailers but they\\'re fake they\\'re fake then not honest let me just tell you so here\\'s the story so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time we have tens of thousands of people outside they never mention it they never match them so maybe they will tonight but that\\'s an all-time record and this is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holes probably 10,000 people or less and we set the old-time record you know why because for games see the floor with packed with people for games you playing ice hockey or basketball so we broke the all-time record in this house and it\\'s a wonderful house at a wonderful Canal also in wildwood like we\\'re in the middle of winter there is nobody in the middle of winter and it\\'s a great place of the summer and those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically so but on June 2nd everybody

my home Donald Trump\\'s my President Melania Trump\\'s my first lady life is great everyone god bless you Thank You Kellyanne so I just want to thank Republicans because what they\\'ve been doing is incredible Republican leadership in this country we\\'re winning winning winning like never before we\\'re winning again and we\\'ve got a party that\\'s a very different party a much stronger party a much more inclusive party we have a party that we love we have a party that has the votes we have a party like they\\'ve never had before the Republican Party respected again and I have to say this America is winning again and America is thriving again like never before so since the election we have created 7 million new jobs the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administrations listen to this one in United States history that\\'s a good fact the lowest in history Thank You Man we have a great veteran apparently said we love you we love you the veterans are we doing good for the veterans thank you african-american Hispanic American Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country ever recorded women\\'s unemployment is at a 65 year low sorry about that soon it\\'s going to be historic another couple of good months it\\'ll be historic 65 years for women in the eight years before I took office over 300,000 working age people left the workforce they had no choice in just three years of my administration 3.5 million people have joined the workforce nobody believes it including the fake news if I would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this the fakeness would have been hitting me he\\'s exaggerating he\\'s lying Pinocchio Pinocchio the press is very dishonest more than 2 million Millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly five percent every year which is a record a record number of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working another record under the Trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest games of anybody you don\\'t hear that because this is a blue-collar boom it\\'s about time it\\'s about times been many many decades earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% first time ever since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased listen to this by 47 percent three times faster than the increase for the top one percent median household income is at an all-time high for President Bush in eight years it was four hundred and fifty dollars over eight years they think of this for a second under President Barack Hussein Obama for for eight years it was 975 dollars so eight years eight years four hundred and fifty nine hundred and seventy-five right under your favorite president and when you include the tax cuts the regulation cuts that nobody\\'s ever cut taxes like this nobody\\'s ever cut regulations that\\'s why all these jobs a big bill under President Trump for three years the number is almost ten thousand dollars and that\\'s three and it\\'s going up going up very substance that\\'s a big difference new business applications in New Jersey have just soared to a record high and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare they\\'re off they are off federal welfare nobody would have believed these numbers someday they\\'re gonna write the true story our child tax credit alone is delivering $2,200 a year to 40 million American families and we have ended so importantly for you the war on American energy the United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world we don\\'t need anybody else\\'s energy anymore so no what happened in the last three years with energy is incredible but extreme liberals in Washington want to shut down US energy including through the so-called green New Deal close your factories get rid of your cows you don\\'t have too many cows and well do it but if you do their God we will never sacrifice America\\'s energy independence took us a long time to get there and we really picked it up over the last three years what we\\'ve done is incredible pipelines all over pipelines are good they\\'re underground they\\'re good environmentally sound to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most these are the communities that really have suffered we created with the help of a great gentleman from the state of South Carolina you know who I\\'m talking about Tim Scott right senator Tim Scott he\\'s an incredible guy he really is he came to my office and he had this idea that he\\'s wanted to do for a long time senator Tim Scott Opportunity Zones and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in New Jersey all over the United States billions and billions and billions of dollars and not government dollars they\\'re flowing into the opportunity zones into areas where investment was dead and for decades politicians ran for office promising to protect American workers but then they went to Washington and they line their pockets with special interests cash and they shipped American jobs and dreams to other countries they closed up your factories they got rid of jobs they didn\\'t have to pay taxes globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories steal our farms and ransack our communities not anymore not anymore because we are defenseless no more because at long last you have a president who puts America first is that okay the united states lost listen to this number and you know if it was wrong to fake this would be you know all over me and i\\'ve been saying it for three years the united states was sixty thousand factories and plants think events sixty you wouldn\\'t think that\\'s possible because the stupid trade deals because of bad leadership during the sixteen years of the two prior administrations under just three years my administration has now added twelve thousand new factories and many more are being built and they\\'re pouring back into the united states because that\\'s where the action is that\\'s where they want to be they are pouring back into our country new plants and factories you see them all over i passed two of them coming in brand-new beautiful plants and factories they\\'re pouring back in this is where the action is this is where they want to be i see the leaders they say it\\'s incredible what happened to your country i said don\\'t tell me that we want you to have your companies build plants in new jersey and other places and that\\'s what\\'s happened but our know is you have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of immigration left-wing radical politicians support deadly sanctuary cities and remember a sanctuary City is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody instead they order them to be released into your community what the hell is going on what is going and what set loose these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes free against innocent Americans right here in New Jersey your state\\'s Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community for example Cumberland County we all know Cumberland County very well right good luck with this one they released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child he is now at large free to search for another innocent victim they didn\\'t want to give them to ice and I want to thank ice because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do right here another criminal Alan was arrested for a violent assault in New Jersey the sanctuary jurisdiction of Middlesex County defied the ice request to detain him local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder happens I could read these cases honestly I could read and state these cases to you all night I could state these cases you all know no American should ever be hurt harmed or killed because left-wing politicians Democrats decided to shield and shelter criminal look look wait you have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail you have criminals that on this street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from and by the way ice ice has removed thousands upon thousands of ms-13 gang members the most brutal people and you don\\'t want to do that job maybe you do a couple of tough people up there a couple anybody want to be with ice yet a lot of tough people in New Jersey New Jersey\\'s different I think New Jersey now but these ice people they love our country they\\'re proud and they\\'re tough people and they\\'ll go right into a pack if they caught a pack and they start swinging and everyone\\'s swinging and they end up standing up that\\'s the end of that and you know what they do they bring the ms-13 and many other gang members and other members back to El Salvador back to Honduras back to Guatemala back to Mexico and I want to thank Mexico because the Mex in you know what\\'s happening right thousands and thousands at this moment 27,000 soldiers from Mexico protecting our southern border I want to thank the president Democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos Republicans said for law order and justice and say what you want but those are the facts and we are removing these illegal criminals and gang members we are literally taking him by so many thousands and thousands and we\\'re bringing them back and thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row we have the numbers down by seventy five percent since spring seventy five percent [Applause] and we have ended catch-and-release and really luck I had another party I could get anything if I wanted to spend money on anything look with the military we got two trillion dollars right more two trillion all made in America right everything best planes best missiles best everything made in America if I wanted to build anything the only thing they put the whole weight of their party they didn\\'t want us to have the wall they knew it worked many of them voted five years ago for a wall they just did not to get it built I do but what happened is through a series of court cases and other things we\\'ve won the money is won and we are now building that beautiful wall and this powerful voter wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall and by next year we\\'ll be over 400 miles and shortly thereafter it will be complete a lot of people were saying a year ago I didn\\'t build the wall yet he didn\\'t build a wolf let me tell you when you have the strength of a party that has the house okay hopefully they\\'re not gonna have the house for long we\\'ll have a wonderful new speaker we\\'ll get rid of Nancy Pelosi nervousness nervous dancing we\\'ll have Kevin McCarthy who\\'s been fantastic we have to win back the house but think of this the wall so many people were saying building well not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the house not easy and we did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military the Army Corps of Engineers anyway but you know what now we actually have the money and it\\'s going up very rapidly and in all due respect to Mexico we like Mexico very much as we\\'ve gotten along great with Mexico and the president\\'s a friend of mine and I think he\\'s doing a fantastic job it\\'s a tough situation but Mexico is in fact you will soon find out paying for the wall ok they\\'d hit you with that now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico and it\\'s an advantage for Mexico too when you think about it the wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities what we\\'re doing is stopping drugs at a record number it\\'s still anything that comes over is too much but we\\'re blocking it at a record number and I\\'m also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration we will now be finally able to enforce federal law and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs we were killing our country killing our country Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now frankly they\\'re crazy these people are crazy they\\'re taking their cues from socialists like Bernie left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health care plans which many people like the plans of every Democrat running for president would demolish the economy of New Jersey where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies we have them working at the companies and we have people getting great health care it\\'s been so long it\\'s finally working and they want to destroy it the Republican Party will never let it happen we are saving your health care well the Democrats are trying to take away your health care take away your doctors take away all of the good care that we fight and we fought hard and we\\'re doing well and now we\\'re doing better and by the way some time prior to the end of the year were putting in for a new middle income tax cut a very big boy but we\\'re making health care better and much much cheaper we\\'ve done a great job in running it and we\\'ve given you a lot of alternatives we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will the Republican Party pre-existing conditions we saved it we are stopping surprised medical billing and making everything transparent that\\'s a big deal and that will take effect starting at about two months from now everything\\'s transparent you\\'ll be able to see pricing you\\'ll be able to go and price other hospitals other doctors it\\'s going to be an incredible thing nobody believes I was able to do it but we did it we are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice we are lowering drug prices the Democrats are increasing drug prices we are fighting the lobbyists and special interests we are serving you and how we doing we\\'re doing but because of price transparency we are getting it done we\\'re approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country that means they come in frankly they\\'re just as good as the big names but they sell for eighty percent less in some cases we are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds we are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers these are all things that we had a fight like hell to get we\\'re making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records which is a big deal for a lot of people we are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs you go home you say oh I\\'m feeling better the doctor was fantastic and then they send you bill for twenty five thousand that\\'s the end of that all of a sudden the doctor wasn\\'t so good right we are making companies compete for your business we are repealing burdensome taxes we have accomplished more than any president in the first three years of their term by far not even close we have provided health insurance options 60% cheaper than Obamacare and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease HIV pediatric cancer and Alzheimer\\'s disease were making so much progress and we have just passed a thing that I think is great I never understood for 45 years they\\'ve been trying to get it passed we\\'ve just passed a thing called right to try you know what that is so we have the greatest doctors the greatest technicians the greatest labs in the world and we\\'ll have a drug that\\'s looking good but it\\'s going to take five more years and by the way we brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that but it takes years to get it approved your people that are terminally ill if they have money they go to Asia they go to Europe they go all over the world looking for help if they don\\'t have money they go home and they die and what we did is a thing called right to try people signed something and they don\\'t hold the country responsible they don\\'t hold the drug company responsible let\\'s go right to try and they get the newest and the best and the latest medicine works looking good but you\\'re not gonna happen for five more years and you know why they didn\\'t do it because they didn\\'t want to hurt anybody except the problem is the people were going to die soon I said they\\'re terminally ill let him have it we sat down with a great group of leaders Republican leaders and honestly we had some bipartisan support and we got it done they\\'ve been trying to do it for 45 or so years and you have to see the results and I\\'ve seen some of the results some of the results are incredible and we\\'ve transformed veterans health care including through VA choice right VA choice for 48 years they\\'ve been trying to get veterans juice I thought I had the greatest secret you know I haven\\'t been doing this that long so four years ago I\\'m campaigning for president everyone said no he\\'s only having fun he\\'s only some fun this is a lot of fun but for 45 years they\\'ve been joined to get it veterans joys so I come back one day I say to my people I have the greatest idea I am so smart I am like this smart I have an idea because the veterans are waiting online they\\'re waiting on line for 2 weeks 3 weeks 4 weeks 10 weeks similar ok and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see their doctor is too long and I said folks I have the greatest idea who all of my people I say F the greater said you\\'re so smart here\\'s what we\\'re gonna do we\\'re gonna send to all those people that can\\'t see a doctor we just can\\'t get up to see a doctor we\\'re gonna send them down the road to private doctors and we\\'re gonna pay the bill and they\\'re gonna get fixed up but you see I said I was smart and they look back at me and they said sir we\\'ve known about that concept for 45 years we just can\\'t get it approved but I got it approved and I got it approved about 11 months ago and the VA is doing fantastically well our veterans are doing great that was a big thing that was a big thing we also got accountability where people could mistreat our veterans do whatever they want they could be sadistic they could be so many other things they could steal they could rob we couldn\\'t do anything you\\'d keep them you couldn\\'t do a thing we got accountability now you look at him you say get the hell out of here you\\'re fired now you can fire they\\'ve let go of more than 8,000 bad people we have reduced opioid deaths for the first time and very substantially in 30 years and we are modernizing critical vaccines were doing a great job with vaccines we are creating a pathway to buy drugs from Canada that are much much cheaper in Florida Governor Ron de santis came to me he said sir this system is so bad and you can\\'t fix it unless you have Democratic votes that\\'s why you got to both the house you got to get us back the house they say sure we can buy the drugs in Canada for 50% less the same drug made in the same factory made by the same company 50% and we can give the benefit for the people that live in Florida or Colorado or New Jersey or wherever you want and no president has been going on for a long time no president has wanted to do it you know how long it took me to make that decision I said if you can save 50% or 25% of 15% buy it do it go and I gave him authorization do it and we are protecting Medicare for our nation\\'s seniors Democrats want and you know this Democrats want to raid Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants and you know we all have a heart but when you we all have a heart but when you tell people to come into our country like this clown Governor of California come into our country come they\\'re all going to come if they think they\\'re going to get free education free health care they\\'re all going to come if you don\\'t say it they\\'re not going to come because they wouldn\\'t even think who would even think this virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth and that is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption look at what\\'s happening to this it is Los Angeles what it\\'s so sad what you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they don\\'t take care of the homeless San Francisco you could take it starting in New York you could take a look at what\\'s happening to our cities run by Democrats it\\'s a disaster they don\\'t know what the hell they\\'re doing the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family and the American dream Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race religion color and Creed we are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement that\\'s what it is it\\'s one of the greatest a moment it\\'s probably the greatest movement in history the 2016 election was probably I mean you could say the greatest election in the history of our country and now we have to do it again to keep it going it\\'s like a giant tree you plant it but it takes time to grab on we need this next election so badly the good news is it\\'s much easier because here I\\'ve done it all I\\'ve achieved more than I promised I never told you about space force we got space for I never told you about all of these things that we go we are a big tent party in the true idea it\\'s big ideas and we have a big future together this country has tremendous potential if we don\\'t blow it to give former prisoners a second chance at life we passed bipartisan criminal justice reform they came to me they couldn\\'t get it done including many conservatives and these people that I fight every day they came to me help help help criminal justice reform I got it done as soon as I got it done they don\\'t even want to mention my name I got it done I got people to vote for that they could have never gotten President Obama tried he couldn\\'t get it done President Bush couldn\\'t get it they couldn\\'t get it done that\\'s okay they couldn\\'t get it done I got it done and after I got it done and I mean solely got it done and after I got it done they have news conferences the thinking people that I never even heard of the only one they didn\\'t thank was President Trump and I got it done that\\'s that\\'s why I always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it and we\\'re fighting to give school choice to every child in America who needs it during national school choice week we reaffirm that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school school short very important Democrats don\\'t want them to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 brand-new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written and two great Supreme Court justices two great ones as we rebuild our military we have authorized over 160 million dollars to support our wars at a place called ha McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix have you ever heard of those planes have you ever heard of those places New Jersey 160 million dollars two great places I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights nobody else was going to do they\\'ve been trying to do that one for 52 years for years you watch as your politicians apologized for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Jersey my friends at stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation I really mean that it\\'s the survival of our nation and if you would have had the other party winning this last election instead of your market being up 72 percent instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you can\\'t even believe where your wife or your husband says darling you\\'re the most brilliant person in history four years you\\'ve been losing your ass with 401ks now you\\'re making a fortune right now you\\'re making a fortune I have people coming up to me all the time I had one gentleman come up sir thank you sir you\\'ve made me look so smart my wife never respected me for anything not anyway but now she thinks I\\'m a great investor 401 K if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020 we have to [Applause] and by the way when we talk about inheriting victory and 2020 in our nation just so you understand under a big tax cut biggest tax cut plan in history guess what you have you have a business you have a farm you have a small business no more inheritance tax no more what we call it that so if you love your children they won\\'t have to mortgage the plant they won\\'t have to mortgage the farm as the expression goes they won\\'t have to mortgage anything there\\'s no tax if you don\\'t love your children don\\'t leave it to them and then you do have a problem now I\\'m all okay does anybody here not love their child or their children because if you done this one-man basic is it now that\\'s a big thing no more estate tax no more death tax for your small farms and business those are things that people don\\'t even realize only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all and I never even knew this swamp was this bad Swamp is bad bad people a lot of bad people in the swamp they had people in the swamp we got a lot of bad people in that swamp that swamp those swamp creatures they call it they are what\\'s step by step way Galaga you thought this was going to be easy right a lot of bad people with your help we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare-to-work dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity that\\'s what\\'s happening in our heart together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration that\\'s what\\'s happening now we will enact trade deals the greatest deals ever made that result in more product proudly stand with that beautiful phrase made in the USA beautiful for decades we had politicians that didn\\'t care about that phrase that phrase didn\\'t mean anything to we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic can you believe this in America in ten years or less we\\'ve already started the process that it could have been started sooner by the past administration they chose not to do it I chose to do it think of that ending the AIDS epidemic within ten years that we\\'ve started we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms which is under siege by the way our Second Amendment is under siege in Virginia they want to take your guns away it\\'s just the beginning never gonna happen as long as I\\'m president of the United States that I prepare but above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one American we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government bureaucracy are the true American ways and we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag and we will always live by the words of our national motto In God We Trust [Applause] thank you everybody thank you very

Iowa unemployment rate has reached an all-time low in history it\\'s not fair that\\'s that then oh let\\'s vote for Pocahontas let\\'s vote for Bernie let\\'s vote for Sleepy Joe he\\'s faultless Joan he always gets the name wrong how many times has he missed it he\\'s in Iowa\\'s is great to be in the great state of Ohio I they say Joe you\\'re in Iowa you can\\'t do that no matter how great you speak if you\\'re Winston Churchill if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech it\\'s over you might as well just wrap it up there\\'s the fake news they were just absolutely [Applause] they would absolutely destroy you you can\\'t do that you can\\'t do that Joe sleepy Jill but you have these guys you have these people how about boot edge edge who that judge they call the mayor Pete you know why because nobody can pronounce his name nobody has any idea who Ned\\'s it\\'s they say say edge edge and he presides over a city that\\'s failed its Joey so battling in a state that\\'s having the greatest year they\\'ve ever had and they have a great governor also and they had a great governor you just heard from him right a great state of Indiana so I don\\'t see that one go down the line we have some people unless that talk about him what happened to many Mike worthy he\\'s not running he\\'s skipping four or five states many Mike I\\'ve had him up to here more people are working right now in Iowa than ever before now think of it think of it yesterday we replaced an after disaster with the incredible brand-new US Mexico Canada agreement and the USMC a you know when you have a hard time with that one you know memory is a great thing I\\'ve always had a great memory for whatever reason but memory is a great thing having a great memory but sometimes you take like little clues USMC a thank you darling I love you too where is that person look at that Wow what a good strong boy but you know how you remember it the song I just walked in on there playing the song YMCA so when you have it a hard time drew what\\'s your said just think of the song YMCA and your USMC a it\\'s a massive win for Iowa farmers and workers of all kinds it\\'s a massive win and it creates some fairness with Canada it creates fairness with Mexico probably the biggest reason that Iran was the unfair trade that I\\'ve seen and one after one China Mexico Canada Japan South Korea we\\'ve made all these deals and we have plenty left over [Applause] Europe Europe Europe is next I wanted to finish China before we started on Europe I\\'d like to do them one at a time you know one at a time I\\'m a very organized person but weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with China that will boost American agriculture by fifty billion dollars every year and many other businesses like manufacturing banking finance overall 250 billion and you know with the farmers because I have a place in my heart for the farmers big I went in and I saw ambassador lighthouse who\\'s in charge he\\'s fantastic I said what are you doing we\\'re getting ready for the final deal what are you doing he said I\\'m putting in twenty billion because I asked sonny perdue is great you know who he is right Secretary of Agriculture I said Sonny what\\'s the biggest number that China\\'s ever done with the farmers he said sir 16 billion last year 16 billion this was two years ago I said so 16 billion is the biggest because you know they targeted you and now we\\'re friends with you\\'re in fact maybe we\\'ve never had a better relationship and we\\'re working with them very closely on the coronavirus we\\'re working with them very very closely we only have five people hopefully everything\\'s gonna be great they have somewhat of a problem but hopefully it\\'s all gonna be great but we\\'re working with China just so you know and other countries very very closely so it doesn\\'t get out of hand but it\\'s you know it\\'s something that we have to be very very careful with right we have to be very fair but I said to sonny perdue Secretary of Agriculture I said Sonny what\\'s the number 16 and 12 the year before and you were targeted I don\\'t blame Johnny you know look they\\'re smart they\\'re negotiators they targeted Trump States whether they love Trump they love him in Miami they love him and the breast guy they love them and all these day they love him in Wisconsin they love him we won Wisconsin they liked him in Wisconsin and a lot of the farm states and they targeted and the farmers came to see me and they said sir you have to do what\\'s right and when the fake dudes would interview farmers the farmers would say no no president Tripp is doing the right thing it should have been done years ago should have been done years and years ago but you couldn\\'t have made it because there was too much money 16 billion so what I did is I put a twenty five percent tariff on everything coming in from China two hundred and fifty billion and then more tariffs on things beyond the two hundred and fifty billion dollar market we took in billions and billions and billions of dollars we still are and then what happened when I heard about the farmers and I saw the farmers they were in the White House they came to see me at 36 farmers and I said I\\'m gonna give you they said sir we don\\'t want anything they said what do you mean you don\\'t want anything I\\'ve never heard that before everybody wants money they want everything they said we just want a level playing field I never forgot it they said we don\\'t want anything we just want a level playing field and we\\'ve been treated badly two years [Applause] and and I said well you haven\\'t been given a level playing field for many many years for decades you haven\\'t been given a level playing field we\\'re gonna give you the level this field and you have our but but in the meantime I\\'m gonna give you 12 billion out of these tens of billions that were collecting don\\'t worry we had plenty left over because we never got 10 cents from China China took from us we didn\\'t take from China right I said I\\'m gonna give you 12 billion for the year before and I\\'m gonna give you 16 billion for this year that was last year for this year so they got meaning a lot of you in this audience God 12 billion and you got 16 so you got 28 billion dollars over that\\'s you\\'re at period of time and you were able to actually in some cases I guess thrive and I told Sonny I want to take care of the small farmer too not just the big monsters I want to take care of everyone but I never forgot when CNN fake news and all these people they go around interviewing the farmers they could never find anyone saying bad about Trump they go into diners what do you think about Trump isn\\'t it terrible what he\\'s doing with the trade and the farm would say no he\\'s doing what should have been done 20 years ago and now you people are gonna make so much money you\\'re not gonna do just you know what just relax take it easy put it away enjoy your life but you\\'re gonna make a lot of money you\\'re gonna make a lot of money and again we have never had because they respect us now they didn\\'t respect us we have never had a better relationship with China than we do right now it\\'s a beautiful story they respect the whole world respects us now we\\'re respected again America is respected again and we\\'re fighting for products made in America and grown right here in this great great state of Iowa to keep America safe we have fully rebuilt the United States military it\\'s now stronger more powerful more lethal than ever before we have all brand-new equipment and it was all built in the USA and thanks to the courage of American heroes the Isis Caliphate has been totally destroyed and its founder and leader the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead and crazy Nancy Pelosi said don\\'t call him an animal he\\'s a human being no he\\'s an animal he\\'s an animal and two weeks ago at by direction the United States military delivered another historic win for American justice our brave warriors launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world\\'s number one terrorist kasym so Lavinia Qasem Soleimani he was the mastermind of the roadside bomb he loved roadside bombs when you see your friends and great soldiers of our country and other countries frankly walking around they don\\'t have legs they don\\'t have arms in some cases some cases they don\\'t have both you see them walking around or riding around or the most brave people these people have the greatest attitude I go to Walter Reed and I see him and a young man his legs were blown off and how you doing sir I want to get back I want to get back to I\\'ll tell you the spirit of these people it may even top the farmers may even top the but he was responsible more than anybody else 90% they say of these roadside bombs sent to fight us he was responsible and he took a hard hit he took the very hard he was responsible for murdering and maiming thousands and thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of other people not acceptable so limini was actively planning new attacks but we ended his bloody rampage forever yet Washington Democrats true like crazy Bernie and Nancy Pelosi opposed our decision to eliminate Solomon II and to save American lives that had a tremendous impact well we\\'re proudly creating jobs and killing terrorists congressional Democrats are consumed with partisan range and obsessed with a deranged witch-hunt hoax you know we\\'re having probably the best years that we\\'ve ever had in the history of our country and I just got impeached can you believe these people I got it Beach they impeached something the best trade deals the strongest military took care of the vets we got choice we got accountability for the vets accountability we got all these things and they impeach the president no that\\'s not gonna work watch just watch they want to nullify you ballets poison our democracy and overthrow the entire system of government that\\'s not happening I can tell you that Washington Democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the last election I\\'m not why am I not worried I should be Lord you know remember Nixon it was like a dark period right a very dark period it was like oh you think about it right and with Clinton it was not good they say that with Johnson it was a long time ago none of us remember but they say it was a very dark period this is a happy period for us [Applause] it\\'s a happy player it\\'s a happy bird because we call this impeachment light this is like crazy ship shifty ship he\\'s a sick he\\'s a sick puppy he\\'s a sick puppy but you know what today you saw it I hit my highest poll numbers since I got elected because the American people and frankly people all over the world know it\\'s a hoax they understand it they know it\\'s a hoax and we have a great party the Republican Party they know what\\'s going on they know what\\'s going on are they going to treat us very fairly but the Democrats are trying to overturn the last election we will make sure that they face another crushing defeat but in 2020 November 3rd November 3rd mark it off November 3rd market or was that a great day 2016 November my fur he\\'s not gonna do well with this group I did well he\\'s not gonna do well with that group I won that group he\\'s not gonna do well here what they\\'re even the exit polls they took it right up you know what they didn\\'t know about the exit polls when people are leaving they\\'re always very accurate you know people leave who you vote if I\\'m voting for Trump who you\\'re voting for I\\'m voting for crooked Hillary I don\\'t care that she\\'s a stone-cold crook I\\'m voting for so who are you voting for I\\'m voting for Trump or Clinton or Trump and they\\'re always very active but this time something many people many men miss I like that idea [Applause] wouldn\\'t we like to run against her water get hurt no who\\'s tougher her crazy Bernie biting wound edge edge who would be the closest who\\'d edge edge I don\\'t know maybe we take another crack at crazy Hillary would that be okay she was so easy remember that speech so innocently given talking about deplorable remember remember deplorable but you know the only thing I didn\\'t understand I said that\\'s terrible but she said another word that was worse irredeemable and I said boy shows you how good I am in politics I said she\\'s in trouble she said our people are irredeemable to me that was worse well it wasn\\'t that word that caught on it was deplorable the next day I\\'m speaking and women are walking around I\\'m deplorable I\\'m everyone\\'s got deplorable I say I think she made a bad speech last night but irredeemable remember she called them deplorable and irredeemable and me being so brilliant i said i think that irredeemable is gonna get her no it deplorable daughter a lot of things got her like lack of ability together we are going to win back the house we are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep that beautiful gorgeous incredible White House people don\\'t realize there\\'s a lot of work you know I just left Michigan and Michigan is booming now because of me meaning I think I say to Prime Minister obvious a friend of mine Shinzo Japan you got to do something you got these massive deficits for our country you got to open up plants and Michigan fast and so fast you got to do it here oh yes I will do it he\\'ll do it and he\\'s doing it countries are coming in from all over the world they\\'re going to Michigan they\\'re coming to Iowa they\\'re buying you stuff again like crazy like crazy they go to Ohio they\\'re going to Pennsylvania they go into South Carolina they\\'re going to North Carolina they\\'re going to Florida they\\'re coming in like never before they\\'re all coming back I ran on the issue train I ran on a lot of different issues but trade was one of them that was so big to me he was so big I used to say how do we allow these companies to close fire everybody go to another country Mexico wherever it may be make product sell the product into our country pay no tax who the hell would allow this to happen [Applause] it\\'s like in South Korea I went to him I said listen you dealers no good we have to make a new deal South Korea we\\'re protecting them with all these different things I said number one you gotta pay us more they agreed to they gave us five hundred million that was your more they said but nobody is ever as they gave us five hundred that\\'s nothing a bit what they have to do it that\\'s okay that\\'s okay they\\'ll pay more but you know they made a trade deal with the United States Hillary Clinton was in charge of the deal right and she said it\\'s going to produce 250,000 jobs and she was right 250,000 you know who it was for for South Korea not for us it was for South Korea so we renegotiated the deal if I have your permission we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with South okay this deal is going to produce to remember this deal is going to produce 250,000 jobs for South Korea she didn\\'t lie can\\'t say she lied she lies about a lot of other things but you know how is she taking her defeat okay remember the debate do you promise if you lose that you will support the winner and I saw I didn\\'t exactly say yes I said I didn\\'t say yes it or face but I got you know sort of like 68 percent there but she said see he won\\'t - she\\'s the one that doesn\\'t do it no no I feel badly cuz it\\'s too late for her to get in I kept hoping but I think honestly I think that sleepy Jo crazy Bernie I don\\'t even want to put booted edge in but I think that actually be tougher than her during this campaign season the good people of Iowa have had a front row seat to the lunacy and the madness of the totally sick left this is a radical left people that were doing it today\\'s Democrat Party I don\\'t say Democratic Party it sounds so much better in a speech like Democratic for the Democrat but that set their name it\\'s called the Democratic Party you know some people aren\\'t allowed to say the Democrat Party because it doesn\\'t sound good I don\\'t even like it I don\\'t like the way it sounds into speech but I\\'m gonna say because I\\'m not looking to have them look good today\\'s democrat party is run by left-wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes increased regulations cancel your health plans raid Medicare shut down American energy destroy your Social Security they will destroy the associates occur eliminate religiously punish free speech confiscate your guns abolish your borders and in Doctrine a America\\'s children with hateful left-wing ideology other than that they\\'re okay other than that they\\'re fine people in short this election is a choice between American freedom and democratic socialism and in some cases in my opinion it\\'s worse than socialism socialism \\'he\\'s a kind word by comparison the democrats will lose because america will never be a socialist country we can\\'t [Applause] they\\'re all watching tonight they\\'re sitting in the hotel room little hotels right right down this tree and they\\'re looking at this crowd the press never talks about my crowds did you see in New Jersey a couple of nights ago we had signups for a hundred and seventy five thousand people we had an arena that held about nine thousand people we could have sold it out like 15 times okay they don\\'t talk about that you know what they talk about they say Donald Trump who spoke before a nice crowd if birdie or sleepy Joe has I mean Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table no they\\'re in a gymnasium they were in a gymnasium and they set up a round table and people that went did I hear his feature now being is what do you think of socialism they just said if I just want to be here to watch a speech they set up around tear book as the crowd was sensible and then the saint was a brilliant round table it was wonderful they never mentioned crowds you know they never mention crowds they never mentioned anything I\\'ll tell you SMC a the biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world okay it is way it barely got any mention we signed it it barely got any mention they talked about the impeachment hoax they talked about all the other stuff but the trade deal that\\'s going to change your country it\\'s going to bring growth way do you see toward the end of next year the growth will be astronomical because of the China trade deal the u.s. MCA Japan South Korea Europe when that happens it will happen because they have no choice but in the papers and on the fake dudes campus shows and the regular look NBC is horrible the NBC Nightly News it\\'s terrible the good news is people don\\'t watch it like they used to because they don\\'t believe in it they don\\'t believe in it and as Sean Hannity would say Ms DNC you know what MS DNC is right so bad CNN total fake stuff oops a camera just went off look the camera it just went off [Applause] [Applause] they camera just went off that always happens whenever I say CNN their camera goes off but Americans across the political spectrum were disgusted by the Washington Democrats the partisan hoaxes the witch hunts the con jobs it\\'s all a con job and so they don\\'t love our country I swear they don\\'t you look at Nancy Pelosi\\'s district in San Francisco it was so beautiful and now it\\'s a disgrace being watched all over the world needles all over the place everything else all over the place I\\'m not going to get into it washing down into the ocean washing down onto their beaches people living in tents if they\\'re lucky I mean you never saw anything living on their most important entry ways into what was a great city San Francisco what\\'s happened and all she does is work on the hooks and work on all of the stuff really these people are very very bad for a country we have to take back the House of Representatives we have registered Democrats and independents are leaving the Democrat Party in droves and we are welcoming these people and these great voters to the Republican Party with wide open arms and we are thrilled to be joined tonight by a lot of your great leaders a lot of your really wonderful people I\\'m not gonna mention all the names cuz you know

world\\'s tallest campaign manager Brad parse cow and Republican National Committee co-chair who\\'s done an incredible job Tommy Hicks and we have the great negotiator the great man Bob light Heiser with us here sometimes what a job he did negotiating for you and we have somebody that you never heard of somebody that\\'s a fantastic person but you never heard of somebody named Sarah Sanders have you ever come here Sarah that\\'s pretty good and we have a great football player from Iowa Matt Whitaker\\'s here Mack [Applause] thank you how much do we love this president and mr. president how much do we love the state of Iowa so much this is an incredibly special place I actually met my husband here in Des Moines so I love being back in Iowa it\\'s an amazing place we\\'re sorry you\\'ve had so many crazy Liberal Democrats running around here the last year but the good news is it\\'s not gonna matter because at the end of the day this guy will still be our president [Applause] thank you Sarah very popular she was terrific person great person so thanks to Republican leadership America now has the hottest economy anywhere on the planet Earth not even close every Prime Minister president King Queen dictator whatever you want to call them they all say how did you do it and you know the truth is we have certain advantages but we also have a people advantage we have the greatest people in the world I really worry since the election we have created seven million new jobs the average unemployment rate under my administration listen to this is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country can you african-american Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded think about more than 2 million Millennials you know what Millennials young great people with a lot of future they\\'ve gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5% annually that\\'s a record another record is that between the ages of 25 and 34 people are now working and that\\'s a record the number of people 25 to 34 and under the so-called Trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of any group and that\\'s a great thing this is a blue-collar boom and that\\'s a good thing too that\\'s a good thing earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% for the first time ever for the first time ever and median household income is at an all-time high just for one second President Bush eight years four hundred and fifty dollars President Barack Hussein Obama eight years eight years nine hundred and seventy five dollars President Donald John Trump two and a half years not three because the numbers were taking it to it I have now it\\'s actually higher two and a half years including the tax cuts which are massive and including all of the regulatory cuts and the other things you\\'ve gotten $10,000 so you have eight years for 58 years nine seventy five two and a half years think of it ten thousand dollars it\\'s one of the reasons the economy is doing so well and let the people down the road tell you about that okay and let them tell you about that and those tractors that I told you to buy your tractors will be 60 years old if they have anything to do with it there\\'ll be 60 years old they\\'ll be old tired exhausted your land will be exhausted you\\'ll be exhausted we\\'ve ended the war in American energy the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth by far we\\'re also proudly promoting American ethanol and I recently approved a 15 to be used all year round biofuel also but the socialist Democrats want to shut down American energy they support representative occasion Cortez that\\'s a real beauty that\\'s a beauty I can\\'t even believe it but I don\\'t want to knock it because the green new deal which would crush our farms destroy our wonderful cows I love cows they want to kill our cows you know why right you know why don\\'t say they want to kill our cows that means you\\'re next and they want to wipe out totally Iowa ethanol they want to wipe it out but we will never let that side get in and by the way that\\'s the least of it but I don\\'t want to attack the green new deal because they might change it I said to the other day they said what do you think of the green new deal I said well it should be studied carefully we should look at it look at it closely I don\\'t want to talk about it till about two months before the election and then I\\'ll tell you how totally insane it is how about this crazy senator how about this crazy crazy senator from Hawaii they said I\\'m totally in favor not the smartest she said I\\'m totally in favor of the green New Deal well you know that would mean there\\'s no more airplanes oh so they started screaming at her in Hawaii they said out of hell are we gonna get the Hawaii they said we\\'re gonna build a railroad she said the world\\'s longest track it\\'s the world\\'s long she doesn\\'t know that they don\\'t want airplanes anymore and yet they fly around in brand-new Gulf streams and brand-new planes all over the place they\\'re flying from place to place they\\'re talking about the carbon footprint we\\'re gonna destroy the carbon footprint what time is my plane thank you not pleased to lift up forgotten communities the Republican tax cut launched Opportunity Zones jobs and investment are now rushing into over 60 news-leader and this is incredible brand newly designated opportunity zones right here in Iowa alone rich people are investing vast amounts of money Tim Scott senator Tim Scott South Carolina came into my office he said I have an idea that I\\'ve wanted to do for years but we\\'ve never had a president they could pull it off I said what is it Tim and he talked about opportunity so it\\'s first time I heard it and we did it and there is nothing nobody\\'s ever seen anything like it money is being poured into these communities that would have never been there what\\'s happening is incredible opportunity zones remember it for decades politicians ran for office promising to protect American farmers and workers you\\'ve heard it all your lives right but then they went to Washington they looked at those beautiful marble columns and that gorgeous ceiling painted and all that gold you know the way they used to build the buildings they don\\'t build them that way anymore we could but they just don\\'t know how by the way we\\'re building the wall you know the Wolves over a hundred it\\'s over a hundred miles long already and moving fast so they went to Washington and they sold you out that\\'s what happened they sold you jobs out they sold everything out global as politicians allowed other countries to raid our factories ravaged our farms robbed our workers and ransacked our communities but the era of economic surrender is over because now we are finally putting America first [Applause] before I took office Washington looked the other way while China stole our secrets from American agriculture you know your business what they do scientifically nobody understands what they\\'ve done to a seed it doesn\\'t sound complicated it\\'s genius what they\\'ve been able to do what you\\'ve been able to do but those secrets were being stolen stolen and installed massive barriers to your exports you couldn\\'t do anything with exports so people not only China many many other places were stealing your secrets our new agreement with China will protect our intellectual property and pry open vast new markets for American beef pork poultry seafood soy beans rice dairy and much much more [Applause] but you know it is true China is so big 1.5 billion people we have 350 1.5 billion people think of that and that\\'s just which is touching that this deal will be so big if it all works out and you have the best product the best product in the world if it all works out it will just keep expanding 250 billion will end up being much much more than and you know I\\'ve told the story before when we were signing we were almost finished and they said how much of the farmers getting meaning how much are they going to purchase from the flowers and ambassador Leiter had said we put twenty twenty billion so the highest-ever was sixteen so we made it twenty I said make it fifty they say what and then people even farm people said sir we can\\'t produce that much I said that\\'s a good problem not a bad problem I said make it fifty so we now have in the contract from forty to fifty billion dollars worth of purchase [Applause] right Jared I said you better make it 50 I want those farmers to come back say sir sir we can\\'t do it we can\\'t produce that much sir what are you doing to us I don\\'t think that would ever happen do you think that whatever I said they\\'ll figure away he\\'s going absolutely not no I said don\\'t make it 20 make it 50 the u.s. MCA is another colossal victory for American agriculture like you\\'ve never had before it\\'s time you know we suffered for a year and a half almost two years think of it but not really because I was able to give you those I won\\'t call them subsidies that made that mistake once with the farmers I said that this group of farmers that came in subsidy I used the word subsidy that was the worst word sir we don\\'t like subsidy please don\\'t ever use that word I said I won\\'t they promise but we helped and it will increase total agriculture exports by more than two billion dollars and you only think of that including the huge dairy in Iowa dairy pork and poultry alone so 2 billion just in those small just in that small little grouping when you were doing nothing it\\'s called promises made promises kept [Applause] promised has been so you know the last time I came I never did this before I never ran so they all said he never ran before you can\\'t do this if you never ran so whatever happened it happened one by one they started dropping out right and then I was left with one Hillary Clinton and that worked out very nicely he cannot get to 270 remember 270 electoral college he cannot get to 270 I went to Maine it\\'s true Maine - he\\'s got one point right one I went there a lot many times everyone said well they kept getting me maybe if I have a great night - 69 but 269 loses right but we got 306 - - twenty-three-oh-six so they were right you cannot get to do 70 you can get to 306 but not that is in the 8 years before my election net farm income plummeted by 20 percent you know that I got here if you look at a chart for 15 years actually not 8 for 15 years it\\'s like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer soybeans take a look at it all it was just a one-way street everybody was ripping off the American farmer now you\\'re gonna see numbers that are going to be great look at even what\\'s happened recently it\\'s incredible what\\'s going on and I love it because you deserve it you suffered a lot with people that were stupid they was stupid under three years of my administration net farm income has already gone up nearly 50 percent and will now be rising even faster what are you gonna do you\\'re gonna vote for Bernie you\\'re gonna vote for Bernie here I am on the debate stage well net incomes gone up for the farmers 50% tell me how the hell do I lose this debate how do I lose and based on the polls I guess I\\'m not gonna lose in this state I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna lose in any other state because this is really true all over the country this is happening all over the country not just Iowa well know is you have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people that on immigration illegal immigration costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars drains public services over crowds our schools and hospitals and threatens innocent American lives at a number that you wouldn\\'t even believe but we\\'ve got it closed up but we\\'re getting your people in you have people that have worked for you for a long time don\\'t yeah I know who the people the gap and they\\'re hard workers we have a lot of great people you have a lot of great people out there right here in Des Moines a twice deported illegal alien was charged with shooting and killing a woman her 11 year old daughter and her five-year-old son in this region of the county last year ice officers arrested nearly 4000 illegal aliens charged or convicted of heinous crimes including robbery rape and murder yet today\\'s democrat party glorifies illegal immigration we have no idea now we do now but people would come in by the hundreds of thousands we have no idea who they are many are fine people and all of that but some are stone-cold rapists and murderers and people that their countries don\\'t want who are Amala Honduras El Salvador and even Mexico right now we have a love affair with Mexico because the Democrats the Democrats wouldn\\'t give us what we needed and I got Mexico they\\'re great they put up twenty seven thousand soldiers on our southern border and the numbers are plummeting 87 percent down so the President of Mexico is doing a great job and we ended catch and release you think that was easy catch and release you know what catchy releases you catch a criminal you take the number and you release them into the they never come back we say come back please in three years this is a Democrat deal come back if you don\\'t mind in three years we release him into our country we totally ended it through a very very slick group of tax and release may we please have your address and your phone number he writes what have you done we I got out of jail oh well welcome to the United States please we have a little information okay now we\\'re gonna release you and in three and a half years we scheduled a court appearance for you do you believe that this is the only country in the world they catch somebody in the border you\\'re supposed to be Perry Mason you take them to court other countries catch somebody at the border they say sorry you got to get out we say oh may we have your information we\\'re taking you to court man today\\'s democrat party glorifies illegal immigration vilifies the heroes of law enforcement and pledges to dissolve immigration control entirely they want open borders they want hundreds of thousands of people to flow into our country and some of those people some of those people are stone-cold killers some of those people in the caravans right I came up with that name they will give me credit for that they don\\'t give me credit for anything they don\\'t give me credit for fake news that wasn\\'t that my germ now they say I see CNN they said fake News has reported no no your fake news that fake this isn\\'t your fake news [Applause] they turned to Tamara they\\'re reporting that fake news is reporting their fake news left-wing politicians even support deadly sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly unto American communities we don\\'t want them in New York City the mayor sanctuary policy recently forced the release of a criminal illegal alien charged with assault after being set free the same criminal raped brutalized and murdered a 92 year old woman they wouldn\\'t give them to the Ice Warriors they\\'re warriors they\\'re tough and they love our country they\\'re very tough and they love our country and they\\'re taking ms-13 gang members they\\'re about as tough as you get they\\'re taking them out of our country by the thousands by the thousands and that\\'s a tough job but they love to do it they love our country sanctuary city policies are just wrong they\\'re immoral and illegal and they really are something that has to be stopped they have to be stopped now what\\'s happening is it just schools thankfully here in Iowa your great Republican governor sometimes referred to as governor Reynolds signed a statewide ban on sanctuary cities Thank You Kim and that is why we need to elect more republicans nationwide to end sanctuary cities in all 50 states Thank You Kim Reynolds [Applause] you know I endorsed her so I want to take full credit for the job Houston I endorse it very early very early I endorsed her I know Talent she\\'s done a great job Democrats stand for crime corruption and chaos Republicans stand for law order and justice we are finding the illegal gang members drug dealers predators and we are throwing them the hell out of our country ideally and we don\\'t want to put them in prison because you know what we got to pay for them for the next 50 years but sometimes we have to have there two dangers we have no choice thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row and they\\'re getting more and shockingly as that wall gets longer the crossings get less remember the Democrats you don\\'t need a wall you don\\'t need a wall you don\\'t need it seven years ago they all voted for it they just didn\\'t have the ability to build it you know it\\'s not easy with land and this and that and property and rights and they couldn\\'t figure it out but I can figure that the problem was we couldn\\'t get the money but we got all the money we need now we have everything [Applause] and you know the last time this last budget they didn\\'t really fight us on the wall you know why because they learned it\\'s a really bad issue for them it\\'s a really bad issue but I made one mistake with the wall I should have said we will never ever build the wall they would have given me so much money to build a wall that was my only because I used to go we will build the wall right and I was a mistake I should have said we will never ever build it under no circumstances and they would have forced this building and I was that okay and by the way in all due respect you know he\\'s gonna pay for the wall right oh no no they play that the fake displays no no through remittance illegal aliens from Mexico are gonna pay for the wall that\\'s what it is 100% because when I say something I mean it I said I was gonna build a wall and you think it\\'s easy when you have a party that controls the house you got to end that you got to end them you know they said they picked up the house at 18 but I didn\\'t run in 18 you know big difference when you run 16 I ran 18 I didn\\'t run and they did they picked up they picked up some seats I didn\\'t run but I\\'m running this time and we\\'ve got to take back the house and Kevin McCarthy will be a great speaker though Kevin McCarthy will be a great speaker watch but getting something built when you have a party that controls one of the three getting it built is I don\\'t honestly I don\\'t want to break nobody else could have done it nobody else could have done it and it\\'s the real deal wall it\\'s the wall that border security wanted remember I thought I could just build concrete slabs they didn\\'t want that because you have to be able to see through I said oh come on this is the expensive version this is the best version just a steel in concrete and rebar in between it\\'s it\\'s really something did you see the other day where drug dealers got caught at the top they couldn\\'t get over we had to get the fire department to get them down they couldn\\'t get over and they\\'re like mountain climbers they got used to climbing me they got caught because you know that panel that\\'s an anticline panel it\\'s very hot and very tough it\\'s a very hard panel to climb the panel on top sometimes they say you know I\\'d rather do without that panel because I\\'m a very visual person they said sir that\\'s anticline panel okay let\\'s anti-climb paddle and and the wall is the top of the line that\\'s what they wanted mostly 30 feet tall that\\'s very tall that\\'s maximum and it\\'s it\\'s really doing a big trick a lot wherever we have it here 100 miles is all of a sudden alive but what you have that it\\'s incredible 99.9 percent especially when we\\'re watching it while watching the sections illegal crossings now are down 75 percent since last spring and the powerful border wall is we\\'re starting to set I mean pretty soon we\\'ll be setting records in speed it\\'s going up very rapidly very rapidly and you\\'re seeing it all over and it\\'s gonna be really something very look it\\'ll be nice if we didn\\'t have to have it it would be great but we have to have it you know they said oh we could have drones Oh what are you gonna do drones flying around when people are going through your border with no what they could have drones flying around and they know because they were all for it they were all afford now all of a sudden they\\'re guests but they want drones well we\\'re gonna have drones too but the drones are policing the wall and people in terms of human trafficking people don\\'t even talk about it the worst because of the internet sadly the worst in the history of our world all over the world trafficking in women and children all over the world all over the world the worst it\\'s ever been but when we have this border it makes it very very tough for them to come into the United States with women and with children stuff in trunks in the back of a car and the Washington Democrats have never been more extreme 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders government health care takeover bill to take over of your health care that would strip all of those 180 million great Americans of your private coverage you want that you got great deals you\\'re able to negotiate you were able to keep your doctor keep your area keep your hospitals keep everything that you wanted now they want to take it away report to an operating room when you have a cold okay in your local hospital I don\\'t think so 180 million people but I\\'m not gonna knock it because I want Bernie to bring it right up to the end and we\\'ll debate it the day before the election okay we are saving your health care while socialist Democrats are trying to take away your health care and sleepy Joe has no idea what he\\'s even doing they dont he doesn\\'t even know what he\\'s talking about he\\'s so lost that honestly that poor guy is so lost they talk health care she said it\\'s over for him it was over for him actually if you knew him a long time ago now it\\'s really over we are making health care better and cheaper we got rid of the individual mandate the most unpopular thing which essentially killed Obamacare and we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions that we always will the Republican Party we\\'re stopping surprise medical billing and making everything totally transparent and I signed it already everything now is going to transparencies where hospitals doctors everybody has to tell you how much things are costing watch those prices come down [Applause] I have a a really an expert on health care he said transparency cuz it\\'s a big deal It\\'s a big deal nobody else would have gotten have done that I can tell you transparency is bigger than health care because you will see prices tumbling like you wouldn\\'t believe people go in for a blood test they get charged two thousand seven hundred dollars down the road they get the same test for fifty seven dollars the same exact test maybe it\\'s better maybe it\\'s better it\\'s crazy when you have transparency it\\'s all gonna come you watch you watch but this person a real expert said this is bigger than health care and I got it done unfortunately it won\\'t really start kicking in till after the election because it takes a period of time they have certain statutory requirements etc you better let me win can you imagine can you imagine I did transparency I took the guts I did transversal and then I\\'m gonna watch as somebody else\\'s didn\\'t he do a great job for transparency and you better let me win because I want the credit for that one we\\'re buying cheaper drugs from other countries and approving more generic drugs than ever ever ever before we are defending your right to keep the doctor we are defending your right to keep your plann remember Obama twenty eight times you can keep your doctor you can keep your doctor twenty eight you can also keep your plan you can keep it you can keep it twenty eight times he lied we should impeach him now he got it out alive he got it out alive but we\\'ve run it much better but essentially it\\'s totally different because of individual mandate because that really took the guts out of it and we\\'re running it much better I had a choice do we run it well I do runner poorly if we run it poorly everyone\\'s gonna blame me if we want it well everyone\\'s gonna give him credit especially the fakers back there right but you know what we got to run it well but we\\'re coming up with a health care that if we win the house we will have the best health care of any country in the world we\\'re fighting the lobbyists that were fighting the special interests in case you didn\\'t notice and we are serving only you and thanks to our bold reforms we\\'re now offering health plans that are 60% cheaper than Obamacare we\\'re offering a lot of different things and we have just passed recently ten months ago right to trial of right to trial you know what that is that\\'s people are terminally ill and they can\\'t use medicine because and they\\'ve been trying to pass this almost for 50 years you can\\'t use the medicine we have the greatest doctors labs hospitals in the world they come up with a medicine but it has to go through the FDA procedure right and you can\\'t do anything you can\\'t use it they won\\'t let you use it now I have you so in an agreement you\\'re not going to sue the United States you\\'re not good at this your family etc etc very simple and they can use it and you have no idea the results that are you have no idea the results people\\'s lives are busy and for me it was simple I said wait a minute you\\'re worried about hurting somebody these people are dying they\\'re terminally ill they\\'re admitting they\\'re terminally ill and you won\\'t let them use the drug that may work let them use the drug and we\\'re letting them use the drug and it\\'s working in a lot of case we have transformed veteran\\'s health care including VA choice the best you know I think I\\'m a totally brilliant human being I think I\\'m the smartest person so so I came up with a plan I\\'ll never forget I was in New Hampshire I came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and saying sir it\\'s really terrible what\\'s happening with healthcare we\\'re waiting in line for two weeks for four weeks for seven weeks honestly people were waiting in line they weren\\'t very sick they were terminally ill truthfully before they saw a doctor by the time they got to the doctor so I came up with this incredible plan only I could think of this I said here\\'s what you do here\\'s what you do if somebody can\\'t get a doctor quickly because we have great doctors at the VA they don\\'t get enough credit if you can\\'t get to a doctor quickly you go outside you go locally you get a doctor we pay the bill you get yourself all better right so I went back I went back and I told my people do you have any idea how smart I am listen to this plan I have they said actually sir we\\'ve known about that plan for 52 years we just couldn\\'t get it approved so I said ah that\\'s too bad I thought it was brilliant but what I am good at is getting things approved and I got it approved and people are using it and it\\'s [Applause] and I know the people of Iowa don\\'t care about this but we are making substantial investments in rural health care we are combating the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years that\\'s a great thing and our great first lady is helping us with that that is such a big thing for Melania big big thing she is really involved and we will never let the Democrats give away your health care to illegal immigrants especially when we say come in come in we\\'ll give you health care you know it\\'s one thing they come in it\\'s like a rough situation cuz we all have hearts but when you people are saying like in California this whacky governor he\\'s just come in we\\'re gonna give you health care we\\'re gonna give you free education we\\'re gonna give you everything we\\'re gonna give you a beautiful Rolls Royce C to show you how fake they are one of the newscasters and Donald Trump said that the Governor of California promised a Rolls Royce to illegal immigrants he didn\\'t promise them this was a lie and a misrepresentation by President Trump they can\\'t take a little humor they can\\'t take it these people are sick they\\'re sick there\\'s sick people them and shifty ship is a very sick person he lies awake at night shifting and turning shifting shifting and turning in his bed sweating like a dog how am I gonna kill him he didn\\'t do anything wrong how am I gonna get him oh what a sick guy he is virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth that is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God [Applause] Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption no matter how you cut it that\\'s what it is the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American Dream and the late great Abraham Lincoln you know that Abraham remember I always said I could be more presidential than any other past president other than perhaps Abraham Lincoln when he\\'s wearing the Hat right because it\\'s easier to be presidential but I only have about three people in front of me here good evening ladies and gentlemen is everything okay you know I see the world is ripping you off well there\\'s not a thing I can do about that thank you good night everybody good night now we got to do it the right way Republicans and by the way can I be honest doing this takes far more talent than doing that doing that is very easy this is not easy especially when you just left Michigan and you just left other places and you got maniacs doing a number on you all the time for three years you got the maniacs for three years I think before I came down the escalator with our future first lady I think really they were doing it then they started even before I came down on the escalator these people are maniacs oh you have all that so you\\'re fighting that and you\\'re doing farm bills we got your farm bill approved by the way I don\\'t even mention that because that\\'s massive by any other standard but it\\'s peanuts compared to the USMC and the China deal right so I don\\'t even mention it anyway Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race religion color and Creed it\\'s true and our numbers with African American workers people are through the roof remember I used to say what do you have to listen I\\'d read down the worst hood crime the worst an education they got this they got that they got ten different things Oh horrible and one day I\\'m in front of this tremendous group of people and I\\'m reading this list african-american they have the highest crime rate they have the highest this to have the worst education of the worst schools to have the worst I said stay with me because they were with the Democrats for a hundred years more I said stay with me what the hell do you have to lose [Applause] and now they have the best employment and unemployment numbers they have the best poverty numbers they have numbers that nobody would believe they\\'re doing so great it\\'s so great to see it it\\'s incredible youth unemployment african-american you been great we\\'re asking all Americans to join our incredible movement we are a big tent and a big party with big bold beautiful ideas for the future we\\'re what the country was based on originally it was called greatness it was and during national school choice week school choice everybody we continue our fight to rescue children trapped in failing government schools Iowa became one of the first states to pass school choice that was over ten years ago now governor Reynolds senator Ernst senator Grassley and more than 100 members of Congress are supporting our plan to give school choice to every child in America who needs it it\\'s a great way to give former prisoners the second chance at life we passed criminal justice reform think of that think of that we had a lot of great conservatives wanted it we had liberals wanted if they couldn\\'t get it passed President Obama couldn\\'t even come close he didn\\'t try too hard he talked like Oh while trying to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges of record who will interpret the Constitution as [Applause] and two great Supreme Court justices by the way and as far as right to great ones as part of my commitment to rebuild our military we secured an 8.5 million dollar facility to support our Iowa Guardsmen at Camp Dodge right here in Des Moines Iowa right here camp Dodge can\\'t dodge everybody and take care of Camp dogs I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and yesterday we just released a historic new plan for peace we\\'re gonna see if we can get that done it\\'s one of the toughest tales of all one of the toughest deals but if we have a shot at it for years you watch as your politicians apologized for a country they apologized they would say I\\'m sorry now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Iowa we are standing up for Iowa at stake in our present battle is the survival frankly of our nation look you know I can make this speech really short all I have to do is say hello Iowa you have no choice you have to vote for me otherwise everything that you\\'ve built in your entire life will be gone goodbye Iowa have a good time instead I work my ass off up here okay through you think this is easy it\\'s a little hot in this room this room wasn\\'t designed for this many people if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020 we have to and by the way for those beautiful farmers that want to leave your small farms or businesses to your children because of our great tax bill the biggest tax cut in the history of our country the biggest that you benefit by because of that there is no death tax or inheritance tax so I always say if you love your children that\\'s a great thing if you don\\'t love your children don\\'t leave it to them and that particular text won\\'t matter what have you loved is there anybody here that does not love your children is there anybody here who loves your children well it\\'s Iowa it\\'s Iowa you love your children no you have no tax to pay you leave you you know in the old days meaning before Trump what would happen you\\'d leave your farm that assess your farm for a massive amount that kids would go out to a bank they\\'d borrow money up to they\\'re up to their eyeballs and they\\'d end up losing the farm now you can leave your farm and they did that to pay the tax now you can leave your farm you don\\'t pay inheritance tax or [Applause] so when you\\'re looking down at your children you\\'re saying well did you get lucky did you get lucky look at them they\\'re enjoying life but only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all that swamp is gone that swamp is bad I had no idea it was gonna be this sick and this degenerated it\\'s a degenerate swamp I had no idea when I came out I said we\\'re gonna drain the swamp I had no idea that swamp was that evil but we\\'re winning we\\'re winning because we\\'re in the White House with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare-to-work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity that\\'s what\\'s happening all over our country together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration it\\'s already happening we will continue to enact new trade deals that resulted more products made raised farmed and grown right here in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than ten years we\\'ve already started should have been started in the last administration incredible should have been started earlier but we started in less than 10 years the AIDS epidemic will be eradicated we\\'ll be gone who thought who would\\'ve thought who would\\'ve thought that was possible when they came in here told me that a couple of years ago I said really nobody knows that incredible the strides that we\\'ve made we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms [Applause] in the state of Virginia they want to take your guns away you believe it Virginia I love Virginia of all set they want to take your guns away the Democrats it\\'s not gonna happen above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America we are one great American we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that family and faith not government bureaucracy are the true American Way not government bureaucracy we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to

plummeting crime is falling confidence is surging and our country is thriving and highly respected again America\\'s enemies are on the run America\\'s fortunes are on the rise in America\\'s future is blazing bright the years of economic decay are over the days of our country being used taken advantage of and even scorned by other nations are long behind us Ganju are the broken promises jobless recoveries tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth power and prestige in just three short years we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of Americans destiny we have totally rejected the downsizing we\\'re moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never ever going back I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been our military is completely rebuilt with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world and it\\'s not even close our borders are secure our families are flourishing our values are renewed our pride is restored and for all of these reasons I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress the state of our union is stronger than ever before the vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world\\'s most prosperous and inclusive society one where every citizen can join in America\\'s unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America\\'s extraordinary rise from the instant I took office I moved rapidly to revive the US economy slashing a record number of job-killing regulations enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker pro-family pro-growth and most of all pro-american thank you we are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race color religion and Creed very very high since my election we have created 7 million new jobs 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration the unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century and very incredibly the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any Administration in the history of our country if we hadn\\'t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success the unemployment rate for african-americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history african-american youth unemployment has reached an all-time low african-american poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years and last year women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added the veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low the unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in US history a record number of young Americans are now employed under the last administration more than 10 million people were added to the Food Stamp rolls under my administration seven million Americans have come off food stamps and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare in eight years under the last administration over 300,000 working age people dropped out of the workforce in just three years of my administration 3.5 million people working age people have joined the workforce since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent three times faster than the increase for the top one percent after decades of flat and falling incomes wages are rising fast and wonderfully they are rising fastest for low-income workers who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election this is a blue-collar boom real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded since my election US stock markets have soared 70% adding more than 12 trillion dollars to our nation\\'s wealth transcending anything anyone believed was possible this is a record it is something that every country in the world is looking up to they admire consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs all of those millions of people with 401ks and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60 70 80 90 and 100% and even more jobs and investments are pouring in to nine thousand previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones a plan spearheaded by senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts in other words wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven\\'t seen investment in many decades creating jobs energy and excitement this is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this it\\'s all working Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran tony Rankin\\'s from Cincinnati Ohio after struggling with drug addiction Tony lost his job his house and his family he was homeless but then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones he is now a top tradesman drug free reunited with his family and he is here tonight Tony keep up the great work Tony thank you Tony our roaring economy has for the first time ever given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start the second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn\\'t be done but I got it done and the people in this room got it done [Applause] thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign the United States has become the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far with the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years America is now energy independent and energy jobs like so many other elements of our country are at a record high we are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago likewise we are restoring our nation\\'s manufacturing might even though predictions were as you all know that this could never ever be done after losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built companies are not leaving they are coming back to the USA the fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is in the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is one of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal in fact unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for president following NAFTA\\'s adoption our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs many politicians came and went pledging to change or replace NAFTA only to do so and then absolutely nothing happened but unlike so many who came before me I keep my promises we did our job six days ago i replaced nafta and signed the brand new US mexico canada agreement into law the u.s. MCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying american auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers ranchers and factory workers it will also bring trade with mexico and canada to a much higher level but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity we will have that fairness and reciprocity and I say that finally because it\\'s been many many years that we were treated fairly on trade this is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America\\'s labor unions I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China\\'s massive theft of America\\'s jobs our strategy has worked days ago we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA for decades China has taken advantage of the United States now we have changed that but at the same time we have perhaps the best relationship we\\'ve ever had with China including with President Xi they respect what we\\'ve done because quite frankly they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year decade after decade without someone in our country stepping up and saying that\\'s enough now we want to rebuild our country and that\\'s exactly what we\\'re doing we are rebuilding our country as we restore American leadership throughout the world we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere that\\'s why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba we are supporting the hopes of Cubans Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to restore democracy the United States is leading a 59 Nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro Maduro is an illegitimate ruler a tyrant who brutalizes his people but medoras grip and tyranny will be smashed and broken here this evening it\\'s a very brave man who carries with him the hopes dreams and aspirations of all Venezuelans joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate president of Venezuela juan guido mr. president please take this message back to you Thank You mr. president great honor thank you very much please take this message back heck that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom thank you very much mister thank you very much socialism destroys nations but always remember freedom unifies the soul to safeguard American liberty we have invested a record-breaking 2.2 trillion dollars in the United States military [Applause] we have purchased the finest planes missiles rocket ships in every other form of military equipment and it\\'s all made right here in the USA we are also getting our allies finally to help pay their fair share I have raised contributions from other NATO members by more than 400 billion dollars and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled and just weeks ago for the first time since President Truman established the air force more than 70 years earlier we created a brand new branch of the United States Armed Forces it\\'s called the space force very important in the gallery tonight we have a young gentleman and what he wants so badly 13 years old in lawn Faye he\\'s an eighth grader from Arizona Ian please stand up ian has always dreamed of going to space he was the first of his class and among the youngest at an Aviation Academy he aspires to go to the Air Force Academy and then he has his eye on the space force as Ian says most people look up at space I want to look down on the world but sitting behind Ian tonight is his greatest hero of them all Charles Magee was born in Cleveland Ohio one century ago Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen the first black fighter pilots and he also happens to be Ian\\'s great-grandfather [Applause] credible story after more than 130 combat missions in World War two he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam on December 7th Charles celebrated his 100th birthday a few weeks ago a signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General and earlier today I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office general McGee our nation salutes you thank you sir from the pilgrims to the founders from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King Americans have always rejected limits on our children\\'s future members of Congress we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people the people are the heart of our country their dreams are the soul of our country and their love is what powers and sustains their country we must always remember that our job is to put America first the next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American dream yet for too long countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools to rescue these students 18 states have created school choice in the form of opportunity scholarships the programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list one of those students is Jenaya davis a fourth grader from philadelphia Jenaya geneious mom Stephanie is a single parent she would do anything to give her daughter a better future but last year that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania\\'s governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children Jenna and Stephanie are in the gallery Stephanie thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter thank you very much but Jenai I have some good news for you because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over I can proudly announce tonight that an opportunity scholarship has become available it\\'s going to you and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice now I call on Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity janilla has just received passed the education freedom scholarships and opportunities act because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow for this reason our magnificent first lady has launched the b-best initiative to advance a safe healthy supportive and drug-free life for the next generation online in school and in our communities Thank You Melania for your extraordinary love and profound care for America\\'s children thank you very much my administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background through our pledge to American workers over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans my budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation\\'s high schools tonight I ask Congress to support our students and backed my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America to expand equal opportunity I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation\\'s historically black colleges and universities a good life for American families also requires the most affordable innovative and high quality health care system on earth before I took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years I move quickly to provide affordable alternatives our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better I\\'ve also made an ironclad pledge to American families we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security always the American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills that is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency many experts believe that transparency which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year will be even bigger than health care reform it will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care but as we work to improve Americans health care there are those who want to take away your health care take away your doctor and abolish private insurance entirely 132 lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans to those watching at home tonight I want you to know we will never let socialism destroy American health care over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded health care to millions of illegal aliens forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders these proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration that is what is happening in California and other states their systems are totally out of control costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money if forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you then stand with the radical left but if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government health care for illegal aliens this will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where as we speak a long tall and very powerful wall is being built we have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time early next year we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed my administration has also taken on the big pharmaceutical companies we have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before and I was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years the costs of prescription drugs actually went down and working together Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels I\\'ve been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done and done quickly and properly I\\'m calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices get a bill on my desk and I will sign it into law immediately with unyielding commitment we are curbing the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years among the state\\'s hardest hit Ohio is down 22% Pennsylvania is down 18% Wisconsin is down 10% and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all protecting Americans health also means fighting infectious diseases we are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the corona virus outbreak in China my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat we have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease Alzheimer\\'s and those struggling with mental health and because Congress were so good as to fund my request new cures for childhood cancer and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness here tonight is a special man beloved by millions of Americans who just received a stage four advanced cancer diagnosis this is not good news but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet rush limbaugh thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country and rush in recognition of all that you have done for our nation the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country\\'s highest civilian honor the Presidential Medal of Freedom I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor please [Applause] ruch and catherine congratulations Thank You Catherine as we pray for all who are sick we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs in 2017 doctors at Saint Luke\\'s Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive born at just 21 weeks in six days and weighing less than a pound ellie schneider was a born fighter through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents little ellie kept on winning the battle of life today Ellie is a strong healthy two-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery Ellie and Robin we are glad to have you with us tonight le reminds us that every child is a miracle of life and thanks to modern medical wonders 50% of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where le was born now survived it\\'s an incredible thing thank you very much our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like le that is why I\\'m asking Congress to provide an additional 50 million dollars to fund neonatal research for America\\'s youngest patients that is why I\\'m also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late term abortion of babies whether we are Republican Democrat or independent surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God as we support America\\'s moms and dads I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave serving as a model for the rest of the country now I call on Congress to pass the bipartisan advancing support for working families Act extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation 40 million American families have an average 2200 dollars extra thanks to our child tax credit I\\'ve also overseen historic funding increases for high quality childcare enabling 17 states to help more children many of which have reduced or eliminated their wait lists altogether and I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high quality childcare and urge you to act immediately to protect the environment days ago I announced that the United States will join the 1 trillion trees initiative an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world we must also rebuild America\\'s infrastructure I asked you to pass senator john burroughs highway bill to invest in new roads bridges and tunnels all across our land I\\'m also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed Internet including and especially in rural America they better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe that means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level including our nation\\'s heroic ice officers last year our brave vice officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries 5,000 sexual assaults 45,000 violent assaults and 2,000 murders tragically there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens in sanctuary cities local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ice to be safely removed just 29 days ago a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92 year old woman the killer had been previously arrested for assault but under New York sanctuary policies he was set free if the city had honored ices detainer request his victim would still be alive today the state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sting January for criminal illegal immigrants a very terrible sanctuary with catastrophic results here is just one tragic example in December 2018 California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests including convictions for robbery and assault but as required by California sanctuary law local authorities released him days later the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence he viciously shot one man going about his daily work he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest he walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon he hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles critically injuring innocent victims one of the victims is a terrible terrible situation died fifty one-year-old American named rocky Jones rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range murdering him in cold blood rocky left behind a devoted family including his brothers who loved him more than anything else in the world one of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight Jodie would you please stand Jodie thank you Jodee our hearts weep for your loss and we will not rest until you have justice senator Tom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jodi to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices I asked Congress to pass the justice for victims of sanctuary cities act immediately the United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not criminal aliens in the last three years Isis arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers and I have side nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the Menace of human trafficking domestically and all around the globe my administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States before I came into office if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested you were simply released and allowed into our country never to be seen again my administration has ended catch and release if you come illegally you will now be promptly removed from our country very importantly we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala as a result of our unprecedented efforts illegal crossings are down 75% since May dropping eight straight months in a row and as the wall rapidly goes up drug seizures rise and the border crossings are going down and going down very rapidly last year I traveled to the border in Texas and met chief patrol agent Raul Ortiz for months agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers and rescued more than 2,000 migrants days ago agent Ortiz was promoted to deputy chief of Border Patrol and he joins us tonight chief Ortiz please stand a grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of border patrol and ice thank you very much to build on these historic gains we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit welcoming those who follow the rules contribute to our economy support themselves financially and uphold our values with every action my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Thank You Mitch and his colleagues in the Senate we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written this includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh thank you and we have many in the pipeline my administration is also defending religious liberty and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools in America we don\\'t punish prayer we don\\'t tear down crosses we don\\'t ban symbols to faiths we don\\'t muzzle preachers and pastors in America we celebrate faith we cherish religion we lift our voices in prayer and we raise our sights to the glory of God just as we believed in the First Amendment we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country so long as I am president I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms in reaffirming our heritage as a free nation we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation now we must embrace the next frontier America\\'s manifest destiny and the Stars I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars my administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism last week I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians recognizing that all past attempts have failed we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future three years ago the barbarians of Isis held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria today the ISIS territorial Caliphate has been 100% destroyed and the founder and leader of Isis the bloodthirsty killer known as al Baghdadi is dead we are joined this evening by Carl and Marcia Muller after graduating from college their beautiful daughter Cala became a humanitarian aid worker she once wrote some people find God in church some people find God in nature some people find God in love I find God and suffering I\\'ve known for some time what my life\\'s work is using my hands as tools to relieve suffering in 2013 while caring for suffering civilians in Syria Kayla was kidnapped tortured and enslaved by Isis and kept as a prisoner of al Baghdadi himself after more than 500 horrifying days of captivity al Baghdady murdered young beautiful Kayla she was just 26 years old on the night that US Special Forces operations ended al Baghdadi\\'s miserable life the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general mark Milley received a call in the Situation Room he was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name Task Force 8:14 it was a reference to a special day August 14th Kayla\\'s birthday Karl and Marcia America\\'s warriors never forgot Kayla and neither will we every day America\\'s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart one of these American heroes twas Army Staff Sergeant

very much thank you both very much the terror is responsible for killing sergeant hake was Kassim Soleimani who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chrissy\\'s life Sal Imani was the Iranian regime\\'s most ruthless butcher a monster who murder or wounded thousands of American servicemembers in Iraq as the world\\'s top terrorists allamani orchestrated the deaths of countless men women and children he directed the December dassault and went on to assault US forces in Iraq was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard and that\\'s why last month at my direction the US military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Salamone and terminated his evil reign of terror forever our message to the terrorists is clear you will never escape American justice if you attack our citizens you forfeit your life in recent months we have seen proud Iranian \\'he\\'s raised their voices against their oppressive rulers the Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons stop spreading terror death and destruction and start working for the good of its own people because of our powerful sanctions the Iranian economy is doing very very poorly we can help them make a very good and short time recovery it can all go very quickly but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help we are here let\\'s see which road they choose it is totally up to them as we defend American lives we are working to end America\\'s wars in the Middle East in Afghanistan the determination and valor of our war fighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress in peace talks are now underway I am NOT looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan many of them totally innocent it is also not our function to serve other nations as law-enforcement agencies these are war fighters that we have the best in the world and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all we are working to finally end America\\'s longest war and bring our troops back home war places a heavy burden on our nation\\'s extraordinary military families especially spouses like amy Williams from Fort Bragg North Carolina and her two children

of hard-working patio who believe in God family and country thank you thank you and I\\'ll tell you what we have more in this arena and I hate to say this to you we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in so if you\\'d like to give up your seat or way you\\'re standing sorry we couldn\\'t get your seats but if you want to give it up let them come in you go out does anybody want to make that deal I don\\'t think so but we have more in this arena and outside of this arena then all of the other candidates meaning the Democrats put together and multiplied times and the fake news these guys will never report that they\\'ll never they don\\'t even like showing the crowd they always show my face they never show the crowd but you know what the people can hear the crowd the people can hear the crowd they know that is not the sound of 200 people one of their prime candidates today they worked a big deal they had exactly 104 people and the fake news said it was a nice crowd very nice if I had one empty seat here one empty seat in this massive arena they\\'d say he didn\\'t sellout but you know what we have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and I came down the escalator never and we have the biggest arenas in the country with your help of November 3rd we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats we are going to win New Hampshire in a landslide this is a truly incredible time for America we have the best economy we\\'ve ever had the most prosperity we have got the most prosperity we\\'ve ever had by the way we\\'re gonna keep it that way do it\\'s okay and we\\'ve just built the most powerful military anywhere in the world that was totally depleted now it is all brand-new jets it\\'s got brand-new missiles and rockets and everything you can imagine and if it hasn\\'t been shipped yet it\\'s going to be shipped soon on Tuesday I delivered my address on the State of the Union and I had somebody behind me who was mumbling terribly mumbling mumbling wah-wah oh he was mumbling very distracting very distracting and I was very distracting I\\'m speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me angry there was a little anger back there where the one should be angry not them we\\'re the ones that should be angry but we proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback our country is stronger today than ever before and the day after my address our good Republicans in the United States Senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full complete and absolute total acquittal and it wasn\\'t even close and I want to thank our Republican senators in our Republican House members they were tremendous in the house we won 196 to nothing and then we got three Democrats and in the Senate other than Romney we had we got 52 to nothing 52 to nothing at something and in one case we got 53 to nothing but I don\\'t even count that to be honestly the radical left pathetic partisan crusade has completely failed and utterly backfired with 18 votes think of that 18 votes to spare with a lot of votes to spare and also very importantly as of today I we because it\\'s we it\\'s that I it\\'s we it\\'s all world in this together we have the highest poll numbers that we have ever had Thank You Nancy very much while the extreme left has been wasting America\\'s time with this vile hoax we\\'ve been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages and acting fair trade deals securing our borders and lifting up citizens of every race color religion and Creed from our rural communities to our cities we are expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens we added another two hundred and twenty five thousand new jobs last month alone lazy and I listened I watched I had all these experts they would say yes I think 60,000 another one said one hundred one thousand another one said one hundred and twenty-five another one was one hundred and eighteen and then the number came out two hundred and twenty five thousand pretty good we have destroyed the Isis Caliphate we killed the founder and leader of Isis al Baghdadi is dead now Baghdady is dead and we just took out the world\\'s top terrorist Kasim soleimani ending his evil reign of terror forever the fact is America is respected again it won\\'t die but as we keep on winning Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds they\\'re crazy that\\'s why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement they\\'re joining our great Republican Party now I can\\'t tell you what\\'s happening tomorrow because you do you have some pretty strange election laws here right remember last time we won the primary tremendously we should have won the election but that buses being shipped up from Massachusetts hundreds and hundreds of and it was very very close even though they did but this year we you know you have a great governor governor Sununu great Governor Chris and now you get prosecuted if you do what they did so it should be a lot different but we have done great this has been an incredible state for us it\\'s a state where the people are great just great people and we hear that there could because you have crossovers and primers don\\'t you so I hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats is that make sense you people wouldn\\'t do that my only problem is I\\'m trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate I think they\\'re all weak we proudly welcome and embrace voters of all parties and political persuasions who want to join our mission a very simple mission remember make America great again and then after we make it great again which we already have we\\'ve had a hundred and forty-one days where the stock markets have reached their all-time historical high 141 think of that out of three years 104 and to me I view it differently well I look at your 401ks I mean how who is doing well with their 401 K up 90 percent up a hundred and four percent is there anybody doing badly with the 401 K I\\'d like to not talk to that person does anybody have a 401 K where they\\'re doing badly please don\\'t put up your hand I don\\'t believe it now the 401 KS they\\'re up 90 percent 95 percent I always tell the story people come up to me they say I want to thank you my wife thinks I\\'m a total loser sir she thinks I am the worst person with money with financial she thinks I\\'m just horrible in the last three years I\\'m up 94 percent sir she thinks I\\'m a total genius when it comes to fire she loves me again she didn\\'t love me before sir she loves me again that tells you something about money doesn\\'t it the first step to victory in November is tomorrow ghosts and a message that Republicans and you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want don\\'t worry about it I don\\'t really think we actually have a candidate against us that Republicans are energized that were United and that nine months from now we are going to take back the House of Representatives we are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House you know they always talk about the Democrats they have enthusiasm right we have so much more enthusiasm than that\\'s not even close they\\'re all fighting each other they are all going after each other you got them all over the place they don\\'t know what the hell they\\'re doing I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing they can\\'t even count their votes we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by

7 million new jobs the unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in a half a century the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country you believe that way that\\'s pretty amazing that\\'s pretty amazing the unemployment rate among african-americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached record lows all-time never been lower than what it is now and by the way our poll numbers with African Americans with Hispanic Americans with Asian Americans the other side is getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships they\\'re going up African American youth unemployment so important it was a horrible number a few years ago you remember was a really terrible thing was happening it\\'s just reached the lowest time in the history Louis the best number in the history of our country and african-american poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded wages for african-american workers have increased by 2400 dollars per year also a record and you know this for decades the Democrat Party has betrayed African Americans they\\'ve betrayed us all they betrayed all of us but we\\'re delivering for African Americans we\\'re delivering for Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans like nobody has ever done we are fighting for great jobs great schools great health care at a truly great future for our country and for them we are the party of equal opportunity for all Americans thank you to support working families we\\'ve reduced the cost of child care expanded paid leave and given 40 million American families an average of 2200 dollars more in their pockets thanks to the Republican child tax credit who would have thought that we have cut more job-killing regulations than any admin you know this one so you go back four years eight years in one case longer than eight years we\\'ve cut more job-killing regulations than any other Administration in the history of our country and we\\'re not finished and we\\'ve ended the war on American energy they want to take our energy away they want to take our wealth away they want to give us wind wind if it blow is wonderful if it doesn\\'t blow you got problems a wind they want to destroy our country sides put windmills all over them watch your house go down and value you ever see what happens they build a windmill within distance of your house you can forget about your house you could just say well that was the end of that investment you want to see a bird graveyard go to the bottom of a windmill take a look the graveyard for birds they kill all the birds lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump that\\'s what we\\'re doing we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies Washington politicians I mean you know this they shuttered New Hampshire factories you were one of the worst examples ever after what NAFTA did to to your communities I mean to your state is incredible shattered your communities and sacrifice your jobs on the altar of globalism we can forget Lobel ISM we want to take care of our country New Hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the WTO the World Trade Organization one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country for decades politicians campaigned across this state promising to replace NAFTA they lied they never did it they never even tried to do it they wouldn\\'t have been able to anyway it wasn\\'t easy I will tell you that but then they got elected and they did absolutely nothing but I\\'m not like those other politicians I keep my promises we took care of it we took care of it last month we ended the nest you saw last month being bye-bye I say Donald J Trump bye-bye NAFTA we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I saw the brand new US Mexico Canada agreement into law that\\'s going to be great for our manufacturers our farmers great for everybody great for our workers the u.s. MCA will bring jobs back to New Hampshire right where they belong they should have never left in the first place probably the number one reason I ran for office I\\'m one for one I have friends some of these great senators say look at Lindsey over there look at Iran these great senators so I\\'ve run five times than I\\'ve won three another senators it sir I\\'ve won seven times sir southern senator I won seven times sir and I\\'ve won five of those damn contests I said senator I ran once and I won just one and we\\'re gonna run twice and that\\'s gonna be it although they think we\\'re gonna run much more than that you know that it scares the hell out of the fake news I will tell they can\\'t take a joke I also took the strongest ever action to confront China\\'s massive theft of American jobs and our strategy work massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in Porton by the billions and billions we never took in ten cents from China they ripped us so much you wouldn\\'t believe it now they respect us again last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defeat so many of our opponents the money that\\'s pouring in people don\\'t even believe it and by the way the virus they\\'re working hard looks like by April you know in theory when it gets a little warmer and miraculously goes away hope that\\'s true but we\\'re doing great in our country China I spoke with President Xi and they\\'re working very very hard and I think it\\'s gonna all work out fine rough stuff I tell you rough rough stuff but I think it\\'s gonna work out there we only have 11 cases and they\\'re all getting better but our trade agreement with China will defend our workers protect our intellectual property and substantially boost exports of american-made goods is that nice after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country or no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than a thing called immigration right before I came into office the far left policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and that\\'s what they want I see them campaigning right down the street it\\'s really boring to watch but I try and watch now I have an obligation to watch really boring stuff but they want open borders they want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom are not exactly what we\\'re looking for okay I mean murderers rapists and some other things they\\'re going to be poisoning our children with drugs including right here in New Hampshire and you have one of the biggest drug problems in the country and we brought it down 18% but we have to do better 18% Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the well-being of American citizens they want to let anyone into our country from all around the world just come on in folks we\\'re going to give you free health care we\\'re going to give you free education we\\'re going to give you more than I that\\'s a getting we\\'re going to give you every family will get a free Rolls Royce you know I said that Matt I said that to them and some of the fake news picked it up and they said prisoner Trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand-new free Rolls Royce he lied he lied he live they gave me a Pinocchio they don\\'t get it Matt to they met actually they get it better than we understand they get it very well they get it they know what\\'s happening and the wall is being built I will tell you when the wall was and you know they went after a son everybody knows the wall is going up so what\\'s happening you know you do know who\\'s paying for the wall don\\'t you redemption from illegal aliens that are coming in the redemption money is paying for the wall they\\'re so sad to hear that cuz it\\'s okay finally they go you have to understand an entire party is fighting they\\'ll give me anything I want our military will rebuilt at 2.2 it\\'s really 2.5 trillion dollars over a period of three years they give me anything but not ten cents for the wall they said we like drones well drones don\\'t keep people out drones are wonderful they fly around take pictures we\\'re gonna give you the drone no good so we now have built over 100 miles of wall and well we have that wall built you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that don\\'t come in I say the allele if they can\\'t come in they don\\'t come in so we up to over a hundred substantially more than a hundred miles of wall and that will have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future and by the way you have to see you wouldn\\'t believe it you have to see what happens when that wall goes up you have to see the numbers change like magic they change like magic it\\'s called you know you ever hear the thing you know with all the modern technology all of the new computers the new genius the new everything cyber this cyber that two things never change right a wheel and a wall oh really the law they\\'re gonna have a lot of brilliant people working over the years they\\'re never gonna replace the wheel and they\\'re never gonna replace the wall and it\\'s a high wall illegal immigrants coming in coming into our country illegally very few of them are getting in right now you know Mexico has been terrific we have 27 thousand Mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers went down 87% from this year and this time last year for the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants we could rebuild the cities in America we could rebuild our cities but you know I have something because if people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies we\\'d the snake the snake did anybody does anybody know what I\\'m talking about she knows she\\'s been standing outside for four days don\\'t wonder and you look good I\\'ll tell you what four days outside in the rain and snow look at these front row people these are warrior they\\'re warriors too like my congressman and Senator so this is because we mentioned at least a I made minor changes they mentioned illegal immigration this is about immigration this is this was a song from the 1950s Al Green and they mentioned little changes to it that\\'s okay but they mentioned illegal immigration right and I used to do this a lot and people couldn\\'t get enough of it to be honest with you and I haven\\'t done it for a while and I thought I\\'d do it tonight because you\\'re on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders they want open borders and we don\\'t want open borders we want very strong closed borders and we want people to come into our country but they want to come in through merit and we want them to come in Legally right right through merit and legal right so we\\'ll do this quickly this is illegal immigration it\\'s called oh listen to how quiet it is listen to how quiet now watch how quiet it gets get so quiet but this is all about I love you too there was a guy that said that but I love him too I love everybody ready so important illegal immigration on our way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the do poor things she cried I\\'ll take you in and I\\'ll take care of you take me in Oh tender woman take me in for heaven\\'s sake take me in an o tender woman side the vicious snake she wrapped him up o cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk she hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake she\\'d taken in had been fully fully revived take me in Oh tender woman take me in for heaven\\'s sake take me in Oh tender woman side that vicious snake she clutched him to her bosom you\\'re so beautiful she cried but if I hadn\\'t brought you in by now you truly would have died she stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight but instead of saying thank you the snake gave her a vicious bite take me in Oh tender woman take me in for heaven\\'s sake take me in Oh tender woman side the vicious snake I saved you cried the woman and you\\'ve bitten me but why you know your bite is poisonous and now I\\'m going to die shut up silly woman said the reptile with a grin you knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in gotta come in legally and through merit under my administration we\\'re fully taking care of our own citizens first including millions of African American and Hispanic Americans who are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities in this region of the country alone last year ice officers we love our ice officers the Democrats don\\'t like the Democrats don\\'t like them ice officers are the toughest human beings and they love the country as much as anybody in this room last year alone they arrested over 2,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and murder over 2,000 accused of murder yet left-wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the American community one of my guests at the State of the Union was American citizen Jody Jones I introduced him that night his beloved brother Rocky was murdered by a criminal alien in California shot him eight times at close range wouldn\\'t stop Rocky\\'s killer had been previously arrested many many times but under California\\'s totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law authorities were ordered to set him free tragically left-wing politicians in New Hampshire trying to replicate California\\'s disastrous policies last year the Democrat controlled New Hampshire House blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state and by the way you have a great Governor Chris Sununu he\\'s on top of all he\\'s on top of them and his father\\'s a great guy\\'s father didn\\'t like me too much a few years ago once I won I\\'m telling you he was so good he was as good he fought like hell for us all of us it\\'s a great family and chris is doing a fantastic job if you want to shut down sanctuary cities if you want to protect your family and your loved ones you must vote Republican in 2020 November and thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row illegal crossings are down now at record numbers that we\\'ve ended catch and release you know catch and releases you catch an illegal alien by law you then take his name and address they don\\'t have addresses what\\'s your address what they don\\'t have addresses they come into the country they don\\'t have addresses so you take his name and then you have to release them into the country and you say we\\'ll see you in four years for your court case we never see them they never come back we have seized record amounts of drugs we have deported record numbers of gang members ms-13 by the thousands and we have done more to secure the border of our country than any Administration in history remember this Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking their cues from crazy Bernie 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie\\'s health care takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their very very coveted private coverage the Democrat Party wants to run your health care but they can\\'t even run a caucus in Iowa by the way it\\'s a week a week you know I turned on at seven o\\'clock I want to see who won they said there\\'s a little problem little did they know does anybody\\'s now await does anybody know who won Iowa I don\\'t know maybe rendered Lindsay Rand does anybody know who won not Lindsay you\\'re a total pro nobody knows he said nobody flip a coin flip a coin flip a coin they\\'re gonna run your health care unbelieva but nobody knows who won actually I think they\\'re trying to take it away from Bernie again I think Bernie came in second can you believe it they\\'re doing it to you again Bernie they\\'re doing it to you again we\\'re saving your healthcare while the socialist Democrats are trying to take away your health care we are making health care better and much much cheaper you\\'ve seen what we did we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will the Republican Party always will always will and we got rid of the most unpopular thing in the health care world the individual mandate we had to pay a fortune not to have pay a fortune you know you paid a fortune not to pay a fortune for bad health care and we got rid of it saved a lot of money for a lot of people and we\\'re stopping surprise medical bills and making everything transparent that\\'s bigger than healthcare transparency and that\\'ll go unfortunately into effect right around the election time it would be nice if we could get it earlier but it\\'s all done it\\'s all signed because when providers are required to show you what the prices are those prices are going to come tumbling down blood tests as an example one hospital has them for 53 dollars another hospital the same test two thousand four hundred and fifteen thousand and they it may even be better who knows we\\'re approving more generic drugs than ever before at any time in the history of our country that\\'s bringing prices we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan remember President Obama you can keep your plan you can keep 28 times you can keep your doctor that didn\\'t turn out very good we should impeach him for that why are we impeaching of 28 times you can keep your duck we should impeach President Obama Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism and blatant corruption the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American Dream and the late great Abraham Lincoln right Abraham Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community in every walk of life we are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm we love people we are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement people are signing up left and right but if you want to vote for a weak candidate tomorrow go ahead pick one pick the weakest one you think I don\\'t know who it is we are a big party with big ideas for the future very big we become a big party and an open-minded party and we\\'re the party\\'s people like we\\'re the hot party and we\\'re the party with all the enthusiasm we are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school we pass criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life most incredible thing that\\'s happened prison has never really had a shot they get out they couldn\\'t get a job no matter what they did and they go back they go back to their ways they had no I mean in many cases I guess they had no choice it was a disaster now they\\'re getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what we\\'ve done with criminal justice reform and other things like Opportunity Zones etc they\\'re getting jobs and employers are loving them they\\'re doing great they\\'re doing they are doing great first time ever they\\'re not going back to Paul the rule of law we have confirmed 191 federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written and as you know we\\'ve also confirmed two great new Supreme Court justices thank you very much thank you Rand Thank You Lindsay thank you we have invested 2.2

it done and four years you watch as your politicians apart are they really it I mean they went out I\\'d like to apologize for the behavior of the United States no no we don\\'t apologize anymore now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of New Hampshire thank you at stake in our present battle is the survival actually of our nation if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have toward victory November 3rd 2020 only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all and I will tell you that swamp is much worse than I thought when I was out here innocently campaigning let\\'s drain the swamp that swamp is a lot worse than anybody ever thought that Swamp is a dirty swamp that\\'s a dirty swamp you have some really evil dirty horrible people like to say nice everyone\\'s as I said not good did not good people but we\\'re draining that sucker slowly but surely with your help we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare-to-work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system of immigration we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly

who believe in God family and country thank you thank you and with your help this November we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Arizona in a landslide it\\'s all over TV that the folks here tonight have helped a great World War two veteran into the arena I don\\'t know if he knows it but he\\'s right now the hottest celebrity in the world I don\\'t know what\\'s gone he might even be hotter than Trump right now I have to say did you see the scene no he\\'s all over television even fake do CNN Hannibal [Applause] but they say he\\'s a legitimate great hero of World War two Irvin Julian Urban thank you [Applause] and I asked my son Don to get a couple of hats and get some things and give him to orwen right now and I want to thank you really that\\'s a great honor and thank you for the great job you\\'ve done an American patriot thank you very much Thank You Don how did Don do tonight okay is good good guy and he loves this country so this is truly an incredible time for America we have the best economy the most prosperous country that we\\'ve ever had and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far it\\'s by you remember the good time we had a week ago at the State of the Union you remember that that what was my honor but I proudly declare that we are in the midst of the main American comeback country is stronger today than ever before and after three years a very unfair and ridiculous witch-hunt and partisan Democrat who say it was the radical left pathetic attempts to nullify your ballets poison our democracy and overthrow our entire system of government but guess what they failed in our polls numbers are higher today than they\\'ve ever been before and we\\'re standing up to the defense of our Constitution our freedom and democracy itself we\\'re doing something that\\'s never been done in the history of our country this movement has never taken place nothing like it ever and the fake dudes can attest to it because if they thought I was saying the wrong thing it would be out there immediately be all over the place it would be all over the place Trump exaggerated such terrible what he says there has never been a movement like this and it began very early it began in 2016 with that wonderful beautiful night you remember that right that beautiful night in November and we\\'re gonna have another beautiful night in November and this time it\\'s going to be November 3rd get ready November 3rd will come [Applause] so we\\'re having great polls you\\'re seeing the polls except for some of the fake ones and if I was treated fairly meaning if you were treated fairly by the fake news we\\'d be up 20 points higher in the polls there wouldn\\'t even be a competitive election unfortunately it\\'s probably going to be competitive but I actually think we\\'re going to win by a lot just like we did last time but I really believe would be up 20 points I mean all they do is negative negative phony stuff Russia Russia Russia the impeachment hoax that\\'s a hoax but you know we had great support from the Republican Party in the house it was 197 to nothing and in the Senate it was 52 and a half to a half you know the half was a half-wit and while the extreme left has been wasting America\\'s time with the hoaxes we\\'ve been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting for trade deals securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race color religion and Creed and by the way they turned away 21,000 people outside so feel very good feel very we haven\\'t had an empty seat you know what we haven\\'t had - we haven\\'t had an empty seat and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobody\\'s ever seen but we haven\\'t had an empty seat since you\\'re great and this is a great first lady came down the escalator with me in Trump Tower a long time ago we haven\\'t had an MPC from our rural communities to our inner cities we\\'re expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens we added another two hundred and twenty five thousand new jobs last month alone you saw that the geniuses you saw that you saw that last month they were doing predictions of one of the shows what do you think well I think 6,000 what do you think I think 100,000 what do you think I think 84,000 these are the ones that tell you all about how to invest what do you think and then they came out 225,000 the market goes up again [Applause] 225,000 so many manufacturing jobs so many that frankly we\\'re never going to come back to remember you need a magic wand right they came back and remember this we\\'re paying interest the past administration didn\\'t pay interest they pumped money in like it was candy and we didn\\'t pump money and we took money out I\\'m not that I was happy about that because I disagree with it because frankly if we kept the old practice which frankly some people could dispute one way or the other we would have been in my opinion another 10,000 points in the Dow and we\\'ve said a hundred and forty-four records on the stock mark and in three years 144 records 24 records records Akbar you know that means that\\'s your 401 days are up 60 70 80 90 100 % [Applause] well guys come up to me said mr. president I just want to thank you my wife used to look at me like I was a total loser sir every year we lost money for years and years he said what the hell is wrong with you Henry and this year sir I\\'m up 92% she loves me again she thinks I\\'m a genius 92% 401 K she thinks I\\'m a genius sir she loves me again shows what money can do right but that makes and think of this 7 million new jobs since we we were elected we were elected and when I took over Isis was all over the place and we immediately started we have destroyed 100% of the Isis Caliphate we have killed the founder and leader of Isis al Baghdadi is dead and we just took out the world\\'s top terrorists Kassam soleimani ending his evil reign of terror forever [Applause] and the factors does I want to tell you that they don\\'t want to tell you in fact you remember the dog great dog Conan when we took out rides we love Conan Conan\\'s a tough dog but when we took out al Baghdady Conan remember this Conan got more publicity than president Trump that\\'s okay they were looking for al Baghdadi for 16 years we fed him and we took him out and last week last week but we killed on the one last week the head of al Qaeda he was gone dead and America is respected again respected like never before we\\'re respected again we\\'re no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country including by the way our allies who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies I will tell you that they take big advantage but not so much anymore we\\'re winning we\\'re winning like never before Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds they hate the fact that we\\'re winning we\\'re winning big we\\'re winning winning winning [Applause] and that is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement they join our great Republican Party in droves you see it all the time I just spoke to some of your leaders he said this is unbelievable what happening this is unbelievable you know there have never been rallies like that sleepy Joe Biden the other day had 68 people and now they have a new member of the crew mini Mike mini month no boxes we call them no boxes and I hear he\\'s getting pounded tonight you know he\\'s in a debate I hear they\\'re pounding you he spent five hundred million dollars so far and I think he has 15 points it just came out hey fake news how many points does he have right now 15 they won\\'t tell you the truth they won\\'t tell you the truth MSDN see MS DNC is worse than CNN they\\'re owned by a company called Comcast you can have Comcast a bunch of phonies but MS DNC is worse than CNN and they\\'re all pretty bad now they just came out with a poll they just came out with a poll a little while ago mini Mike was at 15 and crazy Bernie was a 31 that\\'s a lot and many might just spent 500 not but the DNC the DNC is going to take it away from Bernie again and that\\'s okay cuz we don\\'t care who tell it is we\\'re gonna win [Applause] let me try these crooked politicians really two way three years from us because despite the fact and nobody disputes it that we\\'ve done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything we\\'ve done

tremendous person a great fighter pilot a lot of people don\\'t know that she\\'s a great fighter pilot and a warrior Senate she helped us so much during the impeachment hopes she didn\\'t want it Martha Malley [Applause] you know Martha stuff in the border and she\\'s working with me to strengthen our military still further and lower your prescription drug prices that were making a lot of progress but her opponent I have to say this month a guy named Mark Kelly even the Democrats don\\'t like you much he wants to raise your taxes open your borders give away free health care to illegal immigrants and he wants to obliterate your second Amendment he wants to get rid of the radical Liberal Democrats from California and Massachusetts they\\'re pouring money into Kelly\\'s campaign because they know that he\\'s a rubber stamp for cryin Chuck Schumer crying shocked and nervous Nancy wakow Pelosi [Applause] and we\\'re gonna have a new speaker but that\\'s why Martha has my complete and total support and endorsement and we have to all get out there and make sure that martha mcsalley she\\'s a warrior let me tell you you don\\'t know we don\\'t know people don\\'t know people this one is tough as hell and that\\'s what we need martha mcsalley welcome back to the great state of Arizona I just want to say I have a message for the liberal hack media in the back [Applause] Arizona is going to vote in November to keep America great and send president ROM back to the White House [Applause] and mr. president I want you to know I was right there on the floor that amazing State of the Union address that you gave it brought tears to my eyes at many places you were honoring our veterans you were reunited it was extraordinary but I heard her call you said to put a bill on your desk that\\'s going to look for prescription prices and I\\'m going to introduce the bill next week to get that to help all Americans [Applause] Arizona is on fire thanks to the leadership of President shop with Governor Doug Ducey and the Republicans and the Senate in the house people are living amazing we are getting people off the sidelines economy is doing so great we have so much more to do but there\\'s so much at stake my opponent said he would vote to convict and remove you from Offutt and remove you from the 2020 ballot and then he said last week that he would support Bernie Sanders if he\\'s the nominee and his socialist agenda so um Arizona is tired of investigations they\\'re tired of obstruction they don\\'t want socialism they love our freedoms and he is Mark Kelly is flying on Bernie Sanders wing and I\\'m flying on your wing president Trump and we\\'re gonna win in November thank you mom Wow she\\'s right how about that congressman Al Green we can\\'t beat him so we have to impeach him how about that that\\'s not what our as they call them the founders how many times had year.the named the founders that\\'s not what the founders had in mind but we\\'re gonna have a big big election victory we\\'re working together I don\\'t think the Republican Party has ever been more unified than it is right now so whatever you can do for Martha we need her it\\'s been so incredible thank you very much and thank you for everything mom together we\\'re building the world\\'s most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere wind cluesive J Trump did you ever hear of him in only three years including regulation cuts and tax cuts because the other ones raise taxes we cut taxes by the record amount it went to $10,000 per family a record a record that\\'s why our consumer are right now our people they\\'re booming with cash and one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better China had the worst year in the last 67 years Asia\\'s doing poorly Europe is doing poorly the United States is doing great we\\'re doing the best we\\'ve ever done [Applause] the best we\\'ve ever done to lift up forgotten communities that need investment and these are really communities that need it the most we created opportunities owns we worked with tim scott the great senator from south carolina his idea he came in and saw me i said let\\'s give it a shot you know nothing\\'s worked for the years but this has really worked and now jobs that invest are now pouring into 168 newly designated opportunity zones right here in Arizona alone from pachi to Navajo and Maricopa County\\'s we\\'re supporting working families not my fine paid we are doing it up with paid family leave we\\'re doing something nobody\\'s ever done to this extent reducing the cost of child care and give up 40 million American families an average of 2200 dollars in their pocket thanks to the Republican child tax credit [Applause] our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American Liberty and cutting through job-killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before we ended the war and American energy lowering utility bills reducing prices at the pump and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers for the first time America is now energy independent such beautiful words [Applause] energy-independent we fought wars we did everything we could we used to to the straights and everybody else benefited we\\'d keep them clear so that our countries could take oil from the Middle East with that nobody paid us this other story pay us a lot of money folks they took advantage of us but we have everything we need right now we have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines the Keystone pipeline Keystone XL I approved it the Dakota acted says by mine I approved 48,000 jobs we\\'re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies the worst trade deals any human being has ever seen I\\'d say who who made these deals the worst stupidest deals I\\'ve ever seen they were good for other nations if you like other nations that\\'s great but we\\'re now putting America first is very simple [Applause] for years Washington politicians of money from lobbyists global corporations and really the most corrupt special interests anybody\\'s ever seen to ship our jobs and our factories to other countries we lost our taxes we lost our workers we lost our companies and we did nothing about it now we\\'ve done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA the worst steal ever made worst trade deal ever made one that was almost as bad and gave China and entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the world trade world trade WTO one of the worst deals that we participated in by the way we just won seven and a half billion dollars in a lawsuit with WTO we weren\\'t winning we weren\\'t winning anything but they said I think this guy\\'s going to pull out they treated us so unfairly we were always in the minority position I mean who the hell they go share these deals but they lutely get us so they say look if we\\'re not treated fairly we\\'re gone all of a sudden we\\'re winning all these cases but we took this one seven in a billion seven do you know the dog seven and a half billion but under this administration thrown in your face at a supermarket it was like a thing it just like flew away there was nothing and now it\\'s doing very well but you know what\\'s something we won\\'t be here and when we\\'re not those papers are in big trouble but this thing was a dead newspaper but I was watching and they had a an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they\\'re doing and they have many mike has spent four hundred and eleven million dollars and it\\'s a question mark Cousy could I tell you how he\\'s gonna do it\\'s probably not gonna get the Democratic nomination that\\'s always gonna do but many mike $411 then they had this idiot steyr we call him impeachments tiger how did that work out steyr he\\'s another beauty the guy worked he spent 210 million he got 1/3 of 1% in Iowa and in New Hampshire he did much better he got less than 3% guys in there 550 million how did it work out steyr you jerk I don\\'t even I\\'ve never even heard of it I never even heard of I turn on every time for years I\\'m turning on them Peacham they don\\'t even know why they never say why I don\\'t have any reason impeach the president I spent a fortune on this stuff so it worked out pretty good but anyway so then I go and I look so it has mini-map like sorry push your marks you know I can give the answer right now they have to have question right then they go down and they had other people some of them are like that works for uh who honestly you know it was a tough day for Bush when he joined campaign because Clinton didn\\'t win Ross Perot took a what a 19% of the vote didn\\'t Clinton get 41 or 43 percent so you know give me a break but that\\'s okay whatever but they address prevent like a hundred million which is like probably double if you bring it up to today\\'s dollars and then they have different people if into mine who ran Steve Forbes here Antoine said he went for a lot now this is your own money so this is your own money and I said I\\'d spend a lot of money on my primers we\\'ll see how the hell we do it\\'s amazing once you win money comes in like it comes in pretty fast what\\'s that all about but so in the middle they had Trump and then they had four or five that were behind me a lot of money spent loss loss loss loss loss but in the middle they have Donald Trump and it didn\\'t say 500 million and it didn\\'t say 250 like this tire guy it didn\\'t say it said 70 million of my own money I spent seventy and it said Donald Trump won the presidency of the United States [Applause] you know my father would teach me if you could spend less than wind that\\'s better than spending a lot in winning crooked Hillary spent at least three times before than we did [Applause] crook in his house he\\'s crooked as hell we have a double side of justice it\\'s very unfair what\\'s going on very unfair but let\\'s see how it all works out folks let\\'s see how it all works out I hope you\\'re gonna be happy I hope you\\'re gonna be happy because there are a lot of dishonest slime balls out there dishonest scum dirty cops a lot of dirty cops and by the way the FBI those guys are that are incredible by the ones on top they were absolute scum and what they were trying to do if that happened to Obama or a Democrat or especially a liberal Democrat they\\'d be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already they supplied our campaign remember that and after they spied we won and that after we won they tried to get a side of office they\\'re dissing it\\'s never happened before in the history of our country and we can\\'t let that happen we can never ever excuse it we can never let them get away with that [Applause] never let him get away with it but we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great last month we ended the NASA that look you saw it NAFTA catastrophe and that\\'s what it was we ended that catastrophe and again I really I really ran because of NAFTA I said how stupid all over the place in your state but you go to New England empty factories empty buildings still you have empty buildings we lost so much with our 60,000 factories and plants and I signed that brand new beautiful US Mexico Canada agreement into law and the u.s. MCA is a gigantic victory for farmers and ranchers and manufacturers all across the great state of Arizona and you know by the way for people with the small farms and small businesses if you love your children you can now leave your companies you could leave your farm you can leave your ranch to your children and you don\\'t have to pay they don\\'t pay the facts they don\\'t pet a inheritance tax a big deal that\\'s a big deal so if you love your children is good if you don\\'t love your children it doesn\\'t matter don\\'t leave it to them if you don\\'t love if your children are no good to you don\\'t give them anything let them go how to work like hell now if you love does anybody in this incredible audience then is a big building does anybody not love their children anybody do I have a hand do I have oh there\\'s a head you got a beginning you gotta be kidding so then you don\\'t care about the tax so don\\'t worry about he\\'s just not care about well that\\'s good you look like you know it\\'s got to be stuff you\\'d love to be his kid they also took the strongest ever action to confront China\\'s massive theft of American jobs and our strategy lay out a spot designed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our words protect our intellectual property and boost American exports China will invest two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year into the United States and buy our products and create jobs a thing that has ever happened people after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country that\\'s the way we want we are finally putting our country first we are putting America first or no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than immigration you know it almost better than anybody anybody does you know it better than anybody what they\\'ve done in your border but we\\'re stopping that border that border is clogged and we\\'ve started the big wall right in Arizona we built a lot of wall that\\'s a big one that\\'s that people on top of the line before I came into office the far-left policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country poisoning our children including as you know very well right here in Arizona Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the well-being of American citizens they want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare health care everything they want to give them everything at a time they would treat it and you know this before I came they were treated far better than our veterans were treated now our veterans are treated great through the elimination costs Arizona taxpayers more than two billion dollars a year two billion you pay nearly 20% of Arizona\\'s annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem for the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants we could rebuild our cities all throughout America which is what we should be doing under my administration we are finally taking care of our open citizens including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our lawyers pay their taxes and our entire to a government that protects the families and their community every day Democrats open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives in Arizona on last year ice officers arrested over 4,500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and murder writer in Phoenix an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood then walk over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he lay dying in this had previously been deported after serving six years in prison and you know he was in prison sick years he was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it they want to protect him lastly illegal alien young woman yet left-wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens even convicted criminals and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into America\\'s thankfully Arizona has banned sanctuary cities and with the Republican majority in Congress we will ban them in every state in America and I\\'ll tell you in California I just left town got it off with a speech in Nevada 7:30 in the morning I then went to California to teaches I then went someplace else I said am i finish it no you\\'re gonna go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of 25,000 people and I said that\\'s okay okay I said that\\'s okay now I know that\\'s okay cuz I love is unbelievable energy in this graph but you\\'re not honestly there\\'s tremendous energy in our nation there\\'s tremendous energy greatest nation in the world that\\'s through our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row which will soon be a record illegal crossing are down seventy-five percent since last spring the month of January saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years and we\\'ve ended catch and release a horrible Democrat policy that we got terminated Border Patrol great people have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year and we\\'ve deported record numbers of gang members including the worst gang of all ms-13 thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country and we\\'ve done more to secure the border than any Administration in history we\\'re building the wall as I said faster than ever and will soon be among one new mile a day we\\'re looking for that Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders how\\'s he doing tonight a hundred and thirty-two congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie\\'s health care takeover of the world think of this 180 million Americans are going to lose health care coverage under this plan but if you don\\'t mind I\\'m not gonna criticize it tonight let them keep going and I\\'ll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election okay cuz I don\\'t want him to change please don\\'t change same with the green new deal I don\\'t want to talk about it Doug tonight I don\\'t want to talk about it you know came up with the name Pocahontas too low too early but fortunately she\\'s self-destructed anyway did you ever see a phony like that she\\'s a phony she lost because she couldn\\'t keep it straight on her own heritage she said she was an Indian I said I have more Indian blood in me than you have and I have none she said oh and she panicked she panicked and she had a test you know the result one 124 I think I win the bet somewhere along the line I think I win now she yeah I did it too early I would have saved it but I guess it was effective she\\'s essentially gonzo so one of those things while the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American health care in your Social Security my administration is protecting your Social Security your Medicare and is fighting to give you great health care and that\\'s what we\\'re getting right one of the big secrets the Democrats won\\'t let us say it they want to keep that as quiet as possible look what they gave you the worst health care and what we\\'ve done we\\'ve gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you everybody was happy we\\'re defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice we\\'re making health care better and much much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were and it\\'s better health care a lot of people don\\'t know this people don\\'t know this they think that\\'s their issue it\\'s not they failed on health care we\\'re protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will and by the way we\\'re trying to get rid of Obamacare but we\\'re managing it incredibly but we\\'re trying to get rid so we can give you a great health care plan and protect pre-existing conditions remember though we\\'re trying to get rid of it but while we haven\\'t we\\'re managing it really much better than they did remember they built the five billion dollar website remember that was supposed to cost five million dollars it costs five billion dollars five billion I mean you could get a kid out of high school I have a son he\\'s a young boy thirteen he uses a computer he could have given them a healthcare site I would say he would have charged him a hundred dollars Baron truck and it would have worked he\\'s so good hi dad how you doing dad how\\'s it gonna being being Bogg I said don\\'t play with that while you\\'re talking to me well what\\'s going on dad these kids you know are incredible all right the kids they make us look like babies with that but he could have given you a great sight for about two dollars they spent five billion dollars on a site that never worked I by the way speaking of that how did they do with their vote count in Iowa and I hear I hear I don\\'t want to say it I don\\'t want to jinx them because of course I want them to do well but I do you know we don\\'t have anything nobody\\'s running against us in so many states it\\'s sort of nice we can save the Thunder right but you know I hear that in Nevada I\\'m hearing bad things about their vote count I hear a lot of bad things are happening like they don\\'t know what the hell they\\'re doing you know I turned on the other night Iowa I wanted to see and by the way we set a record in the history of Iowa we had more votes and anybody\\'s ever had as an incumbent president same thing in New Hampshire good sign to the Sun by a lot by the way by a lot but I\\'m hearing that and I hope this isn\\'t the case because you know I\\'d like to find out who to help one we still don\\'t know who won in Iowa I heard coming over here they\\'re still working on the count no no though he said you won yeah I think we did that\\'s very good I\\'ll have to think of that one that\\'s very good now we did well look we are winning we\\'re winning big we have fake polls out there these guys do fake polls they\\'re fake polls 20:16 I\\'d hear these pulse I\\'d hear women didn\\'t like and I did great with women I everyone didn\\'t like me nobody like nobody like me and then one thank you whether nobody liked me 2016 no no I hear that you know remember women didn\\'t like and then at the end he did great with women he did great with this he did great with everybody we did great with everybody remember 306 to 223 that\\'s a slaughter that\\'s the story remember they said he cannot get they used the word path there is no path right to 270 I was at 269 if I did great but they said there\\'s no chance but I was at 269 so I went to Maine Isle of Man I went to Maine Maine\\'s cut in half and one Maine has one I went there four or five times people are great I wanted and they were right there is no path to 270 but there was a path to 306 [Applause] there is no path that\\'s right dog they said there is no path the fake news media there is no path for Donald Trump and then they said the evening of the election it\\'s gonna be a really short night for Donald Trump thank God we got rid of this guy because they did the exit polls going out right and I was even told but a lot of people didn\\'t want to talk about it the highest number in history of people that said Reid s not gonna turn up I can use that name cuz they\\'ll kill me if I use it so I won\\'t use it it\\'s a much better story if I use it because that\\'s the truth that\\'s what how did you vote usually they say I voted for Clinton or voted for Trump right how\\'d you vote none of your business see I\\'m being nice right I\\'ll keep it that way because otherwise we\\'ll ruin the whole leave it is his language is right even this tough guy in the front says I agree how did you vote I don\\'t want to tell you how do you vote not any damn business I\\'m not gonna tell you how do you vote I\\'m not and it was like this massive massive so everybody they just in count that so they say the birds are looking unbelievably well for crooked Hillary Clinton they\\'re looking unbelievable there\\'s going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump we finally will be rid of this guy and then the numbers started coming in [Applause] the numbers are started on the knee and it started with the great state of Florida Donald Trump has won the state of Florida and then that beautiful convention said of the most beautiful stage I\\'ve ever seen and they knew something was going on because they didn\\'t pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before right fact I went to the fireworks company and I said I\\'ll give you five cents on the dollar for fire water even though there were no idea where my area was we were at a hotel in midtown we like the location better than where she chose but they built the most remember that beautiful stage it was shaped like the United States of America and by the end that didn\\'t look too good did you ever see more unhappy people right so they go Donald Trump is one the great state of Florida they go whoa whoa you know the outspent me like five to one only negative ads you know they were all negative so by the time people got into the voters both they only knew one thing she hated Donald Trump but they said what the hell does she stand for what did she do every ad was a negative and so it tells you negative ads at least against me aren\\'t so good they can\\'t be effective but I think they spent like two billion dollars on negative ads everything was negative so nobody knew what the hell she spent you know her husband said she was gonna lose her husband\\'s a professional her husband said you know you better go to Michigan because I was there and they had a Trump pen sign on every law and I\\'ve ever seen I\\'ve never seen and you better go to Wisconsin Hillary you better go to Wisconsin she said no we haven\\'t lost Wisconsin in 36 years no no Hillary you gotta go there I\\'m telling you I don\\'t like what I said Oh what do you know you know he\\'s a professional politician she wasn\\'t it\\'s one of those little problems in life so then it came in and then we won South Carolina we won North Carolina right and we were leading Pennsylvania by so much that if I lost you remember two percent of the vote left if I lost every single vote I win by a lot they refused the fake news refused to call it I kept saying we won Pennsylvania why don\\'t they call it it was very late in the evening when they caught because they\\'re fake crooked they\\'re fake and I said I said I said why don\\'t they call Pennsylvania but some beautiful things happened and by the way Ohio we won by one of the largest margins ever the great great great state of remember they used to say a year before the election they said well nobody can win nobody unless you win the great state of Ohio and we won the great state of Ohio and we wanted bigger we knew we were going to win it and now we\\'re up a lot more than we were up even then because you know why we\\'re bringing back jobs were bringing back factories everybody\\'s working nobody\\'s ever had a better year than we\\'ve been having and we\\'ve been doing it for a long time right almost from the beginning and don\\'t let them try and take credit because if they came in we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse the d-word depression we would have been because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on and I\\'ll tell you maybe bigger than even the tax cuts and I did it sooner were the regulation cuts we freed up our nation to go back to work so then we won Wisconsin and then we won Michigan because those companies and now they\\'re pouring back in the auto companies are pouring back in and Wisconsin\\'s doing great with the farmers and Canada was taken you know Canada was charging our farmers two hundred and eighty seven percent tariffs for dairy products okay so what happens is this we\\'re working on health care we\\'re fighting to stop surprise medical building I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very fast we\\'ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as the brand drugs but they cost a tiny fraction we\\'ve totally transformed veterans health care including getting long sought VA choice and VA accountability which they said could not be done and we passed this spectacular right to try so if you\\'re in trouble and I hope nobody in this mass of arenas in trouble but if you\\'re in trouble you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever there were we the best doctors best Ostrom best labs you get it and the luck we are having we are saving so many lives it\\'s incredible what\\'s happening people would go to Europe they\\'d go to Asia if they had no money they\\'d go home and die now they have the right to use our drugs before they\\'re approved think of that before they\\'re approved and we\\'re very importantly combating the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths the overdose deaths have declined for the first time in thirty four years and life expectancy is rising again in our nation we\\'ve launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer\\'s disease we\\'re making tremendous progress and we\\'re pursuing new advances in neonatal research think of that do NATO research the numbers are incredible what\\'s happened is incredible to care for America\\'s youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so all of the Radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the very moment of birth that is why in my State of the Union I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God [Applause] the Democrat Party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total destruction of your Second Amendment the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American dream the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln right [Applause] Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every walk of life we are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm we have tremendous energy tremendous energy everybody says to me where do you get the energy because I love what we\\'re doing I see the results and they\\'re happening faster than even think you see the numbers they\\'re happening faster than you would even think we are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement we are the big tent we are the big party we are the party with big ideas for the future [Applause] Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school to keep our America right right to keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life this has been nothing like this I passed criminal justice reform not the Democrats I did it with the Republicans and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the Republican Party the Democrats did not do it they could never have done it to uphold the rule of law we have confirmed 218 federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written and this is a record and as you know I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme Court justices Neal Dorset\\'s and Brett Kavanaugh we have invested 2.2 trillion dollars to rebuild the United States military including nearly two hundred million dollars for Marine Corps Air Station Yuma I recognized Israel as the true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem we recognize Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights they\\'ve been trying to get it for 52 years and for years you watched as your politicians apologize for America you saw that they apologize now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Arizona [Applause] at

prosperity of any country we are doing better than any country in the world that is not even close and we\\'ve rebuilt our military over the last three years don\\'t tell anybody but we spent two and a half trillion dollars but when it comes to our military and our safety and our security we don\\'t worry about budgets right we don\\'t worry about we had a rebuild and it was depleted it was in bad shape it was old it was tired we have the best people in the world but that old equipment that we have brand new jets we have brand new missiles and rockets we have everything all made in the USA in my State of the Union address I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback that\\'s what we\\'re doing our country is stronger today than ever before after three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat Crusades the radical left attempt to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally failed they have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we\\'ve ever had today just came and I don\\'t know if anybody watched last night\\'s debate it got very big ratings and you know what mini mic didn\\'t do well lesson I was gonna send him a note saying it\\'s not easy doing what I do is it it\\'s not easy Mike not easy for any of them now Mike didn\\'t do too well he went way down it\\'s alright mini Mike how about Klobuchar did you see her she choked she choked she\\'s young she couldn\\'t breathe Alfred he Newman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said are you accusing me of being dumb who would make his save it like that because that\\'s really what he was doing but he doesn\\'t want to say that no no how about that are you saying I\\'m dumb that was the end of her campaign in my book together you don\\'t say that even if it\\'s true you don\\'t say that you know they had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows I tell you Fox doesn\\'t treat us the way they used to but we have the great Sean Hannity we do now we have more and Tucker and we have in the morning Fox and friend Steve and Angel and Brian\\'s gotten much better he\\'s moving up and we have the great Lou Dobbs Lou Dobbs says he\\'s the greatest president ever the great Lou Dobbs he said Lou Dobbs is a year and a half two years ago he said he\\'s the greatest since Reagan then he said about six months ago he\\'s better than Reagan and then he said a few nights ago he\\'s the greatest we\\'ve ever had I said I said does that include Lincoln and George Washington he said that includes them all that\\'s Lou Dobbs then you\\'ve got hagseth and you\\'ve got Jesse waters how about Jesse and judge Jeanine that even Greg got for dinner break Greg hated us right but now he\\'s just look whether I like him or not he gets it done it\\'s all about getting it done I will getting it done nobody\\'s ever done what we\\'ve done now but Fox says that I don\\'t know it\\'s different it was different in the old days it was better for us it was better for us but it\\'s okay we\\'ll win anyway well whatever no but they had this woman on Neil Cavuto doesn\\'t treat us good Neil Cavuto he\\'s not too good she said I don\\'t like him nobody likes him he\\'s right now so you had you know remember last in the readies you remember who was last in the ratings he got fired right you remember right you remember he\\'s gone and now Neil\\'s take your displace Neil\\'s actually a nice kept but you know he doesn\\'t like Trump too much and he put this woman on today and she said Donald Trump didn\\'t do well in the debates and he won because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg sometimes referred to as mini Mike and I said wait a minute I want every debate it\\'s show and we sit then polls poll after poll after poll not only won them but one of my lot I want every debate I\\'m not saying I\\'m just saying every poll you know they do those polls right after three for 500,000 people Time magazine I said nobody\\'s allowed to do that you can\\'t do that we\\'re at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news you know they make up [Applause] so where is dance cabina where scavino does anyone know dance communal is Dan bring me those pages up here bring those pages up see if you can get them go get them just it\\'s such pink news it\\'s so disgusting you know what they do better if they told the truth do you agree they do better ah someday in 10 14 18 22 years when I\\'m gone when we leave office in 26 years or so they\\'re gonna miss us you know I told the story that a month before I ran 2016 I was thinking about it I said to my wife who\\'s become a great first lady you know they said it\\'s one of the greatest fields ever assembled and I said what the hell should I run for if they are so great but I remember holding up the New York Times said it was like a leaflet that you had give it a certain like a supermarket right it\\'s like you know the thing was blowing and they had no way was dead and now it\\'s successful again but when we leave it\\'s all of us we leave to get there were unified this is the most unified the Republican Party has ever been and when we leave the New York Times thank you the great day is giving the most powerful man in politics hey Dan so Zuckerberg left who is number one in the world on Facebook and I\\'m saying this in front of the fake news because if I\\'m wrong they\\'re gonna report me right who is number one in the world or in Facebook he walked in but that\\'s us he walked in for we had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes I want to find out what\\'s going on but he walked any smart and he said I just want to congratulate you small dinner a few people he said you\\'re number one in the world in Facebook I said I said who\\'s number two he said Prime Minister Modi of India I said wait a minute women he\\'s got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one but we\\'re never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country for Facebook for Twitter for anything and they still haven\\'t figured it out they have not figured it out but look at all that press look at all that press by the way how bad were the Academy Awards this year you see [Applause] and the winner is a movie from South Korea what the hell was that all about we got enough problems with South Korea with trade on top of it they give him the best movie of the year was it good I don\\'t know you know I\\'m looking for like we\\'re way let\\'s get down with the wind can we get like Gone with the Wind back please Sunset Boulevard so many great movies the winner is from South Korea I thought it was best foreign film there\\'s far a movie know who is the button did this ever happened before and then you have Brad Pitt I was never a big fan of his he got upset a little wiseguys little wiseguy he\\'s a little wife\\'s guy anyway but we\\'re doing what but here just showed this real quick right so this horrible journalist she\\'s a real you know I choose a trumpeter she gets you know she\\'s worth zero ratings nobody watches her but she said she was struggling Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night he jump he\\'s another one who\\'s going AHA oh oh I can\\'t breathe I can\\'t breathe don\\'t ask me the question please I look at my wife I said let\\'s send him a little note it\\'s not so easy up there to do what I did right not so easy but there\\'s woman who\\'s a third-rate fourth-rate she\\'s been with everybody every year she\\'s like with a different group but I won\\'t use her name cuz we\\'ll make it too famous it actually plays to their advantage but she\\'s third-rate and she\\'s on the lowest rated show on Fox Neil Cavuto so he like that\\'s why so she said Donald Trump didn\\'t get good ratings he didn\\'t do well in the polls he said he didn\\'t do well on the debates she said that we were defeated in the debates why he defeated crooked Hillary every time so yeah she\\'s crooked as a $3 bill you know I was going whatever happened in the 33,000 emails whatever happened 33,000 she deleted them and ran support stuff and she didn\\'t get in trouble can you imagine if a Republican did that they would want to bring back the death penalty right to standards but I think things are happening I think you know I said draining the swamp I just never knew how deep it was we have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe and this is part of the swamp so what happens she said Donald Trump didn\\'t do well in the debates now you know remember my answer Rosie O\\'Donnell right first question I\\'ve ever and we took down the house then the second Brett Perry asked me I had to raise the hand I\\'m the only one I guess that raised the hand right and the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth okay turned out I was the only one telling and you know the people get it but she said I didn\\'t do well in the base I said really I won every single debate we had 15 or 14 debates that we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself so here\\'s one I don\\'t want it you know I guilty because these are all my friends right a lot of them are my friends now they weren\\'t my friends then they weren\\'t my mortal enemy hard to be friends when you\\'re competing against somebody right you\\'re right about that so here\\'s Donald Trump 67 the next one was 13% the next one was 5 percent 4 percent 3 percent 2% 2% 2% 1% 1% and 0 all right that\\'s Time magazine all right that\\'s time they don\\'t like me I don\\'t like them either by the way although actually I do like to do older this year I got beaten out by Greta you know Greta last year I got beat down I feel I want it but when the world evolves around to all of us we should be chosen there\\'s nothing wrong with it I mean we\\'ve won it but we should win it every single year let\\'s face it and now they call it Person of the Year they don\\'t go it man of the year and I know the Trump and Ted Cruz I can say he came in second you know he was a great debater and Marco came in third and a guy who I don\\'t like much and they don\\'t like a much in Ohio either Kasich Kasich he was way down way down okay look who won Trump [Music] here\\'s another one look again a different one Time magazine Trump 33% ben Carson good man he was down Marco Jeb Ted Carly Fiorina name I haven\\'t heard in a long time what happened to Carly and ran good Paul here\\'s the sir look but way up way up here is another one Trump 46% I didn\\'t make this up here\\'s another one this is a different debate I don\\'t know they\\'re all different I want every one of them look Trump I just took these at random 46% second 5 percent 3 percent 5 percent 3 percent 9 percent 5 percent 11 percent Trump 46% is it other one CNBC well you know the markets been up they\\'ve actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy he is a good guy some of the rest of don\\'t care for it too much Becky\\'s life she plays it a little bit down the middle right which is okay drop almost 50% then they have all the rest of them 14 four three two two point eight two point five four one point nine I\\'m not gonna give you the names I won\\'t tell you that I got forty eight point eight and Jeb Bush Jeb Bush got one point one the rest I\\'m not going to talk about but he hasn\\'t been exactly a great supporter you know sort of had never Trump her I guess so Jeb 1.9 1.1 and trunk 48 that\\'s another one oh here\\'s a nice one here\\'s a nice one look at this look at this Trump 70% next one is 18% next one is 7 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 Trump didn\\'t do well in the debates see their fake news [Applause] here\\'s another one Trump kicked ass Trump kicked ass Trump 48 number two over six here\\'s another one Trump seventy five point six truck at Hillary is 24% this was against crooked Hillary so look at that Trump was seventy four point six crooked Hillary Clinton was twenty four point one Trump was eighty percent crooked Hillary was eighteen percent and I\\'ve got this woman you know who it is right you know yet nobody knows that they were not gonna Richard but everybody knows Neil Cavuto she has no credibility and neither do you Neil Cavuto here\\'s another one crooked Hillary and by the way one is a Fox ball one is Breitbart one is a Drudge Report one is the patch one is Syracuse comm one is palette opinion oh it\\'s a good one but look at these numbers drop 92 what is it start winning every poll I\\'d beat crooked Hillary here\\'s the one Trump 61 crooked Hillary 39 okay that\\'s what it is and then I turn on the damn show and Fox again it\\'s not the same it was much better it really was it was much better I turned on Fox and I\\'ve got this third great political journalist if you call her that saying Trump did very poorly in the debates but he became Fred no I did great in the debates I became president because of the debates because unlike many Mike I could answer questions and here\\'s a final one and I could get you another 15 these are all the ones they\\'re taken right after people call in hundreds of thousands of people they call in Time magazine CNBC so here\\'s the CNBC crooked Hillary Clinton 39% Donald Trump 61% and then this stupid person said I didn\\'t debate well now look you know I don\\'t mind and you can have bad debates but I want every single debate and then I then I listen to this then three and a half four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn\\'t do well because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world take it take it okay let\\'s get back to business now I feel good now I feel she\\'s a third-rate journalist let\\'s go we\\'re standing up in defense of our Constitution our freedom and democracy itself right while the extreme left has been wasting America\\'s time and doing all sorts of vile hoaxes we went through hoaxes we went through the impeachment scam and by the way Corrie was with us all the way he didn\\'t move he didn\\'t budge he said it\\'s a lot of bull he said it\\'s a lot of bull but while they\\'re doing that stuff and you know we\\'re working with a cloud we\\'re working with these people they want to take you out they want to change the results they got caught spying let\\'s say it like it is right they got caught spying on our election fake news hey fake news take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind ciao in the room you see they never do it including Fox by the way Fox is not that much better we just got lucky because we have some all the high rated shows are the shows that like Trump all their loser shows like Cavuto are the shows that don\\'t like Trump how is Shep Smith doing lately by the way how\\'s chef Lee he had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that\\'s okay but they never show the room my wife our great first lady she goes I say I say hi honey did you watch the debate yeah how did the room look was that because last night we I think we turned away 21,000 people we had an arena that it held like 12 but we fill up the basketball courts right oh the ice rink we had to have 15 16 thousand people it was like on fire you all saw her it was red and she said to me she said darling how did you do I said I did great I said did you see the arena she said no they never show the arena [Applause] you know that guy Dana White at UFC well you know I won\\'t tell you about him yet but he\\'s a brilliant guy right I mean he sold his crazy fighters I mean bom-bom-bom four billion dollars he got with for Tina\\'s great people but you know what they\\'re always showing it\\'s full it\\'s full these fakers back there they don\\'t want people but I\\'ll tell you what my wife said they don\\'t show it but you can\\'t imitate fifteen thousand people when it comes to the noise look they won\\'t show they never show and we\\'ve never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator not one and what these guys do now what these guys do if mister mrs. Jones sitting right up there beautiful couple if she said darling I\\'m sorry there\\'s nothing I can do about it darling I have to go to the bathroom he said darling I\\'ll walk with you the cameras glom onto those seats they flung on and they say they were two empty seats didn\\'t fill up the room these are the worst people but when I told them to spin around those cameras they stayed that way now if we had a protester somewhere in the arena it could be up in that corner where it\\'s loaded up with people those cameras they can do they look like a pretzel they look like a pretzel they want to find in this trouble those same guys can it could cover anything I used to think well it\\'s the equipment it\\'s very rigid they can\\'t turn it and then some idiot from up in the corner start screaming super self of course that\\'s dangerous in this room to be honest we don\\'t have it too huh they only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren\\'t fighters but if somebody up there does something those cameras turn around spin around like a pretzel they been boned again so that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment no and by the way I told them turn around not one of those cameras turned around to show them because it\\'s fake news while the extreme left has been wasting America\\'s time with vile hoaxes we\\'ve been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages enacting fair trade deal securing our border at lifting up citizens of every race color religion and free right we added another 225,000 brand-new beautiful jobs last month way way way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be 225,000 think of it we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country almost 160 million people and right now since the election we go by the election don\\'t forget a lot of things happened when we won from the day we won that beautiful November day the most exciting night in the history of television including UFC fights including a season the most exciting night the biggest ratings in the history of television worldwide they were watching our side friends in Paris in London what are you doing I\\'m watching you know three in the morning two in the morning five in the morning they\\'re watching the whole world was watching that was the most exciting television that anybody\\'s ever seen even ESPN some guy on ESPN said this is the most exciting event I\\'ve ever seen and all he does is watch sporting events in big ones but since the election since the election seven million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we\\'ve invested more than two trillion dollars into that military that we talked about and we created something that\\'s very exciting and we have our great new general he\\'s on the he\\'s on our I\\'ll tell ya he was on a list of that most incredible men you\\'ve ever seen the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces the space force and I will be making a big decision for the space force as to where it\\'s going to be located and I know you want we\\'ll be making that decision toward the end of the year you know I was here I did I did your I met I was up at the Air Force Academy and I did I greeted those kids they were so great I did the commencement address was anybody that I did the commencement and the general said sir would you like to shake hands with the cadets I said does everyone else do it president oh yes sir what he didn\\'t say is they\\'ll shake ten hands I said so they do how many do you have sir we have eleven hundred and fifty-six killeth I say you mean other people do it yes sir but they don\\'t do 1156 they\\'ll do thirty forty they\\'ll take the top ten out of the class I said I\\'ll do it I stood there for two and a half hours and the Sun was blazing true and I shook 1156 hands and you know a lot of these kids are very strong physically in fact you have one of them as an example he was the winner of the home run derby did you know that college think of that the college home run derby I said let me see you I want to see what you look like he stands up uniform everything else and by the way it did something for Air Force but I did something for all of the academies if you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting although they\\'ve done well if you\\'re a great athlete you can\\'t you know we wanted to sort of get him to go but they didn\\'t because they didn\\'t want to serve five years in the military and then they go into the NFL or baseball so I had one of the teams and they said sure give us the waiver sir they\\'ve been after the waiver you know what the waiver is that means that if you are a great athlete you could go to the Air Force Academy or army Navy the Coast Guard you could you can go to one of our service academies I did the rule and we got it through Congress and you don\\'t have to surf you go directly into the major leagues into the NFL and you serve your time after when you get out isn\\'t that correct and the army coach is a great guy all great guys Navy coach the army cons said sir if you do that we can compete with anybody because we lost a lot of great athletes who said you know we just can\\'t do that now they serve their time afterwards isn\\'t that great now we did it they\\'ve been trying to get that for so many years but I love that I love that group of people I saw this guy from the Home Run Derby and I shook hands wash up hands and they come up and they\\'re strong people and they\\'re shaking their licks I did you know they\\'re little nervous maybe they\\'re meeting the president they\\'re a little nervous and it\\'s strong they got big strong hands in this thing and I\\'m saying you know hello what are you doing captain up my wrestling team sir I admire you greatly sir thank you SEC and I\\'m trying to act like it doesn\\'t hurt by the end of the day I\\'m gonna but we did it and then I said I said I said wait a minute I said general no other president could do that the presidents don\\'t do that he said no they do sir but they stopped usually at around 50 oh that\\'s great but I love the Air Force Academy and you have all of the infrastructure so you\\'re being very strongly considered for the space [Music] whereas one and actually I have to say this I think I can say this mr. senator but the governor showed up at the plane today your governor Democrat no but in all fairness he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it that\\'s okay it\\'s alright and we are going to be making that decision Cory when we make that decision all right okay but we\\'ve destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100% we killed the founder and leader of Isis al Baghdadi he\\'s dead he\\'s dead and we just killed the world\\'s number one terrorist Kasim Salim and ending his evil reign of terror forever forever and ever [Applause] he was the king of the roadside bomb right you know when you see these young men and in some cases women no legs no arms they get it and 92% of them were from salim haini and then they started making them they had great detection we had these guys great detection then all of a sudden the detection wasn\\'t working because they started making a mat of plastic instead of metal so they\\'re blowing the guys up with the with the scopes so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making another plastic real scum but he\\'s gone he\\'s evil he\\'s dead and America is respected again like never before [Music] but as we keep on winning Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds they\\'ve gone nuts that\\'s why millions of registered Democrats voters people that were with the Democrats for a long time they\\'re leaving their party to join our movement they\\'re joining our great Republican Party we have more enthusiasm than any parties had in the last 50 years and don\\'t believe stories and don\\'t believe polls because the polls are worse than the stories they give phony Paul\\'s I got a call two weeks ago the great state of Texas they love me and I love them remember bado remember I was born for this I was bored I said any guy that says that I got problems well he had problem so he\\'s from Texas he had a little problem he came out against oil I guess the Bible and guns Abraham Lincoln couldn\\'t win Texas if you\\'re against think of it so he\\'s against religion he\\'s against guns and he\\'s against oil somehow that doesn\\'t play but they had listened to this one because this happened four years ago you remember Donald Trump is in trouble in Texas I don\\'t think so I don\\'t think and then they announced tonight right eight o\\'clock the polls have closed and you know they only announced very if you\\'re really gonna win by a lot otherwise it takes all night the polls have closed in the great state of Texas Donald Trump is one the great state of Texas but they had Alfred E Newman Buddha touch little Buddha touch I said I\\'ve had you up to here they had little Buddha touch leading Donald Trump in Texas these people but very close he said it\\'s too close to

lot of what we\\'ve done and we\\'re gonna go over to the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we\\'ve done for the vets with choice and accountability but you know what they can undo it but in four years they can\\'t undo it because that tree will be planted it\\'ll be solid they\\'re not going to be able to go so we got away and your Second Amendment is that stake remember that so this November

thing that happened in 2016 it was the normalization of socialism by Bernie Sanders the most dangerous thing was the normalization of socialism by Bernie Sanders because what happened candidates started running as socialists they embraced the platform and today there are shades of socialism they are running to the left on a socialist platform they want to take our guns they want to take our health care that\\'s their platform what they say they will do Colorado where you can let it happen we will not mr. president you\\'ve done so much good for Colorado as a result of your work the

created nearly 180,000 new jobs right here in Colorado nobody would have thought that including including 25,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs remember they said you can\\'t do manufacturing jobs anymore really tell me about it unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over one half a century the average unemployment rate this is a beauty for my administration is the lowest for any United States president in the history of our country the unemployment rate among african-americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded and for women 71 years and soon you\\'re gonna be hitting the historic number 71 years the best numbers in 71 years african-american and Hispanic American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded the unemployment rate for women is going and I\\'m telling you within a very short period of time you\\'re gonna see some statistics coming out on when statistics I got to do it right otherwise they\\'ll say what\\'s wrong you know if you go 16 of these and if you mispronounce one word they say what\\'s wrong statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable they\\'re going to be unbelievable the best several the veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in US history half a million more hispanic americans now own a home we\\'ve lifted 10 million people off of welfare and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country think of efforts to lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with tim scott great guy great senator from south carolina Opportunity Zones jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Colorado you know about that but amazing opportunity zones are amazing what\\'s happened we\\'re supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it reducing the cost of child care and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit people don\\'t know that our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats we repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule which was basically taking away your property and we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington DC we just on it and thank you very much secretary Barnard just up here nice slim beautiful looking man he looks beautiful when you work with him he\\'s beautiful because he gets it done and you\\'re moving it and its headquarters to Grand Junction Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American West should live right here in the great American West and we have ended the war on American energy there was a war and we\\'re up here and we\\'re doing it we are right now energy independent can you believe they want to use wind wind wind blow wind please Lisa please please keep the birds away from those windmills please tell those beautiful bald eagles no a bald eagle you know if you shoot a bald eagle they put you in jail for a long time but the windmills knock them out like crazy it\\'s true and I think they have a role after a certain number of killed you have to close down the windmill until the following you do you believe this and they\\'re all made in China and in Germany Siemens and for those of you that want to hear it when they\\'re making them more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone the atmosphere more stuff is going up there they\\'re making it a and they don\\'t say this but you know after a period of time they get tired they get old they get rusty and a lot of the guys say hey their useful life is gone let\\'s get the hell out of here and they\\'re all over the place you look at Palm Springs California take a look Palm Springs they\\'re all over the place they\\'re closed they\\'re rotting they look like hell every major Democrat running for president wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas crushing Colorado\\'s economy destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state they\\'re doing that look you\\'re gonna vote for one of these people probably crazy Bernie he seems to be leading mini mic I thought he might come up but he can\\'t because he can\\'t debate he wasn\\'t meant for the camera do we agree he wasn\\'t exactly great last night now I think you lost to last night only in Colorado could somebody say now you\\'re gonna probably it looks like Bernie does that looks like crazy Bernie crazy Bernie\\'s not big into natural gas and oil and the things that keep our great factories and plants going right but Colorado voters will never let it happen we\\'re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies America lost 1 & 4 manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the WTO but under this administration all of that is changing the era of economic surrender is over thank you last month we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand-new US Mexico Canada agreement into law credible deal the u.s. MCA is a gigantic victory for farmers ranchers and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state also you know something we got that people don\\'t talk about if you love your children you don\\'t have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses if you love your children is good and if you don\\'t love your children don\\'t worry about it doesn\\'t matter who the hell knows you don\\'t love them don\\'t leave don\\'t leave that beautiful farm to your children give it to somebody else okay they don\\'t treat you well don\\'t leave a damn thing are you listening Donny are you listening Donny I also took now it is true that\\'s a big deal you know farmers were leaving their ranch in their farms and their people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed and valued much higher in many cases that it was worth you couldn\\'t do it they go out your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money that end up losing their business losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years you know what happens and they\\'re good kids and maybe they\\'ll never be you they can\\'t farm like you and maybe they can\\'t and maybe they can maybe they\\'re better but you know what they go out and they\\'d borrow a lot of money and they\\'d lose the farms the numbers staggering we got rid of it no more death tax no more inheritance and I also took the strongest ever action to confront China\\'s massive theft of American jobs what they\\'ve done to us over the years we\\'re losing two hundred billion three hundred four hundred five hundred not not million billion billion not million you know five hundred million would be a lot right we\\'re talking about five hundred billion they were taking it our strategy worked we put tariffs up 25 percent of the first two hundred and fifty billion billions of dollars poured into the United States they devalued their currency and they pumped money in we didn\\'t pay for it despite the fact that these guys they like to say they did we didn\\'t pay for it and I\\'ll tell you what China came to the table and we made a deal that\\'s great for us and hopefully it\\'s great for them and last month as you know we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property and boost American exports two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of purchases fifty billion dollars worth of farm agricultural purchase fifty billion you know the most they ever purchased was 16 billion right you know that story I\\'ve told it a couple of times 16 billion was the most ever you know secretary sonny perdue agriculture has done a great job i said who\\'s the worst what\\'s the biggest year 16 billion soon i said all right make it 20 so they agreed on 20 so now we\\'re getting ready to close the deal biggest trade deal ever made just never but biggest deal ever made we\\'re getting ready to close the view between that and us mca right we\\'re getting ready to close that i go over and say what do you have done for the farmers David great although I have been helping yell I gave you a lot of money I gave you a lot of money 16 billion one year twelve billion from the year before I took it out of the tariff so we had a lot left over but think of it but I said so tell me fellas let me ask you what do we have what\\'s the number 20 billion sir they\\'re gonna purchase 20 billion worth of farm products I said make it 50 tell them make of it so we went to China and they were great you know they got 1.5 billion people right got a lot of feeding to do and I said do me a favor instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers would you make it 50 no no no no no and they agreed to do it they agree to I don\\'t think you\\'re gonna be able to make it you better be able to make it I don\\'t want the farmers coming to me sir sir I\\'m sorry we can\\'t produce that much sir I said our farmers will find a way they\\'ll go out and buy larger tractors and buy some extra land right go out of buy a bigger tractor or something no but it is true I\\'ve had people say sir they can\\'t produce that much I said forget it they will look at him you\\'re a farmer they\\'ll do they\\'ll figure that one out although Mike Bloomberg says you\\'ll never figure it out right there they don\\'t figure that long before him you\\'ll figure that one out long before him now I know the farmers I\\'m not worried fifty billion dollars or nois you have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration right every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives in this region alone last year ice officers arrested over two thousand and by the way our ice officers these guys are tough and they\\'re going over 2,000 criminal aliens that\\'s ms-13 gangs thousands and they bring them back to where they came from and by the way now their countries take her back they weren\\'t taken aback safe third agreements right they take them back charge you\\'re convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and murder we bring them back and in some cases we don\\'t even want to bring them back we have to put them I don\\'t want to house them for the next 50 years but you know what we don\\'t want to take chances either but we\\'ll bring them back to Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Mexico we bring them back they didn\\'t used to take em they say we don\\'t want to back oh okay we\\'ll keep him ourselves we don\\'t do that anymore in dead burn an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing the judge multiple times attempting to murder him in his own home the alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years other than that other than that he was a very fine fellow for crimes including assault and child abuse yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country in communities across the nation radical and we\\'re watching them very closely left-wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities and sanctuary states and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities last year Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminal and as a result of state and local sanctuary policies officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community in Denver officials released a criminal alley and arrested on felony drug charges and now he is a very dangerous man we just caught him for attempted murder and right here in Colorado Springs El Paso County officials defied the request of federal law enforcement and released a criminal Ellyn arrested for robbery assault and kidnapping they released him straight into your community these are the Democrats these are your Democrats Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murders predators kidnappers and felons in our country and that come in illegally Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not criminal if you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states if you want to protect your family and your loved ones you must vote for quarry vote for Trump vote for the Republican Party we\\'re getting it done [Applause] thank you very much and thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we\\'ve reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row illegal crossings are down 75 percent since last spring and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release you know what you do you catch them you say what do you live they don\\'t live for you never have an address will you live give us your address we don\\'t have an address many are criminals many are very dangerous criminals so they\\'re saying and we are building the wall has gone up 122 miles as of yesterday and it\\'s a serious flaw you know did you hear two weeks ago a small section like twice the size of this stage we were putting it up and they\\'re pouring the concrete and you know it\\'s like a lot of it since Mexico it\\'s a very rough territory some of it it\\'s partially desert we were in a rough area very windy and we had a tremendous sand and windstorm so we hadn\\'t put it in we put it in and it was just getting set and we got hit with like a tornado of wind and it blew it down and the fake News said Trump\\'s wall fell down it was blown but see at least we have a voice where we can explain it\\'s true and we lifted it up and we held it up and when the storm went by we had it set and it set beautifully in the following day that suckers gonna be up for many many years can you imagine I said what happened in a certain area and we\\'re doing a great job by the way in New Mexico New Mexico is going to be a great great state for the Republican border and Arizona what we\\'re doing on the border in Arizona and they want us to do it badly but can you imagine that the thing falls over because the concrete was just poured soaking wet and it falls over and they make it sound like the wall fell down these are very very dishonest people but you know that Border Patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded it\\'s horrible what\\'s happening the largest amount ever recorded we\\'ve deported record numbers of gang members especially the ms-13 gang members but there are others that are just as though and we\\'ve done more to secure the border than any Administration in the history of our country the border is going to be very soon secured we\\'ll have some time next year over 500 miles of beautiful powerful wall bill Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie\\'s health care takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want while the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American health care and try to destroy your Social Security that won\\'t happen with me my administration is protecting your Social Security your Medicare and is fighting to give you great great health care already done a good job we\\'re defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice remember President Obama 28 times he said keep your doctor keep your plan keep your doctor keep your plan keep your doctor keep your plan right it was a lie we should impeach him we shouldn\\'t be telling impeach obama get him out of office now nobody thought of that we caught him in a lie 28 times at least he\\'s on record we caught him in a lie but nobody said let\\'s impeach him only these maniacs crazy Nancy Pelosi Bryan Junction what about little pencil neck right pencil day he\\'s got the world\\'s smallest neck is a guy that lied about my stamp and he made up a statement he he delivered it before a contract he made up a statement it was totally fiction he made it up and then they tell me you know you\\'re getting ready to sue him and they say oh no he\\'s protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress that should be worse you know that should be worse little wise guy we\\'re making health care better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office we\\'re now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they\\'re better they\\'re better we\\'re protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will we\\'re fighting to stop surprise medical building I signed an executive order imposing price transparency that\\'s going to be bigger than health care in a certain way watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very very fast we have approved a record number of affordable new generic drops which are just as good as the name-brand drugs but at a tiny fraction of the cost we have totally transformed veteran\\'s health care including getting the long-sought VA choice and VA accountability so now if our veterans have to wait on line they go out to a doctor a local doctor we paid the bill and they\\'re all set there aren\\'t the wait for six weeks right he\\'s agreeing right good right you don\\'t see those stories you know you used to see all these horrible vet stores right veterans the veterans on television and you don\\'t see it because veterans choice it\\'s amazing you go out our great veterans here\\'s a man right here you\\'re saying yes right Purple Heart thank you that\\'s great but it\\'s a lot different under Trump is that a lot different under Trump and now you go out to a private doctor but you know we also got accountability they\\'ve been trying to get these things things done for 45 46 48 years couldn\\'t get them done I\\'m good at getting things approved after that but but we also got accountability where we could fire people that aren\\'t taking care of our vets if somebody isn\\'t doing a good job you couldn\\'t fire them now you look at him you say get the hell out of here you\\'re fired and we passed another thing for 44 years they\\'ve been trying to get it past the spectacular right to try where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill averse sick we can use it and we are having tremendous results right to try I hope that nobody in this room needs it I hope you don\\'t need it but if you do we have the best in the world and we\\'re seeing amazing results we\\'re combating the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years and we are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America\\'s youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing all of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the very moment of birth you know that that is why at my State of the Union I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God the Democrat Party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your Second Amendment that\\'s what it is the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American dream and the late great Abraham Lincoln people forget that people forget Honest Abe he\\'s the most presidential guy right I\\'ve always said I could be more presidential than anybody but I\\'m not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the Hat that hat is too much it\\'s so easy to be presidential so easy it\\'s so much easier than doing what I have to do but you know what I haven\\'t have about three people in the front row how about sleepy Joe how about his performance what what it\\'s great to be it\\'s great to be with the great people of Ohio Joe Joe you\\'re in Iowa you\\'re an island oh he did it five times so far I\\'ve never done it thank you I\\'ve never done it if I do it that\\'s a bad sign now he does it all the time right he was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont great to be in Vermont you know you\\'re in New Hampshire dammit he\\'d go up and tell him again like that Joe what the hell is wrong with you Joe sleepy Joe he\\'s sleepy Joe he was sleepy a long time ago but now he\\'s really sleepy but it\\'s easy to be presidents all right you know that the easiest thing you can do is presidential never open your jacket never it\\'s got to be buttoned up right [Applause] thank you thank you thank you thank you very much it\\'s so great to be with the people of Colorado so good thank you everybody good night good night no no it\\'s so easy you know it\\'s like so easy honestly you get look I did very well with the State of the Union right they said it was one of the best smart eye smart you know smart guy we do good we\\'re representing you I better do good I didn\\'t do good you dumped me so fast actually I don\\'t think you would not be so fast actually you\\'ll know the thing I don\\'t think she said we\\'re never dumping you fake news CNN went up to a woman what does it take for you to leave the president even him there were 10 women the one woman beautiful did like incredible women then they had there been that is they had hats trouble and stupid CNN they go up what does it take for you and then good look he said one time that his people are so good they\\'d stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue you remember right would you say if he shot somebody they\\'d actually this is actually an answer or something to the effect would you say if he shot somebody in the middle Fifth Avenue and the woman looks well it depends why he shot him I thought I was make sense depends why he shot him but then they said we\\'re not leaving him when never leaving him wearing this thing together folks we got this swamp we got that dirty rotten swamp we got crooked politicians we got a lot of bad people but we\\'re getting them out one by one we better be like little Adam shift that little Adam shift what a crooked politician he\\'s a corrupt politician talking about guys he\\'ll lie and then the next day I get caught he\\'ll be sorry that he got caught the next day he\\'ll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing he\\'s got no shame he got no shame he\\'s a lies he\\'s a bad he\\'s actually I think he\\'s a sick person Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background every community in every walk of life you know that with a party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm we are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement we are the big tent we are the big party we have the big ideas for the future Republicans are fighting for school choice big deal it\\'s a big deal because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school to uphold the new rule of law we have confirmed 217 brand-new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written that\\'s a record that is a record and it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime so think of it if they\\'re 40 years old if they\\'re 45 years though they could be there for 4050 years as you know and by the way that\\'s a record by a lot I have the record but there\\'s one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record who has the percentage you know George Washington 100% but it was only 16 people so with 217 can you imagine that it\\'s a record and we\\'re going up we\\'re going up the Democrats are thrilled about that one and as you know I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme Court justices Colorado\\'s own new right Colorado that\\'s right Colorado\\'s own Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh neil corsets that\\'s right Colorado he\\'s a great guy too great guy Colorado that\\'s a big thing that\\'s another great check you have down out Neil Gorsuch I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem they said they were going to do it for you we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights our investments in the United States military include more than three hundred million dollars this year has anyone ever heard of

couple of weeks before and I hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3 and the USA was not on top and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the United States men\\'s hockey team defeated then Soviet Union team in the 1980 Olympics incredible that was incredible most of you remember that looking at we got a lot of young ones but we

great he called up and we gave him a lot of help I was president-elect then because the president didn\\'t want to get involved he didn\\'t want to get involved in getting the Olympics so they called me and I was president-elect hadn\\'t taken office then I got involved and I\\'ll tell you they were happy we got involved it was great it\\'s going to be very exciting today we are thrilled to have with us 14 players of that really incredible gold medal team give him a big hand [Applause] and they were amazed they said boy just a big crowd I said it\\'s only because you guys are coming you know this thing was supposed to be for this evening and they said let me get back to Washington do it early so he gave you almost no notice you have thousands of people outside thousands of people inside you had a scene we\\'re in Iowa we were in New Hampshire you saw what happened in Colorado less that was unbelievable every place we go it\\'s the same it\\'s been incredible I don\\'t know if you saw in the pictures last night of the outside in Colorado it was incredible it was you could have filled that arena up four times that it was a big arena and it\\'s something so I hated to do it to your 12 o\\'clock but I said let\\'s go I want to get back we got a deal with China we got a deal with Russia we got a deal with North Korea South Korea we got a deal with the rest of the world get my people back we got to get the hell out of here right but we have a lot of time I\\'d like down to invite these incredible sport legends to join me on stage a friend of mine and a very good golfer by the way captain bike erode hey bike Mike where\\'s Mike where is it Mike you know is he\\'s a he\\'s a fake handicappers why do you say something just welcome everybody ironic we happen to be here to celebrate our 40th anniversary the Vegas nights flew the whole team out to honor us tonight and for the weekend and we obviously thank the people of Las Vegas for having us here and we\\'re looking forward to celebrating a special time and it\\'s a great honor for the president to invite us to be part of this event as well so Vegas thanks for having us but just tell them am i a good athlete and

that was great goaltender Jim Craig so Jim rebuff to come here Jim great goaltender great goal today they didn\\'t know what was happening they kept shooting he doesn\\'t know how many you rebuffed how many did you rebuff 37 so let me ask was that as goaltender because that was incredible was that the greatest game you ever played you\\'ve had a lot of great games I was slightly important 37 bill Baker bill come on bill bank Dave Christian Ken Morrow Jack O\\'Callahan Mike Ramsey [Applause] those legs took a beating mark wells Neil Broughton John Harrington Rob McClanahan buzz Schneider Dave silk phil verchota and a great coach and assistant coach at the time Craig Patrick [Applause] they said four more years 12 more years let\\'s let him look at that look at the front look a Mike look at the fake dudes back there it\\'s a lot I always say I always say that\\'s like the Academy Awards used to be this year we had a movie they said best movie they announced the movie from South Korea so what\\'s that all about look I get a little great with South Korea but you know I never sort of that one before they used to go on best foreign movie but now we do it that way I don\\'t get it but that\\'s what it used to be and this is really an incredible time I\\'ll tell you what for our country that\\'s why I like to see things that we do get honoured because nobody is doing what we do nobody can do it like us with the greatest country in the world again we have the greatest people we have the greatest military by far we\\'ve totally rebuilt our military jobs are booming incomes are surging poverty is plummeting factories are returning confidence is soaring like these guys the confidence is sorry but you know we do have somebody that I\\'d like to point out because this team is bad a coach and that Coach was a very inspirational and I\\'d like to have maybe one of you come up and just say a few words about coach Brooks because he was very very he was really a big he was a big heart for this team please I think it would be appropriate if you got a few minutes that Herb Brooks his daughter Kelly is here representing her father [Applause] and I can honestly tell you that Kelly was not ready for this at all [Applause] what\\'s it like to take an Eevee on a row that as the single greatest sporting event or athletic achievement I think so yeah number they put it number one certainly tub top five in the history of our country we have a lot of things that we\\'ve done to break records we\\'re going to go over them but we\\'ve broken a lot of records now but I want to thank that great team for being with us very inspirational this is a big day the anniversary in my State of the Union address I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback and we\\'re just getting started after three years of ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat Crusades by the way I think they\\'re starting another one did you see that I see these phonies these that do-nothing Democrats they said today that Putin wants to be sure that Trump gets elected here we go here we go again did you see it a story aren\\'t people bored now does that include because a couple of weeks ago crooked Hillary said Chelsea Gabbard right Tulsi Gabbard and right she was a Russian agent Tulsi and also Stein from Jill Stein I don\\'t know Jill Stein I never met the woman she is a green party candidate or was they said she\\'s an agent of Russia I don\\'t know her and I don\\'t know Tulsi the only thing I know about both of them is they\\'re not agent they are not agents of Russia these people are sick that\\'s pencil-neck pencil-neck again little pencil [Applause] now I just see it again I was told that was happening I was told a week ago they said you know they\\'re trying to start a rumor it\\'s disinformation that\\'s the only thing they\\'re good at they\\'re not good at anything else they get nothing done do not think Democrats did dish that Putin wants to make sure I get elected listen to this so doesn\\'t he want to see who the Democrats gonna be wouldn\\'t you rather have let\\'s say Bernie wouldn\\'t you rather that Bernie who honeymooned in Moscow would never these people are crazy that\\'s all they think about they don\\'t think about the country they don\\'t think about jobs they don\\'t think about lowering your drug costs infrastructure these people are crazy trust me I like I like what we\\'re doing and I love this country [Music] now and I campaigned on it at the same time we want to get along with Russia we want to get along with China we want to get along with all these countries who the hell needs to have conflict but these people are sick they are sick people the radical left\\'s attempts to poison our democracy and overturn the last election have totally ended in a big fat failure and by the way you saw today single best day I\\'ve ever had in the polls and any poll that the fake news gives you because the real numbers are higher but any poll they give you is a fake but Wisconsin the great state of Wisconsin I was leading by many many many points against every one of these characters can you believe it we got a new one many my Kennedy during the debate the other day minibike is a box bike here my phone mini Mike he was a beauty what happened to her he couldn\\'t breathe what happened Mike would like to know how about that Pocahontas screaming at him she forgot she forgot that she lied about her own heritage she said she was an Indian because she had high cheekbones that was the only thing remember when I said I have more Indian blood in me than she has and I have none but I have done to the best of my knowledge wouldn\\'t mind having some but I happened to have none and she choked and she went out and got a report done one 1024 you know what that means that means probably I do have more now why did he bring that up when she was screaming at him why because he was gasping for breath I can\\'t breathe he\\'s got I can\\'t breathe I can\\'t she\\'s hitting me too hard Pocahontas well she won that two Baker\\'s by could not respond that\\'s what they all said they all said that that\\'s footage I won they\\'re all shot it\\'s not me that\\'s saying it figures you faked news people [Applause] now they all said it down who won the debate Trump you know what the way I look at it when fake News CNN oops there goes the camera off red light just went on see I can tell every one of them I know them by heart I know the operators I know the cameraman they\\'re okay they\\'re all on our side by the way there\\'s screamed at get that camera off I don\\'t want to do that get that camera off its gonna be a jump all right I\\'m sorry president dick but how about MSDN see there were sincere and they\\'re owned by people that really are bad I think they\\'re very bad for our country the the owners of Comcast rotten company bad for our country very bad they try it you know they have all these PR things to try and keep their image nice and clean what they do on television is so disgusting I think in the old days you had have licenses for this stuff right they can say whatever they want to saying let\\'s see what happens over the next period of time budget dishonest people Comcast terrible company terrible people running that company and you know what I had Celebrity Apprentice I had the apprentice on for 14 seasons 14 seasons [Applause] and they used to come to my office and they would kiss my ass please sign please saw you know it\\'s an interesting story they came and we signed you know who signed me Jeff Zucker it\\'s one of the only things he\\'s done good in broadcasting but I signed and NBC as you know is owned by Comcast but I signed and they figured the show would be a total failure so they only signed before once he said you know I was gonna have it was go on and then the show goes started at 10:00 went to 8:00 went to 7:00 went to 5:00 went to four went to two it went to one I had the number one show on all of television it was a phenomenal phenomenal and the final episode remember that with do you remember that you remember the final we had I don\\'t know it was like one of the biggest shows of the year was a tremendous success but here I was I signed with NBC and they didn\\'t even want to waste the ink on an option usually they have an option for not you know just like they didn\\'t do it you stupid people so they paid me very little for the first season I think $25,000 a show which is you know considered like not good that\\'s okay it was fun I didn\\'t know it\\'s gonna be success you know hey just like this was successful it\\'s a recent because when I left then Arnold Schwarzenegger and I like Arnold said some very nice things yet that is I\\'m not but the show did not exactly succeed when I left but I had it on and they wanted me to sign for more and I said no I\\'m gonna run for president but I\\'ll never forget I looked at I didn\\'t know anything about this business and I had an agent wonderful guy from William Morris and he said sir I don\\'t want you to sign no business show has ever done well on network television well what\\'s that business it\\'s entertainment slash sir I don\\'t want you to sign sir don\\'t sign I said yeah okay but I have a problem I shook the hand of somebody I have to and Mark Burnett was great he was guy and but we shook hands so I have to but I agreed you know I didn\\'t know that no business you know business type show had ever succeeded on a network television so he said I don\\'t want you to son sir break it I said I can\\'t break it can\\'t break it anyway so the show I said started at 10:00 went and I went it became it was the number one show all of a sudden and the agent called me up and he said sir I remember 6:00 in the morning I was in bed he said sir the show just went to number one I\\'d love to see you because I think I\\'m entitled to more money I said you didn\\'t want me to do the show well not really I mean I was okay he said I\\'d really like more money I said Jim I liked you very much Jim you\\'re fired get out anyway I had 14 great seasons over about eleven years because in some it was so successful they kept red they would have run it remember when they did the three hours the whole night was the apprentice they said wait a minute Gone with the Wind to mention the movie the second time gone with the wind is shorter they had the apprentice thrown for three hours I said even I gets too long you can\\'t put it up for three you gotta leap a little bit like I want to come back next week but they had it on for three weeks we did fantastically with it Comcast did great NBC did great they wanted me to sign for another three years I said no I\\'m gonna run for president and that was actually the time when I knew I was going to run cuz you know they were paying a lot of money and whether you\\'re rich or not it\\'s still a lot of money I don\\'t care how rich yards a lots of millions and millions of dollars and I said no I\\'m gonna run for president and I did that but from the day I ran they went from being you know wonderful they were nice they were you know they were nice I guess if I didn\\'t do well with the show they wouldn\\'t have been nice because they weren\\'t nice to other people that failed you know people that didn\\'t have good ratings that businesses are very simple business if you have good ratings you can treat them like garbage if you have bad ratings you can say sir I really respect you so much they\\'re very ruthless people but comcast is a rotten company they forgot totally and they are worse than CNN I will tell you that right now comcast is worse than CNN we should call it Comcast because that\\'s their beautiful maiden name Comcast they\\'re worse than CNN I\\'ll tell you something about CNN Jake Tapper today he put out now I know you don\\'t like him I know who do who likes him who the health care like I think his wife likes him actually I really believe she does but let me just tell you he put out a couple of social media posts today cuz I never called it tweet I called it social media because it\\'s much bigger than tweet what we have dance Kavita the great dance Covino we have one five sites we\\'re number one on twitter we\\'re number one on Facebook in the whole world in the whole world so it\\'s powerful but Jake Tapper put out some things basically saying I believe it that\\'s the way I read it that the new Russian thing that started yesterday that Putin wants to be sure the trumpets give me a break they have a a break but Jake Tapper said it ain\\'t so and if he did say that because there were little complex you know they can turn him around or when zuker sees him and said why did you put that I want that deleted and I want you to do a different one but he did say that so I respect that because it\\'s another hoax story but we\\'re standing up for the defense of our Constitution for our freedom and democracy itself you know I gotta get there hey Bobby I love this shirt Bobby I don\\'t know he looks like a nice guy can you please welcome up even if you have about five come here come in come on come here you gotta see this shirt you got to see this shirt I love it I\\'ll get an order me one that I can ride around come on come on up here he looks safe he doesn\\'t look like he\\'s gonna start a fistfight he\\'s a good fan I guess you got to see this shirt I love it is there any place that\\'s more fun than a trump rally right how many rallies have you been to 80 he said 80 rallies come up here come come on come on look at these two guys these guys are serious these are serious fans right are you with him are you with him are you with him you with him come on come up man [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Wow I just said how long have you two been together I figured that say you know a man he met her at the rally in Colorado can you believe do you believe it man did he get lucky they both got lucky right well it\\'s cool no I just see there\\'s so much stuff out here it\\'s genius actually while the extreme left has been wasting America\\'s time with vile hoaxes we\\'ve been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages and acting fair trade deals securing our border lifting up citizens of every race color religion and Creed as you heard we added another 225 thousand new jobs last month alone way above anticipated schedule and that makes seven million new jobs since the election the number was supposed to be under two million and we added seven million and remember if I give you wrong numbers the fake news is going to have headlines Trump gave you wrong I mean it\\'s very tough I\\'ve got to be very careful even if I give you wrong in the wrong way they\\'ll say it was wrong I said yeah but it was wrong in the low wage no that\\'s still good either get it be exactly very precise with these characters the Democrats don\\'t have to be but we have to be we\\'ve destroyed the ISIS territorial Caliphate 100 percent we killed the founder and leader of Isis al Baghdadi is dead al Baghdadi is dead 17 years they look for him 17 years [Applause] al baghdadi one of the first things I did when I came in you know he\\'s the founder of Isis and when I came in three years ago Isis was all over the place and I said you got to knock it out we knocked it out of Syria in Iraq and other places we really docked it 100% remember I want to leave I said all right we were at 96% then 98 then 99 percent I said let some of these other countries do it wouldn\\'t you say right so what happened is I wanted to leave and they said no no no we want a hundred percent so we wait and stayed we got a hundred percent that we moved them all out of Syria except we did keep the oil you notice that right we kept the other sorry they said he left soldiers in Syria I did to keep the oil of you know mine which is what we should have done in Iraq too by the way I would have done that and make it a lot of money with all that oil but you remember that whole thing that whole I said you got to find out Baghdady I\\'ve been saying that actually for two years I had a lot of other things to do the first year like fight off the Democrats these crazy Democrats were they\\'re hoaxing with their helps us think of it if they use their genius because they are genius at that stuff right they\\'re really good they can take nothing they can take a perfect phone call made to the Ukrainian president who said very specifically there was no pressure he doesn\\'t even know what\\'s going on and they can take this perfect call thank goodness I had a transcriber do you agree with it because the fake whistleblower the fake whistleblower said that the call was totally different than what the call was so when I released the call when I release the transcripts they died they said ah we got a problem they never thought I was gonna do it but I had no choice I had to because I had to show they\\'re liars but think of it they can take something like that a perfect phone call or they\\'ll take just out of thin air they can make something up and they ended up today front page New York Times they used to call it the 8th column that\\'s the big column on the right I don\\'t know the papers become so small I don\\'t know if they have an eighth column they used to have the eighth column was a big deal right that was the big deal today it\\'s too narrow I think they\\'re probably after I\\'m gone they won\\'t have any columns that\\'s why eventually they\\'re going to support me eventually The Times and The Washington Post which would be dead as a doornail after I live and the CNN it\\'ll be an obsolete business the cable business MS DNC will be out of business you know cable was supposed to be obsolete and now they\\'re doing the highest numbers they\\'ve ever done if an aeroplane goes down with 700 people they don\\'t cover it if it\\'s not Trump related they don\\'t cover it it\\'s got to be Trump or Trump related so the plane goes down and it\\'s total devastation if the ship goes down if the Titanic if the Titanic equivalent went down they wouldn\\'t cover it unless I was on the sucker they wouldn\\'t cover it the fake news would not cover the equivalent of the Titanic but you know what they\\'re gonna do before the election they\\'re gonna say we water just say something we\\'re gonna endorse the president you know why cuz they\\'ll be out of business can you imagine if they had to cover mini Mike who I don\\'t think I think he\\'s gone but you know what he\\'ll spend another 500 million don\\'t forget I spent 70 and I won of my money in other words they said and this was in the New York Times I said it the other night in Colorado I spent 70 mini Mike so far I spent almost 500 million dollars in order to get embarrassed by Pocahontas poka hot and she\\'s mean isn\\'t said you see death do you see the anger on her face that nervous energy says like a jumping up and down she\\'s a mess but no no she\\'s mean right right she that faces just you wanted to get him she said I\\'d get him I want to see those agreements I do open up those agreements this poor guy probably signed a hundred of them and and each one\\'s a disaster he said I don\\'t want to open those agreements nobody told me this was gonna happen he said actually said nobody told me get me out of here you know after the debate he went backstage fired a lot of people he said how the hell did you get me into this thing but anyway but Pocahontas was really mean but she\\'s gonna be easy I hope it\\'s her she it\\'s not gonna be her she made a little comeback the other night because she took mini Mike to the cleaners but it\\'s not gonna be here it can\\'t be booted edge can\\'t be out all day Alfred he knew me ladies and gentlemen introducing President Alfred e Newman but see nobody knows cuz you\\'re all too young nobody knows who Alfred it\\'s Mad Magazine they all said no Howdy Doody see nobody knows who Alfred aluminous only the real aficionados they\\'re the ones that they love it but that\\'s only 15% of the crowd right am i right better than Howdy Doody and how\\'d he do it but he\\'s got a look you know he\\'s got to worry about his own City it\\'s going to hell so he\\'s got a worry because that city\\'s got a lot of problems I don\\'t get I don\\'t get the whole thing but he\\'s not a bad debater I will say he\\'s probably the best up there Bernie is too emotional he\\'s screaming going crazy and bite is angry Biden is angry everything\\'s anger gee ha ha and that\\'s what happens when you can\\'t get the words out no it does that\\'s what happens right when you can\\'t get the words out you get angry you get angry because you can\\'t get the words that might happen to me someday can you imagine if that happened to me man would I be a bad guy I\\'d be the meanest man in history no but Biden is very angry you know he gets angry and angry and angry he\\'s changed and then you have that time yeah he said Tom Steyer Tom sir mr. impeachment how did that work out Tom thank you very much for the great poll numbers between him and nervous dancing out of that workout this Schmo spends 250 million dollars he ends up with 1/3 of a percent in Iowa but maybe that you know that could be Rinker\\'s they still don\\'t have any idea what he got maybe he won Eyre where they took it away from now but he was substantially below it said all I know it said 1% at an arrow left so he spends two hundred and fifty million Tom\\'s side never heard of this guy who is he where did he get his money who is he you know he was in the coal business did you know that this guy this phony is a big environmentalist he made his money a lot of it in the coal business nobody knows that but he\\'s a fake remember when he walked up to Bernie the other day hi Bernie hi oh and he was having a fight with Pocahontas right his is the greatest Mark Burnett said is the greatest reality show in history he said you can take the apprentice and you could take survivor and you can take every other reality show ever made multiply it times 10,000 and you still don\\'t have what we have and even the cast you did say this you got the perfect president you got the perfect first lady how about the first one you got the perfect kids the kids though those beautiful kids my beautiful kids they had such a great life before I did this sorry kids sorry my beautiful Ivanka she had such a great life she had a company that was selling shoes and everything you could sell she just put her name on it and she said daddy it doesn\\'t matter I want to come to Washington and help people get jobs that\\'s her and she left the company and you know when you leave a company all of a sudden it doesn\\'t do as well I wouldn\\'t say that I exactly helped talking about the wall but she left the company came to Washington and she said 500,000 jobs that was her goal and she did that in the first month she actually did she\\'s gotten these great companies like Walmart and many others Exxon she\\'s gotten them to take millions of people she\\'s now over 15 million jobs where they train people and bring them into the companies it\\'s incredible 15 million and she\\'s smart you know she\\'s got it figured out but not most people can\\'t but she does but but all they do is give them heat they work so hard and could you imagine you take you take Biden son can you imagine you know I deal with all these big companies in these great great countries I think I could get my son\\'s 25 board ships for millions of dollars apiece my kids would be back but you know what we don\\'t do any of that stuff we don\\'t do that so we don\\'t do it the kid got three million dollars eighty-three thousand a month and he didn\\'t have a job until his father became vice president and speaking of vice presidents and speaking of vice presidents okay and speaking also of reality television because there\\'s the greatest show of all time right look at this look we told you what last night little change there folks we\\'re gonna move it up from eight o\\'clock in the evening till 12 o\\'clock in the afternoon little change just a monitor because I have to get back to Washington and work I feel guilty this is too much fun but speaking of vice presidents and speaking of perfect vice presidents you know if you become president the first thing you have to do is choose a really horrible horrible vice president so if the idiots ever want to impeach you they have to say I can\\'t impeach him look we got look who we have I have the perfect vice president I have the greatest in the world I have the greatest vice president I got the great ones I said you know I can\\'t do that I picked a great guy he\\'s done a fantastic job he\\'s been a great vice president but it is true I could have picked I\\'ll give you names but I don\\'t want to do that because I don\\'t want to hurt anyone\\'s feelings but there plenty of them out there mostly out there and I don\\'t want to do that but Mike Pence has been great but tell me is it perfect casting the whole thing and this isn\\'t about casting this is about in real life but when Mark Burnett said to me the other day he said the greatest reality show of all times times a million and his that\\'s exactly except for one thing we work our asses off and we are doing things like nobody has ever done before right so we took out our bag daddy and then we just took out two weeks ago the world\\'s top terrors Qasem Soleimani of Iran ending his evil reign of terror forever he\\'s the father of the roadside bomb when you see our beautiful people walking around with no legs they\\'re walking and trying to walk so hard and they were brilliant rough shape they have incredible the job the doctors do it Walter Reid in some of these hospitals and they get him to a point where sometimes they really can they walk around and but it\\'s hard and they lose legs and then lose arms that was Salib a knee he\\'s the father of the right he loved the roadside bomb he thought it was a great thing where is he now salivating and I\\'ll tell you what you know who is happy about it the people of Iran are happy and even the leaders of Iran because the leaders of Iran were afraid of him okay and the fact is America is respected again we\\'re winning we\\'re winning all over we\\'re winning in Washington that Democrats keep losing their minds that is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement is that they\\'re joining the Republican Party through we have a lot of look at the energy in this room they\\'re all fighting they\\'re all fighting we\\'re not we\\'re unified party the Republican Party has never been unified like it is today I mean I say I could say we\\'re gonna go over to the hill no we\\'re gonna go over to someplace and we\\'re gonna do a rally at eight o\\'clock tonight we\\'d have tens of thousands of people there\\'s never been this you know Ronald Reagan was great I thought he was a great guy great president didn\\'t like his policy a trait that\\'s okay trade but if he came to Las Vegas you know they\\'d have a ballroom and they\\'d have five hundred maybe a thousand people what we\\'re doing and this isn\\'t even I must say this I don\\'t want to tell you this this is not election season because we\\'re nine months away you know election season is one year two months away we\\'re not even in election season and we have more enthusiasm now believe it or not than we had even before the election in 2016 [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so we have a great gentleman and woman with us a friend of mine mr. and mrs. sheldon adelson right over here great great person two great people he\\'s got so much money he doesn\\'t know what the hell to do with it he owns the Sands Hotel that\\'s like one of her smaller businesses Sheldon that\\'s like your small business right he is

of hundred million dollars too much he said give it to him it\\'s peanuts what the hell differences of it we want to thank the Adelson\\'s they\\'ve been incredible fans and they love Israel they love Israel I just saw him sitting there I didn\\'t know they were here I just see him sitting there ah he\\'s something the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party who\\'s really been great he\\'s been with me for a long time and he\\'s a very committed man make America great again you know this oh-oh-oh let\\'s do a poll quick just quick you know I\\'ll never get rid of Mecca because I\\'m superstitious but you know we just hit an all-time high with the stock market our military\\'s rebuild you just got the greatest tax cuts in history the greatest rate regulation cuts and all this stuff so let me ask you this so make America great again said if doesn\\'t work quite as well so now we have Keep America greater we have the new hat higher stiff it\\'s like a billboard right I call it the billboard it\\'s a billboard so let\\'s go just that occurs I am very surprised by we\\'re gonna keep a boat but I just curious if we did go to one make America great again Keep America great I would have said that\\'s impossible make America great again is the greatest phrase a lot of people again fake reduce I think we\\'ll agree to it it\\'s the greatest phrase ever used in politics it\\'s the greatest friends now who has the greatest phrase ever used in the history of politics and say oh let\\'s go with the new phrase right but we\\'re gonna keep so we have to keep Magath but now we have CAG now we have cat so we have a both I just don\\'t have the courage to get rid of the water would be too disrespectful too disrespectful but Michael McDonald I want to thank you and the members of the Nevada Republican Central Committee you\\'re all here the great people and a man came here he loves us he\\'s been with us Rick Harrison of the world famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop Rick Harrison you better win Michael otherwise that\\'s the less time I\\'m introducing you like that I hear were up by here we\\'re doing nicely I hear we\\'re doing great and by the way the Union I have a lot of respect for that Union you know last time I had a strike in my building during the election it\\'s the only reason we would have won this state I\\'m like brilliantly to save three cents I could have settled this strike before the election I wanted to save two dollars total that was a brilliant move and then we had some guy running guy named Hecht and he wasn\\'t too good he didn\\'t do too good but we almost won this day despite I had a big strike at thousands and thousands of Union guys they had it you know look they wanted you know one to show us but I think that the unions are really with us and the unions have been with us the Teamsters so many of the unions because I\\'m for the working man and woman whether you\\'re union or non-union some states are all Union sub states or no Union but we get them all and I think we\\'re gonna have tremendous success and you know a lot of the Democrats are going to ruin the health care programs that these unions have the unions have worked hard on health care and they\\'re going to ruin them they\\'re going to take away a hunt well with it you can lose a hundred and eighty million people off of great private health care so we\\'ll see what happens but a lot of the Democrats want to do that they think it\\'s wonderful but together we\\'re building the world\\'s most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society that\\'s true since my election over 125,000 new jobs have been created right here in Nevada including over 40,000 new Nevada manufacturing and construction jobs a 30% increase the national unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century and soon we\\'re going to have so we\\'re gonna have that be a historic number like so many of the others the average unemployment rate for my administration this is the coolest of them all is the lowest for any United States president in recorded history that\\'s pretty good that\\'s pretty good when I\\'m going to debate this saying we\\'re going to do this so what I said listen we have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country african-american unemployment hispanic american hispanic we got a lot of Hispanic I love Hispanic who in this audience is Hispanic yeah we\\'re doing great well we should be doing great you have the lowest ever recorded lowest unemployment rates ever recorded Asian Americans likewise the lowest ever recorded the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest rate in 71 years African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time historic low people I love people I might have helped more than anybody because of choice and accountability the veterans unemployment rate dropped to the lowest record employment lowest in history the unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time historic low and you got to remember they\\'re back there checking every word that got over oh he\\'s right he\\'s right he\\'s right I can\\'t say it because I got all these maniacs back there they\\'re trying to fight you know he put the comma in the wrong place he didn\\'t make that word plural therefore he lied he lie now I got to be very accurate because all these numbers they check them out as they check up there in there check it out check on the african-american unemployment please please tell me please tell me it\\'s not historic these people are among the most dishonest human beings on earth not all of them not all of them workers without a high school diploma we have billions of people they didn\\'t go through high school they left they had problems good problems bad problems families where they don\\'t have the money they didn\\'t get a high school diploma they\\'ve achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in the history of the United States important groups of people half a million more Hispanic Americans now own a home now Hispanic have done so good and by the way you know who understands the border because we are building that wall like crazy you know who understands remember they also know if you build the wall you lose the Hispanic vote I said I got to do what\\'s right you know who understands the border better than anybody you know who understands crime at the border better than anybody the Hispanics understand it and they don\\'t want to be working and have people come and take their job have people come in where they can\\'t pay for their house have people come in who are very very bad people you have some very bad people you have murderers and rapists and we have said all sorts of records at the border but we\\'re up to 122 miles of wall and it is true the people that understand it the best are Hispanic so thank you and to make our country safe and to make our country safe we\\'ve lifted 10 million people off of welfare median household income is now the highest ever recorded in our country think of that President Bush I say it all the time President Bush eight years four hundred and fifty dollars President Barack Hussein Obama eight years eight years nine hundred and seventy-five dollars president Donald John Trump three years it\\'s actually less when they did the numbers three years including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts three years so you had four fifty nine hundred and seventy-five dollars that\\'s eight and eight now we\\'re down to three years little less three years ten thousand dollars per family a year ten thousand a year our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and ending the tyranny of federal bureaucrats I deal with them that good it\\'s called the swamp we\\'ve ended the war on American energy lowering utility bills reducing prices at the pump reducing your prices part of that number is all of the the money that we save at the pump in on electric I also recently took action on an issue Nevada has been dealing with for over 30 years Yucca Mountain you know you come on my budget stops funding for the licensing of waste storage at Yucca Mountain so that we can focus on positive solutions and for much better reasons and alternatives why should you have nuclear waste in your backyard why should you have nuclear waste in your backyard I won\\'t say which countries but you know what other countries there I will not say which one they put it on her ship they floated out into the middle of the ocean they find a nice deep spot they dump it that\\'s the end of it but we would never do that for environmental reasons we are reversing decades so Yucca Mountain you\\'re okay please okay just relax you have somebody sheldon you have somebody in your newspaper back there who can write Yucca Mountain please he\\'ll call up y\\'all come out and is okay that\\'s the end of that that\\'s the end of that so Yucca Mountain you\\'re in great shape maybe they could finally report it properly but we\\'re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies for years Washington politicians took money from lobbyists global corporations and corrupt special interests to ship our jobs and factories and all of this stuff and all of this wealth Asolo well they shipped it overseas and to other countries America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the WTO the World Trade Organization probably an even worse deal for us than NAFTA that\\'s possible but under my administration the great betrayal of America is over America is no longer for sale [Applause] last month we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand-new US Mexico Canada agreement u.s. MCA see we played the song YMCA cuz that\\'s the only way you\\'re about just think of the song YMCA think of the song and you remember that us MCA is a gigantic victory for farmers ranchers and manufacturers all across the great state of Nevada I also took the strongest ever action to confront China\\'s massive theft of American jobs our strategy worked last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement probably the biggest agreement of any kind ever signed with China that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property and boost American exports by a lot China will be buying two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of goods from us now and fifty billion from our farmers my guys wanted 16 I said make it 50 my guys wanted 16 they got China up to 20 I said nope gotta make it 50 then I said to China you got a billion and I have people what difference does it make they said you\\'re right fifty billion I don\\'t think our farmers can produce that much but we\\'re gonna soon find out they\\'re gonna buy very large tractors after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country we are finally putting America first or no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration before I came into office the far left policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country poisoning our children including right here in a very very big way the great state of Nevada Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the well-being of American citizens you know that you\\'ve been complaining about for a long time so one of the reasons you voted for Trump they want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border and then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare of health care of lots of other things including education all paid for by the taxpayers of the United States illegal immigration costs Nevada taxpayers think of it more than 1.6 billion dollars every year over $1,500 per household for the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants we could rebuild every city all of these distressed areas in the United States throughout our country the money we spend it\\'s not even thinkable and don\\'t forget would we say come like in California the clown he says come come we\\'ll give you free health care people that weren\\'t even thinking about coming that\\'s why we have caravans of people that were turning back Mexico\\'s been great by the way they gave us twenty seven thousand soldiers on our board [Applause] but when a governor nice guy actually is a nice guy we just got to explain the facts of life he\\'s a nice good Oh doctor please doctor doctor in the house please medic oh please a doctor thank you thank you take your time take your time we got plenty of time [Applause] take your time please you know a lot of these people have been here for three days it\\'s a lot those front row people are tough [Applause] take your time doc take your time thank you everybody thank you doctor thank you let\\'s sue they get here so they stand and sit and sometimes days early in Colorado they\\'re there three four days early it\\'s tough it\\'s tough and we work it and make sure that you have everything you want number one we cover the facts and number two we want to have a good time because we have to have a good time you have to have a good time but things like that happen happen a lot because at after two three days it\\'s not easy and these are strong people I\\'m not gonna fight any of them okay now amazing people thank you very much thank you under my administration we\\'re finally taking care of our own citizens first including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws pay their taxes lift up our society and are entitled to a government that protects their families and protects their communities every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent people you know what\\'s happening you know what\\'s going on in this region alone last year ice officers and they\\'re Patriots they\\'re strong tough Patriots if we didn\\'t have them they\\'d remove thousands and thousands of ms-13 gang members a year and plenty of others who else is going to do it iczer officers arrested over 5000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and even murder many murders in western Nevada and illegal alien was charged with robbing and brutally executing four victims last year right here in Las Vegas three ms-13 gang members abducted a man tied him up with his shoelaces shot him repeatedly and hacked him to death with a machete you know exactly what I\\'m talking about it\\'s right here in your place in Las Vegas right here they hacked him to death tied up and hack them to death yet left-wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens even convicted criminals and murderers and they support deadly sanctuary cities [Applause] you know I say this all the time and I just how the hell I mean where are they coming from I don\\'t get it right seriously I don\\'t get it thanks you\\'re our city\\'s imperil American lives by releasing dangerous criminal aliens directly into your communities if you want to shut down sanctuary cities if you want to protect your family and your loved ones you must vote Republican in 2020 and you have some great ones here Michael thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row and as the wall gets longer it gets easier and easier remember when the Democrats were saying you don\\'t need a wall you know two things that never change right all these computers they said use drones oh great we\\'ll fly over with drones watch the people pour in by the thousands well that\\'s great use drones you know before I came along they all wanted a wall they just did not have built it that don\\'t clue they had no clue they had no true they had the money that they had note they actually gave the money back but they had no clue but as soon as I came in and I said wall wall wall they went against and I made a terrible terrible mistake you know they were saying never admit mistakes I do but I\\'ll admit a mistake now I should have said we will never ever under any circumstances build a wall they would have given me so much money for a wall job or they would have forced me to build I made a terrible mistake right terrible is that so if it ever happens again which it won\\'t this wall is one of a kind will say we will not build the wall and they\\'ll say we demand that you build the wall and it would have been so easy illegal crossings are down 75 percent since last spring and we have ended catch-and-release horrible we catch him you know discern they come over could be a killer murder rapist they come over we can\\'t do anything we have to be politically correct we catch them we then say what\\'s your address they don\\'t know they don\\'t even know their country in many cases where do you come from we don\\'t know and they mean it but some are very serious criminals so we catch them we take whatever they could take which is nothing and then we had to release them in our country we can\\'t bring them back and then we have a system of judges thousands of judges all over the place you got to be like Perry Mason and everybody every illegal that comes in they have the lawyers you know the lawyers meet them they get fees they get paid fees but we\\'re breaking the system no more catch and release you think that was easy and the big thing is that 30 foot and this wall is built exactly to the specifications of Border Patrol totally and Border Patrol has seized the largest amount just recently of deadly narcotics ever recorded the largest about we\\'ve deported record numbers of gang members we\\'ve done more to secure the border than any Administration in history we are as I said building the wall faster than ever faster and bigger than anyone thought possible they can\\'t believe we\\'re getting it done we\\'ll have over 500 miles of wall built sometime next year 500 mile Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now 132 congressional Democrats have now signed up for Bernie Sanders takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans many of them in this room of their private coverage remember President Obama remember he said you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan 28 times he lied so we should impeach him we should have picture we\\'re gonna pizza will do it belated impeachment we\\'re gonna do it a belated every 28 times you can keep your doctor right remember you could keep your doctor you could get other unfortunately when they found out you can\\'t keep your doctor he said I was just kidding now we should impeach him we\\'ll do a belated impeachment fake news you hammer so you have to be very careful when you say impeach it because you know what they do they go back and they write they write President Trump said that Obama should be but he\\'s not in office and so therefore they can\\'t be he doesn\\'t know what he\\'s talking about because he\\'s not in office so therefore they can\\'t so they have to be very careful that\\'s why I use the word belated impeachment belated meaning I\\'m just kidding okay they do it all the time they had it the other their said bring back on with the wind right I said the movie I said a little bit up here but I said the movie the other day in Colorado I guess I said South Korean movie would you know they said ladies and gentlemen the winner of the Academy Award is under the rule a movie made in South Korea I said what\\'s this all about and I deal with them they like me we\\'re helping them a lot they\\'re killing us on trade you know they beat us in trade and then they win the Academy Award for a freaking movie but we redid that trade deal but the other day they got me of this one too I said whatever happened to Gone with the Wind that beautiful movie Vivien Leigh Clark Gable right whatever happened bring back on with the wind and some of them wrote he doesn\\'t know that that movie was made like in 1936 so anybody sitting Jesus fake news it is fact is they\\'re fakers but now anybody sitting there reading they\\'re saying man joke can\\'t be that smart you know he said bring back on with the wind that\\'s it all movie yeah it\\'s an old classic bring back make what I say is make great movies you know not this computerized crap computerized garbage and I was never a fan of Brad Pitt I will tell you no I thought he was a stiff he was like a stiff you know it\\'s like a boring guy all of a sudden he wins the Academy well it\\'s a fitting their ratings aren\\'t so good in the academy award you know when that\\'s up when they started attacking us their ratings went right down the tubes you know I told somebody the evening newscast you know they\\'re terrible for conservative people and if they\\'re crooked they\\'re absolutely dishonest I said to one of the big broadcasters I\\'m friendly with them I said you know if you ever did a conservative newscast instead of have you know you got ABC is terrible terrible NBC is just absolutely atrocious and they do badly you know not a lot of people are watching they used to where we had the late great Walter Cronkite and these legends right but ABC is terrible and NBC is terrible and CBS is terrible they\\'re all the same and I said you know your ratings think if you would do a newscast that\\'s conservative I\\'d get them a host I could recommend guys right now right I\\'d get up my house we\\'ll call up we\\'ll call up don\\'t take Sean Hannity away from us cool don\\'t take our show that\\'s my problem I don\\'t want to take away any of our people you get a Pete Haig set you get a Jess you orders you get I mean I could name so many of them right and you put them on that broadcast that ratings would go up fivefold but they don\\'t know that I don\\'t know this stupid there\\'s stupid there\\'s stupid their ratings would go through the roof but they would rather have a failed broadcast that nobody watches then put on a conservative person and lift the ratings five times they would rather have a fail just like they were hoping seven months ago you know we had a little skid and they were hoping the market would crash because they would rather lose their money or big parts of it and have a really horrible market on the basis that we not may we could not be elected on November third this is how evil that\\'s this is now crazy there they\\'ve gone crazy I guess you call it Trump derangement syndrome but if they ever did a conservative broadcast meaning very fair very honest but if it\\'s almost like what I say that it\\'s almost like do a fair broadcast just lets me every case that thing would be the hottest show but they don\\'t realize it and if they do they probably wouldn\\'t do it anyway because they don\\'t want to go away from what they\\'re doing which is crazy because it is they are doing very poorly while the social and socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American health care in your Social Security they\\'re putting it at risk my administration is protecting your social security number they said four years ago in the debates and you had this crazy woman I mean I hate to mention her name I did it you know yesterday through all the runs hater she\\'s a zero zeros got zero television personality zero a be Stoddard whoever that is she said Donald Trump lost all of his debates I want every debate and maybe I don\\'t know baby one somebody but I want with tremendous nothing he said you always we try I\\'ll tell you that and we\\'re winning now but this crazy woman who\\'s got zero going zero she\\'s a Donald Trump lost his debate said he won you know she was talking about how badly been he might did so she said well Donald Trump no I won every single debate I want him against crooked Hillary I want him in the primaries like fifteen or sixteen debates and for some reason you know sometimes you do say does not a big deal nobody watches her nobody cares nobody even knows who she is I just made her famous right she\\'s nothing she\\'s nothing she\\'s got no talent got nothing she\\'s probably got a little Drive that\\'s how she keeps getting on television other people don\\'t have her drive but you know what I said that\\'s really unfair so I took out the polls Time magazine Drudge good guy Drudge Drudge took out a lot of different things and we put up the Drudge poll the Time magazine and many others and some of them had me down like at 91% and then there have many people and I can\\'t rush out because many of those people are now great friends of mine some of them are great Republican senators I\\'m not going to show results but I\\'m holding it up just quickly glancing I caught a glancing blow but we won the debates and I have this fake news person saying Donald Trump did very poorly in the debates I want every debate easily I never did it before remember my first question I said Rosie O\\'Donnell there was one of my best answers Rosie O\\'Donnell who violated the campaign finance laws as badly as anybody I\\'ve ever seen and nothing happens to her right and yet Enosh by violate that he made a little mistake and they want to destroy him so we pardoned him by the way he made a mistake Rosie O\\'Donnell that was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws but dinesh Canisius is they wanted to put him in jail I don\\'t know I think he might have even gone to jail for a period of time for doing something that was really very understandable Rosie O\\'Donnell five times what she did is incredible nothing happens and then she gets on and says what a bad guy are you I\\'m not a bad guy but it\\'s really a disgrace you know it\\'s a disgrace I\\'m glad they didn\\'t do anything with her frankly because you don\\'t want to do for something like that but you know what how did they take we have two sets of justice in this country it\\'s no good it\\'s no good it\\'s no good you know you know the thing we\\'re working on right now we\\'re trying to get fairness for a certain person who\\'s been treated very unfairly a man who a man who had a juror who was a radical anti Trump person and she didn\\'t say that when she went up there and she became the foreperson of the jury and she did terrible things and said terrible things and you know how they caught her when he was convicted and then a statement was made she started jumping up and down screaming yes yes and started telling everybody I quit they said wasn\\'t she just a juror the woman was totally biased how do you do this so I fight look I fight a lot of times it\\'s not worth it but I gotta fight for fairness I gotta fight gotta fight for Thanos very unfair system I guess it\\'s called the swamp I just you know when I said drained the swamp it was a nice phrase I never liked the phrase you know when I was campaigning somehow the phrase came up I think we have a phrase drain the swamp I said I don\\'t like it that\\'s too hokey but one day I was in a big arena 25,000 people packed before the election and I said and we will drain the swamp the place went crazy I said wow you never know you never know Frank Sinatra said his best song I won\\'t tell you which one cuz I\\'ll ruin it for you but his best song is the song that he thought would never make it the song that he liked at least but he said that\\'s the one that was the most successful that the people like you never know so I said drain the swamp and the people went crazy I said well I said let\\'s try that again and the next time I did it again and again and again I only didn\\'t know how disgusting and dirty the swamp is and a lot of the media is a big part of the swamp [Applause] so my administration is protecting you Social Security or Medicare and is fighting to give you great health care we\\'re defending your right to keep your doctor and your plan we\\'re defending that right you\\'re gonna have that right back we\\'re gonna cancel that Obamacare if we could win the case and we\\'re going to give you great health care and we\\'re making health care better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office we\\'re managing it very well we got rid of the individual mandate by far the most unpopular thing where you had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health care right we got rid of it and it was upheld in the Supreme Court what we did every we get sued everything we do if we move if we take ten steps right or left we get sued and we\\'re now offering plans that are up to sixty percent less expensive we\\'re gonna make health care a big part of this campaign we\\'re protecting people with pre-existing conditions that we always will that\\'s why if we are successful you know we\\'re in the Supreme Court to try and get rid of this the carcass it\\'s a carcass known as Obamacare but we\\'re running it much better than they did remember when they had this was the greatest the five billion dollar website five billion was supposed to cost five million I have a son at home he\\'s 13 he\\'s a genius with computers hi dad what\\'s up dad dad get out of here hey listen I\\'m the president of the United States BAM go talk to you dad come on dad can\\'t you see I\\'m playing with my computer the guy talks to me he\\'s working with his computer these guys are genius you know they grow up it\\'s like walking right but he\\'s looking at me I could have given him their health care so he would have done it for nothing and it would have been better than what they have come on dad I\\'m busy then what do you want what do you want did ya whoa Barun whoa wow they\\'re gonna like he\\'s gonna like them he\\'s a he\\'s a good boy he\\'s a tall boy I\\'ll tell you that just turned 13 he\\'s up down said hi Baron how you doing now he\\'s good but they\\'re great with the computers and they spent five billion okay it was gonna cost 50 it was good of course five it was gonna cost fifty there was gonna what was the final number five hundred the number was so the number that they spent five billion dollars right it ended up still doesn\\'t work they spent five billion dollars right and they spent five hundred billion dollars on all of the problems that caused and we\\'ve really straightened it out but it\\'s still lousy health care Obamacare and it\\'s really not Obamacare anymore because when you get rid of the individual mandate it\\'s no longer Obamacare but we\\'re going to terminate it we\\'re going to give you your pre-existing a hundred otherwise I won\\'t do it we\\'re going to give you a brand-new pre-existing and we\\'re gonna have a great health care that\\'s much less expensive and we\\'re fighting to stop surprise medical ability and Berens going to be very happy that I signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very fast you know the man that does this very professionally is great into the healthcare business and you have to be careful when you say it but you know it was just a very strong stay but he said sir price transparency in hospitals where you can bid it out and you can look at the prices right now you can\\'t see if you go to us but they won\\'t even tell you how much it\\'s gonna cost they operate and then they\\'ll give you a bill and you say oh my I had no idea could be they take blood we have one person blood $39 another place the exact same thing $2,500 take flood a blood test once $39 once $2,500 the same test maybe the $39 test is better who the hell knows but it\\'s crazy price transparency and he looked at me goes and he\\'s a real pro one of the top in the country said sir and nobody wanted to do it because it\\'s a little bit controversial and a lot of the drug companies don\\'t exactly love it the hospitals don\\'t love it but I got to do what\\'s right for the people I don\\'t care I\\'m not [Applause] but he looked at me he said and this is why I did it it was one phrase you know what you ever do where you not gonna do something okay then somebody hits you with a perfect phrase he said sir price transparency is bigger than healthcare I said what do you mean by that he said you will see numbers that far outweigh health care hospitals doctors he said you\\'ll be able to price out everything you\\'ll be able to see costs he said price transparency you know people have you\\'ve heard about this for 15-20 years no president has the guts to do and it probably means I won\\'t get campaign contributions from certain people but I\\'m not gonna get them anyway what the hell difference does it make I don\\'t wanna I don\\'t want I got to do what\\'s right you know we\\'re here for a short period of time even if it\\'s a long period it\\'s still a short period and we got to do so price transparency is a big deal he said it\\'s bigger than healthcare think of that bigger than healthcare so let\\'s see what happens but that\\'ll kick in unfortunately that kicks in after the election because we\\'re going through the final stages we\\'re going through a statutory process unfortunately so think of it we\\'re gonna win but let\\'s say let\\'s say the fake news can give me enough phony stories enough bad stuff that we don\\'t make it the new president will get all the credit for price transparency and he won\\'t even know what the hell it is and I took the heat isn\\'t that something but we\\'re gonna win we gotta win for that reason alone we\\'ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as the name-brand drugs but a fraction of the cost and that was another one tremendous political pressure to think of it you own Bayer Aspirin you own all these name name-brand drugs they\\'re making so much money and then a guy comes along said I want to make twenty forms of aspirin they\\'re exactly the same exactly but they don\\'t have a big name on it exactly is good I don\\'t say better I don\\'t say worse they\\'re exactly the same you know people still they want to go out and buy the name you know I do I do you know because it\\'s just because we\\'re stupid no it\\'s true they\\'re exactly the same we\\'re approving so many of the generic drugs a record number nobody\\'s ever approved so much the drug companies hated we also took down the trial periods from 12 years down to five or six years because was they\\'d have a new drug the thing was obsolete by the time it got approved we\\'ve passed a really spectacular thing that they\\'ve been trying to get for 40 some-odd years right to try so you don\\'t have to now go if you get hopefully nobody in this room has those kind of problems right to try and so now you go and you sign a waiver and you get everything and it\\'s great if you\\'re terminally ill if you\\'re very very sick you\\'re not gonna make it and you know why they didn\\'t do it they wouldn\\'t approve it because they didn\\'t want to be sued and they said no this could be dangerous they said the people are terminally ill they\\'re gonna die let him use the experimental drugs don\\'t wait because they have another four or five years before they can come onto the market and it turned out we are having such unbelievable results and you know what else some of those drug companies that now like it if they fought me like crazy because it\\'s really showing if it works there it\\'s really showing that it works it\\'s pretty amazing right to try I hope you don\\'t have to use it we\\'re combating the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years and I\\'ve launched doing.and and this is really something brand new initiatives combating kidney disease and combating Alzheimer\\'s disease we\\'ve made a lot of progress we\\'ve made a lot of progress Sheldon and we\\'re pursuing new advances in the neonatal research to care for America\\'s youngest patients our babies and breaking all records in so doing all of the radical Democrats and the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extremely term abortion ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the very moment of birth this is why in my State of the Union address did you like it that\\'s a different kind of address you know we can go lots of different ways presidential not presidential that was presidential totally yet about three people standing here but I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God the Democrat Party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your very very important Second Amendment the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American Dream and the late great Abraham Lincoln which everybody forgot Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every single walk of life we are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm we are wealthy right we are - are we enthusiastic you know how many of these have done in the last four days people say where the hell do you get your energy I say well the truth

Americans of all parties and political persuasions to join our incredible movement to make America great again we\\'re a very big party we are the party of big ideas for the future Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life was never going to happen we got it done this could not have been done by anyone but the Republican Party and ourselves you know the Democrats have tried for years they couldn\\'t get it done we got it done to uphold the rule of law we are confirmed and this is something they say most important thing you can do judges I say most important thing is defense second is judges a record number of 217 federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written and we have appointed two great new Supreme Court justices Neal Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights we have invested 2.2 trillion dollars to rebuild the United States military including more than

people outside that didn\\'t get if anybody would like to give up where you\\'re standing or your seat please raise your hand now let\\'s begin right thank you all very much oh this is great no they don\\'t get it you know down the road they have a rally for to the people that are going to be running tomorrow they\\'re trying to get to a hundred but they\\'re not gonna make it so I think they\\'re gonna set up a round table you know that\\'s what they do they said so people want to go to a rally they end up sitting at a round table talking about the definition of impeachment crazy crazy it\\'s a crazy deal no the to fake news media they\\'ve been trying to figure this out for years they still don\\'t get it though they don\\'t get it look at all of those cameras look at all of those guys that\\'s a lot of cameras that\\'s a lot of cameras Lindsay and Tim that\\'s a lot of kid they heard you guys were here they heard Tim was here and that Lindsay was here and then and they said we\\'re not going to attend that rally but you know when we heard those two guys plus our great congressman okay here great congressman but this is an incredible time for our nation we\\'re thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the great American comeback in this one jobs a booming income Sasori factories are returning poverty is plummeting confidence is surging and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military our country is stronger than ever before we are stronger we are better but while we\\'re building a great future the radical left Democrats in Washington are trying to burn it all down they have spent the last three years and I could even go further than that three years since the election but we go before the election working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy but with your help we have exposed the far left corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let\\'s see what happens in the coming months let\\'s watch very dishonest people now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus you know that [Music] they are politicizing it we did one of the great jobs you say how\\'s president Trump doing they go oh not good they have no clue they don\\'t have any clue they can\\'t even count their votes in Iowa they can\\'t even they can\\'t count their votes one of my people came up to me and said mr. president they tried to beat you on Russia Russia Russia that didn\\'t work out too well they couldn\\'t do it they tried the impeachment hoax that was on a perfect conversation they tried anything they tried it over and over they\\'ve been doing it since she got in it\\'s all turning they lost it\\'s all turning think of it think of it and this is their new hoax but you know we did something that\\'s been pretty amazing we\\'re 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early we went early we could have had a lot more than that we\\'re doing great our country is doing so great we are so unified the Republican Party has never ever been unified like it is now there has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now never been a movie so a statistic that we want to talk about go ahead say USA it\\'s okay us [Applause] so a number that nobody heard of that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear 35,000 people or an average die each year from the flu did anyone know that 35,000 that\\'s a lot of people it could go to a hundred thousand it could be 27,000 they say usually a minimum of 27 goes up to a hundred thousand people a year die and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States no bother and it doesn\\'t mean we won\\'t and we are totally prepared it doesn\\'t mean we won\\'t but think of it you hear thirty five and forty thousand people and we\\'ve lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode CNN fake news and the camera just went off [Applause] the camera just went off turn it back on hey by the way hold it look look at this and honestly all events are like this it\\'s about us it\\'s all about us I wish they\\'d take the camera show the arena please show them if they never they never do [Applause] they never show the arena you can hear it because when you hear it that\\'s not 200 people that set a hundred people that\\'s thousands and thousands of people including people they always show my face see that face they show my face I wanted to show the arena not my face right how many have you been to how many rallies have you good practically everyone can you believe it I\\'m sure your husband\\'s are thrilled right they\\'re thrilled where are you going tonight I\\'m going to another Trump rally number 114 what do your husband say about that this group of big she said we don\\'t care thank you thank you Democrats will only say horrible things even though they know we\\'re doing a great job we do it a great job with what we have to work with it you\\'ve gotta for the Democrats want us to fail so badly even if their actions and you take a look hurt the people of this country they\\'ll hurt the people themselves their wealth their everything they\\'re willing to hurt our country in order to say bad even if they know it\\'s not so we made an unbelievable deal with Mexico with Canada with China with South Korea with Japan and if you put a microphone that these people back there like the Academy Awards used to be done anymore best best movie of the year it\\'s made in South Korea what\\'s that all about festival I\\'m waiting to see the best movie of the year and it\\'s made he sent his garbage only in South Carolina can you say Oh you\\'re gonna get us in trouble now I\\'m just repeating what he said for the fake snooze I\\'m just now but seriously you know the Academy Awards has gone way way down in ratings you know why because they started attacking us and we don\\'t believe in it anymore that\\'s now but they had the best movie of the year made in South Korea they make enough stuff for us right and they\\'re good they\\'re our friends take advantage of us that\\'s okay not so much anymore we are mek differently we are really you take a look magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world we\\'re prepared for the absolute worst you have to be prepared for the worst but hopefully it will all amount to very little that\\'s why I tell you when we have the flu at 35,000 people and this one is we have to take it very very seriously that\\'s what we\\'re doing we are preparing for the worst my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States we are ready we are ready [Applause] On January 31st I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States an action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody\\'s complimenting me saying thank you very much you were a hundred percent correct could have been a whole different story but I say so let\\'s get this right a virus starts in China bleeds its way into various countries all around the world doesn\\'t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the Democrats single point talking point and you see it is that it\\'s Donald Trump\\'s fault right miss Donald now just things that happen but you know what this does show you things happen whoever thought of this two weeks ago who would have thought this could be going on for weeks ago you wouldn\\'t but things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it and my guys that we have the best professionals in the world the best in the world and we are so ready at the same time that I initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years we had a quarantine some people they weren\\'t happy they weren\\'t happy about it I want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy but after two weeks they got happy you know who got happy the people around them got happy that\\'s who got I also created a white house virus task force it\\'s a big thing the virus task force I requested 2.5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need the Democrats said that\\'s terrible he\\'s doing the wrong thing he needs eight and a half billion not two and a half I\\'ve never had that before he has for two and a half they want to give me eight to have so I said I\\'ll take it does that make me a bit I\\'ll take it I\\'ll take them I never had that beautiful I never had it we won two and a half million that\\'s plenty we demand you take eight and a half he doesn\\'t know what he\\'s doing we want a to half these people are crazy we must understand that border security is also health security [Applause] and you\\'ve all seen the wall is going up like magic it\\'s going up like magic you think that was an easy one that was not an easy one it\\'s going up great and it\\'s we\\'re up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security wanted everything this is everything they wanted 132 miles already we\\'ll have 500 miles built by very early next year sometimes one of the reasons the numbers are so good we will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country we have no choice whether it\\'s the virus that we\\'re talking about or many other public health threats the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and well-being of all Americans now you see it with the coronavirus you see it you see it with the corona boy you know you see that when you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in it\\'s not the only thing that comes in through the border and we\\'re setting records now at the border we\\'re setting records and now just using this so important right so important I\\'m doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the United we\\'ve got phenomenal numbers now it\\'s the worst presidential harassment in history we had a great event yesterday a an event that was so beautiful young african-american leaders one of the things I asked him and I\\'ve been thinking about this for a long time and great people great people some of them are here tonight do you like the name african-american or black and they said black all at the same time no true I tell you because you say african-american are black and they said almost like immediately black but we had an incredible group of people and what happened is NBC it was such a love fest it was selling crab went on for 45 minutes it was a love fest it was incredible NBC turned out there they are right there they turned down Comcast which owns NBC actually NBC I think which is we call it MS DNC right MS DNC but NBC I think is worse than CNN I actually do and Comcast a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image I\\'ll do everything possible to destroy their image because they are they are terrible they\\'re a terrible group of people and they paid me a fortune four years for the apprentice they paid me a fortune and when I left the show is doing great when I left the show 14 seasons think of that he got a big movie star won\\'t tell you his name nobody would know actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time but the show went down the tubes very quickly after the head chopped but the country in five years from now of course you\\'ll want to upset him five years or nine years or 13 years or 18 years [Applause] 10 more years now now or they go crazy when you say it when you say when you say to them five more years so it\\'s fine but you then say maybe nine maybe 13 maybe 17 maybe 21 who knows maybe let\\'s do this let\\'s term limit ourselves at 25 years no more than 25 no more okay they\\'ll pass something in the Senate Tim pass it in the Senate with Lindsey a 25 year term limit please now we\\'re looking to do a great job we need that extra five to get everything solidified you know it\\'s like you take a tree and you plant it it needs some time to grab on right and that\\'s all we need we\\'ve got incredible things that we\\'ve done we have things we still can do but we have done actually much much more than we even promised we do if you think while the extreme left has been wasting America\\'s time with these vile hoaxes we\\'ve been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages and acting frayed Trevor Fairtrade is securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race religion color and Creed we added another 225,000 jobs last month alone and that makes seven million jobs since our election seven million the unemployment rate in the great state of South Carolina you ever hear that plan now sleepy Joe would say the unemployment rate in the great state of Ohio no no you\\'re in South Carolina Joe Joe you\\'re in south to come up and you ever see the guy the note no no it\\'s South Carolina it\\'s not Ohio okay then he goes alright Iowa did you say I wouldn\\'t no no I did that like seven times if I did that once it would be the end of the road right be the end of it they\\'d say Trump is lost it they like to say that anyway I guess huh these people are bad people sleepy Joe well he\\'s running tomorrow no but could you imagine if I said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes which are unbeliever speech I actually said the other night I was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns I said I said that\\'s a horrible thing that\\'s the end of his evening that\\'s the end of his political career and that after the debate they\\'re revealing him they said Joe Biden had a great night last night I don\\'t get it Kim the unemployment rate here in South Carolina has fallen to 2.3 percent the lowest rate in your States the lowest rate in all of America the lowest rate in all of America I said to a friend of mine a Democrat how\\'s the race going tomorrow who\\'s gonna win and he says mr. president now it\\'s very interesting you know he said something he\\'s this guy\\'s a real political Pro - in all fairness even though he\\'s a Democrat but I said who\\'s gonna win he said honestly sir it doesn\\'t matter you are so far ahead in South Carolina that it\\'s meaningless and in North Carolina - in North Carolina we\\'ve destroyed the ISIS territorial Caliphate we killed the founder and leader of Isis al Baghdadi is dead he\\'s dead he\\'s dead and we recently took out the world\\'s top terrorists Kazaam so limini ending his evil reign of terror forever [Applause] but as we keep on winning Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds they\\'ve gone crazy I mean nervous Nancy crying Chuck Schumer crying Chuck a bunch of losers the good citizens of South Carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the Democrat candidates whether it\\'s his character that nobody ever heard of him I never heard I thought I knew all the wealthy people this guy Tom said mr. impeachment how did that work out Tom hey he spent millions and millions of dollars in Iowa right Millions he got less than 1% he got like 1/3 of 1% I I wrote a little note did you see it it said Tom it\\'s not so easy doing what I did is it not so easy that\\'s all you have to do is ask many Mike he\\'s in there for a fortune oh yeah he\\'ll he wish he never started he wished he\\'d never many Mike he wish he never started he said well Trump can do it I\\'m gonna do it too unfortunately it\\'s not working out too well was that the worst debate performance in history I turned on cuz that you know they had a big audience everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what was supposed to be doing up here he turned out to be a total catastrophe that 35 million people can you believe that\\'s a big audience very big and what a killer but this guy steyr he spends all this money he\\'s not that wealthy he spends all of this money and you shouldn\\'t waste your vote on him tomorrow have to be honest the people by the way the Republicans allowed to vote anyway either them are you ready are you ready let\\'s do it together I assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint I assume Lindsay Tim our great congressmen are we allowed to do so am I allowed to request first we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against president [Applause] and then if it\\'s legal I always say if it\\'s permissible by law because they have so many little booby traps but they only like getting the Republicans Democrats skirt right but we\\'ll see what happens about that the Democrats but let me ask you this Lindsay Tim you\\'re pros these are two of the greatest guys I know so let me ask you this so I don\\'t know what the record attendance is in this arena but I was told that we broke it by a lot and you get the people outside are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for cuz you\\'re allowed to skip all right so wait a minute let\\'s do a poll we do this for the fake news back there ready who would be the best candidate for us not for them we\\'re ready ready so let\\'s go through them just quickly we won\\'t include steyr cuz he\\'s a loser he\\'s out we wanted to who would be the best with this is a real pump this isn\\'t one of those fake polls taken by in all fairness I Love You Fox taken by Fox the worst pollster this guy this pulsar hates Trump\\'s guts I was losing the last election by a fortune they said he did great with women what everything was wrong and they never replaced this guy but but watch this you ready so first we\\'ll go let\\'s say sleepy Joe right so right that will go crazy birdy then will go mini Mike I don\\'t think mini Mike I think he\\'s out of it should we include mini mica or not mini mike is gone mini Mike his gun I think he\\'s gone he doesn\\'t have a chance so let\\'s not talk and he\\'s not in your election anyway so let\\'s forget so many Mike I hear mini Mike by the way has left he\\'s basically given up that\\'s what I hear he gave up he gave up now I hope what I just said keeps him in you know he\\'s the kind of a guy he he\\'ll stay in because I don\\'t want to be wrong Mike it\\'s time to go home go home Mike and enjoy your life go home and spend some money on something so let\\'s just go we\\'ll go because okay do you agree we\\'ll go for the two look Pocahontas we could forget about her [Applause] Pocahontas I came out with that name far too early because those Bernie Amber\\'s they got you know little M\\'s you got soda horrible two people and they said you know she\\'s not done but she\\'s just so damn mean we can\\'t vote for her she\\'s a mean one she is mean so Pocahontas should we leave her in around how about Klobuchar not gonna happen so really we\\'re down to two candidates right sleepy Joe Biden and crazy Bernie so this is appalled I guarantee this as much as they hate me they hate me they\\'ll gonna put this all over the place we have a pall of like 30,000 people inside and out they\\'re doing it outside too we have a poll are you ready who do I so in other words who\\'s the weaker of the two I\\'m not interested in who those better no no I\\'m not interested wait so ready in other words who do I want to run against meaning meaning very simple we put it into nice simple language who the hell is easier to be right so who is easier for us not me for us to be ready crazy Bernie or sleepy Joan I don\\'t know I think maybe crazy Bernie has it a little bit but once more just quick ready Kray he said it doesn\\'t matter you\\'re beautiful I hope so I hope so so who is easier to be crazy birdie or sleepy Joe they think bernie is easier to be they think Bernie\\'s into the pit so whether it\\'s Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private health care Elizabeth Warren\\'s plan I told you that I had more Indian blood in me than her even though I have none I have done zero I have none I have none I said I have more Indian blood in me than she has and she choked she said I\\'m gonna show up in ownership she hired this company and they went out and did a blood test 1024 3 so that means I probably won somewhere down the line a million years ago I\\'m telling you that was horrible she choked we don\\'t want a person to win the chokes we don\\'t want to choke artists right one thing you will say about me I\\'m not a choker with all these people for years they\\'re after me for you can have chokers we can\\'t have chokers as your president so Elizabeth Warren\\'s plan to eliminate America\\'s borders and that\\'s what you or Minnie Mike\\'s plan to eliminate your Second Amendment and take away your guns up many Mike wants to take away you go the insanity of the Democrat Party is wide millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement they are joining our great new Republican Party this November we are going to take back the house we are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House I wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people seriously I wonder what they say they never talk about they\\'ll say Joe Biden had a fabulous crowd today fabulous so fabulous that there\\'s like five people and they\\'ll leave and they\\'ll say President Trump had a smattering of applause s\\'matter they use the word smattering a lot this is not

129 I was with the Prime Minister of India Modi great guy loved by the people of India and we had an amazing thing and I went in and here\\'s the problem this is a big crowd and normally I like talking about my crowds because I get the crowds like nobody but I just got back from a hundred and forty or fifty or sixty thousand people and now I\\'m coming here what is this place hold fifteen it\\'s hard to be enthused you understand that I may never be excited again about a crowd after going to India but they have think of this they have 1.5 billion people we have 350 so we\\'re doing

not doing this but Lindsey is a true fighter for South Carolina loves the estate and as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he said you know that right he\\'s the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee so important so important senator Graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the Constitution Israel and Lindsey was amazing you remember for justice Brett Kavanaugh remember how badly great job Lindsay great job there Thank You senators Scott is a leading superstar he\\'s a superstar but he is a leader in lowering health care costs like nobody has done it you know people don\\'t know but in the last year prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years and that was with no Democrat help if we had their help we could lower it by 50% but we\\'ll get their help one of these days they\\'re gonna get smart senator scott provides world-class care for our veterans what he\\'s done for our veteran veterans is incredible and bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through Opportunity Zones including 135 right here in South Carolina and that\\'s what it is Tim Scott came to my office with an idea he said opportunities and I said to him what the hell is that what is it right Tim and he went through a whole big thing and I said this baby could work and we tried it it is an

Carolina I said if South Carolina is Trump country let me hear you speak [Applause] if you have if you have benefited from the Trump economy let me hear you scream [Applause] okay what what one last thing one last thing one last thing if you want four more years of president [Music] [Applause] well that was quite a display wasn\\'t it now there\\'s a lot of love in this a lot of people said to me friends of mine they\\'re very successful they say how do you speak in front of 25,000 people and 10,000 people and all of this you know why there\\'s such love in the room it\\'s easy no it\\'s true there is such I explained they don\\'t understand it because they\\'re not for doing that but I say there is such unbelievable love in the room that it\\'s easy to do it\\'s sort of easy to do we\\'re all so thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state and as some of you may be know I like this guy for a long time governor Henry McMaster come up and come up representatives Joe Wilson Jeff Duncan William Timmons Ralph Norman Tom Rice and the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party through McKissack [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] and as I introduced somebody and I\\'ll just say stay there cuz he was brave but he got hit hard he\\'s a very special man retired Marine Corps Major General and most of you know he received the Congressional Medal of Honor James E Livingston and James just relax where\\'s Joe he got hit hard thank you James Congressional Medal of Honor winner thank you James they are great brave people you know we have the Congressional Medal of Honor and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom and they\\'re both the highest awards one civilian one is military and I always say getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom is much less painful because when I read them off I\\'ll read like with James or with so many of the Congressional Medal of Honor as many are not living to be honest with you and I\\'ll read stories where one of them recently going up a hill hit 19 times by gunfire grabbing four people bringing him down getting onto a helicopter falling out of the helicopter hitting a tree on the way down hitting a tree they went back and saved him but he died later I mean those are tough deals those are tough deal and we have one right here whose living we have one right here who\\'s living but they are tough so thank you very much for being here and maybe I could ask our governor our great governor of this incredible state to say a few words please Henry [Applause] who is the greatest president in the whole world

country on the face of the earth thank you very much and where\\'s Alan is your son here your great son terney general Alan thank you very much take good care of him okay thank you Thank You Alan and thanks the Republicans all over America we are now working on things that nobody ever thought possible since my election over 121 thousand new jobs have been created right here in South Carolina we\\'ve lifted 10 million people off welfare including 7 million off of food stamps and that\\'s a good thing got a bad thing they\\'re working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they\\'re making much more money and it costs our country nothing we make money they pay taxes it\\'s a whole different deal median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country the unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history about that one that\\'s a good the unemployment rate among African Americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached record lows black youth unemployment has reached an all-time low black poverty levels are the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country for decades Democrat politicians betrayed african-americans they force their children into failing schools they ship their jobs to foreign countries they push their unfair sentencing policies you know about that Alice you know Alice and they favored illegal aliens over their own constituents you know that that\\'s been happening for a long my administration is reversing these failed policies and delivering record games for African Americans we are going to compete for every single vote in 2020 and we expect to win a historic share of the black vote come election day we are supporting working families by fighting paid we got something that nobody thought could happen paid family leave reducing the cost of child care and giving 40 million American families an average of 2200 dollars more in their pockets thanks to the Republican child tax credit Republican not Democrat we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country for years politicians sold you out to global special interests enriching other countries at your expense that ended that ended but I am not the president of the globe I don\\'t want to be the president of the world I am the president of the United States of America last month we finally ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand-new US Mexico Canada agreement into law the u.s. MCA is a tremendous giant beautiful victory for South Carolina farmers ranchers manufacturers all across the state nothing like it what you had to go through with NAFTA everybody was leaving it was a disgrace that was ever signed you know it better than anybody you had those empty hulks all over the all over the country all over this state all around the world we are demanding trade that is fair and my all-time favorite word reciprocal reciprocal got it before after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country we are finally putting America first on Noah\\'s you have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you the American tax they want to treat illegal aliens people that come into our country illegally better than they want to treat our military and our veterans not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury but it threatens innocent lives I recently invited to the White House the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped beaten brutalized and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in New York City here in Charleston County an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade in Berkeley County officers captured a previously deported ms-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire and he should have never been in our country he shouldn\\'t have loud he shouldn\\'t have been allowed [Applause] it\\'s been built [Applause] it\\'s been built and by the way just in case you haven\\'t heard it is being built and that you know and you know they\\'re gonna go nuts they\\'re gonna go nuts they thought they got me you know they said okay have you heard him recently okay he\\'s building the wall and you think it\\'s easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when I have a whole party and a deep state and some never Trump is there a dying breed though the good thing they\\'re on respirator they\\'re on Rose there are mouths to mouth resuscitation you can do it I\\'m not doing it there are mouth-to-mouth resuscitation the never Trump errs but you think it\\'s easy it\\'s not but that\\'s been built but you know what they say now okay he\\'s building the wall but Mexico\\'s not paying for it yes they are I actually they are they are they are paying for and some of the fake news knows that but their reviews are reported but that\\'s okay you\\'ll see you\\'ll see what\\'s going on and I want to thank Mexico because by the way right now they have 27,000 soldiers on our border protecting our border we have Mexico protected and they only do that for Trump they don\\'t do that for sleepy Joe they don\\'t do that for crazy Bernie and they don\\'t do it for mini Mike that\\'s for sure they\\'re only doing that for Trump right only 27,000 soldiers protecting our border in this region of the country alone last year I saw they\\'ve been treated so badly right they are great they\\'re brave they\\'re tough any men two tough guys in here but anybody want to be a nice officer it\\'s tough stuff right they go into those nests they call them nests that\\'s where these guys are together and they knocked the hell I mean if they have to I have to be very careful I don\\'t want to get them in trouble because the press wants us to be very politically correct so so let me change it around they go into a nest of ms-13 and they say oh hello gentlemen how are you and on occasion they have a fight they never lose those fights we need people like that hello gentlemen how are you how many people did you kill last year how many people did you kill last year with a knife because they like knives because it\\'s more painful this is the kind of people that we were letting into our country ice has taken them out of our country by the thousands by the thousand last year ice officers arrested 12 thousand criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and many for a thing called murderer on Wednesday we won the big case in federal court did you see that [Music] we won the case unanimously unanimously federal appeals court where we don\\'t have to give money to sanctuary cities and states if they don\\'t work with us fighting finally finally why should we yet the Democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens they want unfettered catch-and-release we have ended that program it was not easy we have to go through courts everything as a court everything is a suit we do anything we turn to the right they sue as we turn to the left they sue us we win so but we\\'re winning you know that we have 218 judges now it\\'s like good and let me just preface that by saying I know they give fair opinions it bears no relationship to who appoints them but I never win with an Obama appointed judge ever I don\\'t win now we have great judges going on to the courts great judges they\\'re fair judges they\\'re judges that truly love our Constitution [Applause] and their judges that if we feel it\\'s right they don\\'t want to invite the world to trespass across our borders very simple the Democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violent criminal aliens you know that you\\'ve been reading you all you have to do is pick up a paper every day they release these horrible criminals to terrorize their communities we don\\'t do that anymore we won\\'t let it happen and now we don\\'t have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that they\\'re gonna want it\\'s a whole game change and they don\\'t even want to report it I don\\'t know I didn\\'t see much they keep talking about the virus are the viruses Trump doing a good job oh I don\\'t think so I don\\'t think so Chuckie Schumer no I don\\'t think he\\'s sort of good job this guy doesn\\'t know he\\'s alive Oh what bad people Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not for criminal alien thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75 percent since last spring and we have ended catch and release permanently you know what catching releases we catch him we grab them we say could we please have your address address I don\\'t know what the hell is that address they don\\'t have an address could we have a number Java phone could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court so what they do is they catch them they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives and you know it\\'s one of those things in many cases and then release we release them into our country we don\\'t do that anymore and if you knew what it took we catch them and we take some information and we release them in and we say please report back in four years from now for your trial and about two percent come back and they\\'re the ones that are the dumbest people I\\'ve ever seen two percent nobody comes back it\\'s crazy but we\\'re getting it changed and it would be so easy they called loopholes little pulse that word alone they called loopholes it would be so easy if we had some Democrat support we don\\'t have any Democrat support they want open borders they don\\'t care about crime Border Patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year we have deported record numbers of gang members we are building the wall faster than ever and we will soon be building more than one mile a day Washington Democrats have never been more extreme 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders health care takeover they want to take away you health care while the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your health care and to destroy your Social Security that\\'s what\\'s going to happen my administration is protecting your Social Security your Medicare and is fighting to give you great health care and we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice you remember when President Obama would say you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan 28 times he said you can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan while he lied we should impeach him we should impeach him for that he lied 28 times you\\'ll keep your doctor keep your plan it\\'s wonderful Gregg went through the roof we\\'re doing a great job we killed the individual mandate which is the most unbelievable horrible and it\\'s not really Obamacare anymore but we\\'re running the Hulk of it and we\\'re trying to kill it entirely and then we will put it back you\\'ll have great health care and pre-existing conditions will be totally protected pre-existing conditions will be totally protected we\\'re making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office we are now offering plans already that are up to 60% less expensive than the old Obamacare think of that and better and better we are stopping surprised medical billing a disgrace and I signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices which they don\\'t have to do but now they do those same prices fall very very fast we have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as the name-brand drugs but at a tiny fraction of the cost they\\'re just as good I always like a name-brand I mean there\\'s something that there\\'s no difference probably sometimes they\\'re better we\\'ve totally transformed veteran\\'s health care getting long-sword VA choice and VA accountability passed after 50 years and hopefully nobody in this great arena needs it but we have passed something that they said couldn\\'t happen the spectacular right to try you know what that is if you\\'re terminally ill you go all over the world if you have no money you can\\'t you go home and you die you terminally ill they go all over the world if they have money they go to Asia they go to Europe they wanted they\\'re searching we have the greatest doctors in the world the greatest labs and the world greatest technicians in the world and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems and now you sign a piece of paper we\\'re not gonna hold anybody liable you get to use that drug and the results have been unbelievable I\\'m believing hopefully you don\\'t need but now we have right to try they\\'ve been trying for 51 years to get that approved 51 years and we got it approved I guess I\\'m good at getting things approved aren\\'t I those people that I brought up here were the reason to every one of them they were incredible thank you thank you Senators Congressmen they were the reasons we are combating the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly thirty two years and we have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease which is a big deal you know kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because it\\'s so much work they died from overwork it\\'s it\\'s just crazy in theory they could keep them going for a long time but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do and we\\'ve done things that make it so much easier and it\\'s just such an honor to be involved and also Alzheimer\\'s disease we\\'re really making strides it\\'s really a great thing we\\'re pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America\\'s youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing virtually every Democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the very moment of birth that is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God the Democrat Party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your Second Amendment the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American Dream and of course the late great Abraham Lincoln [Applause] Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every walk of life we are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm we are a big tent we are a big party we are the party of big ideas for the future this is where it is this is where is this is not the old Republican Party this is a very inclusive party this is a great party Republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice including right here in South Carolina we want to give school choice to every child in America who needs it from kindergarten to twelfth grade because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school and I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life that\\'s a big deal this could not have been done by anyone but the Republican Party you know they came to me a group of people and they wanted criminal justice reform and I wasn\\'t sure about the issue but we had a lot of great Republicans very much in favor of it including people that happen to be right here today and they were very much and I started studying the issue worked hard on the issue and criminal justice reform you saw Alice Johnson come out of prison 22 years she had another 20 years left think of it for a phone call or a phone call a great woman but we have many people coming out that shouldn\\'t be there for anywhere near those terms not for those terms but they came to see me a group a group of people came Van Jones he came up oh thank you sir if they needed four senators they needed help I called Lindsey I called everybody I called Tim who was so great on everything I called everybody they needed four senators and maybe five and they needed help with some of the ones that weren\\'t moving in the right direction and I gave it to him and I got it and it was not easy and we got criminal justice reform and then I signed it and then this Van Jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all and they say Van Jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform so I called our great first lady over and said darling please take a look it\\'s gonna be so nice because honestly look they couldn\\'t have done even close without being I got all these people together got him done god it was impossible previous presidents couldn\\'t even think about it they couldn\\'t even think about doing it and they tried although I don\\'t think they tried too hard they could have never done it so he gets up and he starts by saying I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton I knew what he was very heavy he looked better when he was heavy hits Joe he\\'s one of the few people he really looked better what he was in he looked much better when he was heavy I gotta tell him I have to explain cuz I know him very well he would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president but he can\\'t admit it on television but he called that he said I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton and then name after name after name of people that I never heard of my wife said are they gonna think about you right are they gonna think about you I said darling of course I said he\\'s saving me till the end because I was by far it\\'s true this is true Tim Lindsay this is true I said he\\'s saving me till the end it\\'s gonna be such an honor to be recognized because I don\\'t get enough publicity I need a little bit more he got to the end and he didn\\'t say it and she looked at me she sort of smiled I think she loved it in a certain way you know but she sort of smiled she said it\\'s too bad I said yes then he said I\\'ve one more thing to say we must get out this year and fight and vote against this President of the United States can you believe it\\'s a two-story Van Jones I mean these are just terrible that they could so I was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady but I\\'ll I\\'ll live through it somehow I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem [Applause] we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights 52 years 52 years the Golan Heights have been fighting and fighting for I did it and I did the true capital Jerusalem right how many presidents promised that every president for many many decades promised we\\'re going to do that they never did it I did it we did a lot we\\'ve invested more than two trillion dollars in the United States military including more than 150 million dollars this year in Joint Base Charleston Fort Jackson and Parris Island [Applause] and we created these six branch of the American armed forces the space force we have another branch 72 years not for 72 years the Air Force have they done a new branch we did the space force you know when I first said if they thought everybody thought I was joking I said I\\'m not joking they thought it was like from the comic strips or the future movies I said no it\\'s all about space in a number of years people are gonna say I can\\'t believe we didn\\'t do this sooner you know we need a little vision we need a little foresight and you know what I mentioned space force and arenas like this it gets one of the biggest hands because that\\'s where it\\'s at that\\'s where it\\'s going unfortunately or fortunately we needed for defense we needed for offer six friends 72 years four years we watched as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of South Carolina at stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation I really believe that it\\'s the survival you see these maniacs that we\\'re dealing with they want to give away everything we will end up being Venezuela large-scale version if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have towards victory in November of 2020 November 3rd to be exactly only this way can we save the America we love and drain the swamp I never thought it was this deep man I talked about a swamp you never told me it was this bad fellas that swamp is bad he got dirty cops at the top of the FBI you got a lot of dirty people but you also have phenomenal people in the FBI and other places but we\\'re draining that swamp I never know is going to be this dirty and we\\'re getting a lot of help from a lot of great people and with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare-to-work dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity this is what\\'s happening think of it from poverty to prosperity look at some of the stories that you have over there look at some of the incredible stories look at Kim Scott look at that incredible story oh really it\\'s a good Lindsay will say it and I give about 99% of the credit to Tim Scott\\'s mother I do I guarantee you Tim there was no games right there was no games in your household it was let\\'s go to work right great mother thank you very much thank you together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system finally of immigration we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer infectious diseases like we\\'re working on right now and ending the AIDS epidemic nobody thought this was possible in less now than nine years that it should have been started before we will end the AIDS epidemic who would have thought we could have done that we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars you have to land on and then you go tomorrow we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms [Applause] and above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true American Way we believe that children should be taught to love our country honor our history and to always respect our great American flag and we live by the words of our national model In God We Trust from Greenville to Columbia and from Myrtle Beach to Hilton Head - right here in Charleston this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth it\\'s true we stand on the shoulders of American patriots who have crossed the oceans blazed the trails settle the continent tame the wilderness dug out the Panama Canal laid down the railroads revolutionized industry liberated millions from poverty hunger and disease one two

Carolina her name is Carolina for a reason this is an incredible time for our nation our country is stronger than ever before and today we just had the largest one-day increase in the stock market in history that\\'s great that was great you know our opponents were said oh maybe he said sure maybe the economy they\\'ll do anything they\\'ll do anything I\\'m sure they were thrilled you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today I don\\'t think by the way look at this look back there look at all of that press I don\\'t know and slippy Joe or Bernie I don\\'t think they have that much press Bernie was going wild why would I be here tonight why would I be here he said why would I be here tonight we don\\'t have the primary we\\'ve already won this thing you know I was going to say that you know what think I said I held it back because they\\'ll say horrible language he used horrible language today but we we\\'re doing fantastically there\\'s never been a time where the Republican Party were so unified as it is now and you know you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Burnie and that\\'s true he does have some enthusiasm but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people - and there\\'s not a lot of enthusiasm for there\\'s not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he\\'s running for the Senate I looked at the first lady I said hey he\\'s running for the Senate and today he just said super Thursday he\\'s looking forward to super Thursday jobs are booming in our country incomes are soaring poverty is plummeting confidence is surging and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military [Applause] and every day for me and for you it\\'s promises made promises kept one of the most important promises I made is right to this era you know we look at it it\\'s the never ending wars in the Middle East we\\'re taking our soldiers we\\'re bringing them back home we\\'re not law enforcement we\\'re bringing it back home American troops cannot be the policemen for the world or to create democracy and other nations that frankly probably don\\'t want it the job of the American military is to secure and defend our country [Applause] two days ago the United States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict and very close to 20 we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home after years of rebuilding foreign nations we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens [Applause] and all of the things that we\\'ve done we\\'ve wiped out terrorists we\\'ve done that so much and you know what we\\'re 8,000 miles away you had a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan you\\'ve got Afghanistan itself the progress that was made was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform you know that and we pay a special tribute and I know you pay it a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice and as we bring back our troops we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place they\\'re not coming here and if they do bad things happen to them we must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country [Applause] by the way I have to say this you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside and somebody was saying that if Pocahontas any one of them sleepy Joe he doesn\\'t have that so it gives a guy vlaka hears very small crowds but if sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd 1/10 the size they go around talking about how big the crowd they never say that hey take your cameras and spin them around this big arena [Applause] [Applause] they don\\'t turn they don\\'t tell you notice they don\\'t turn but if there were some kind of trouble in a little corner anything to make us look bad that camera would turn like a pretzel I used to think you know modern equipment it can turn but would have a protest sir it I must say I\\'ll say it out loud we don\\'t have too many protesters anymore do no fun to be a protester at a trump rally but do we have a great time at a trump rally [Applause] my administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the corona virus you know about this whole thing horrible including sweeping travel restrictions today we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies and they\\'re really working hard and they\\'re working smart and we had some we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies and they could have vaccines I think relatively soon and they\\'re going to have something that makes you better and that\\'s gonna actually take place we think even sooner so it\\'s a lot of good things are happening but we have strong borders and really are tough and early actions have really been proven to be a hundred percent right we went out we\\'re doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country we\\'re working on that very hard we close our borders very early I took a lot of heat for that remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world that took a lot of heat but there are fringe low ballasts who would rather keep our borders open that keep our infection and think of it keep all of the infection let it come in and we\\'re working with other countries in all fairness look it\\'s a problem we\\'re working with other countries remember this over the last long period of time the flu the common flu you know this right from 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected and many people die think of it 27,000 you lose 27,000 people to the common flu it can be much more one year was much higher than the 70,000 number those people died so when you lose 27,000 people a year nobody knew that I didn\\'t know that three four weeks ago I was sitting down I said what do we lose with a regular flu they said about 27,000 minimum goes up to 70 sometimes even eighty one year went up to a hundred thousand people I said nobody told me that nobody knows that so I actually told the pharmaceutical companies you have to do a little bit better job when that vaccine really you have to do a better job on that pass thank you well I ask you is approximately 36,000 people died so we\\'re working hard on it and we\\'re going to come up with some really great solutions in the meantime we\\'re stopping with only in North Carolina oddly enough down that can only be how many people here from South Carolina [Applause] we love both places but that was from North Carolina [Applause] but just to finish up so we made a lot of progress we\\'ve really done a great job with it we\\'re keeping our borders strong my job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first and that\\'s what [Applause] Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals but honestly not so much anymore everyone appreciates these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do we\\'re actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very very big problems so we have our professionals in constant touch I\\'m in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out but the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop we\\'ve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people we\\'re going to safeguard our people the United States [Applause] the United States is right now ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness earlier today when I met with the pharmaceutical companies things were discussed and learned honestly the media didn\\'t know nobody knew they\\'ve never heard this before and we learned a lot and maybe that had the impact on the stock market who knows what happened but we\\'re going to reduce the severity of what\\'s happening the duration of the virus we discussed all of these things we will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible and I have to say with a thriving economy the way it is and the most advanced health system under America is so resilient we know what we\\'re doing we have the greatest people on earth the greatest health system owner we have the greatest health system on earth the renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion no country is better equipped than America to handle new threats and no people are more skilled talented tough or driven than Americans [Applause] and together we are in the midst of the great American comeback that\\'s what it is last month we added 225 thousand new jobs in January alone that makes seven million jobs since the election [Applause] we have destroyed the ISIS territorial Caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of Isis al-baghdadi he is dead and we took out the world\\'s top turns kiss em Soleimani ending his evil reign of terror forever salim haini while the extreme left has been wasting America\\'s time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts we have been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages and lifting up American citizens of every race religion color and Creed tomorrow voters and states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday not super Thursday oh he said Super Thursday you can\\'t do these things can you imagine if I said super Thursday it would be over it would be over no matter how good you are certain things you can\\'t as an example name like sleepy Joe he\\'s constantly naming the wrong state it\\'s great to be in the state of Ohio no no no I\\'m sorry you\\'re in North Carolina no no Joe do you ever see him run up with a sign no no North Carolina Joe once that happens you might as well leave the stage because it\\'s a disaster no matter how good we\\'re in North Carolina it\\'s great to be in Idaho no you\\'re in Iowa now he makes a lot of those mistakes they\\'re a little scary did you see guns you know we\\'re gonna protect your Second Amendment you understand that what did you see sleepy Joe did you see sleepy Joe where he said last year 150 million people were killed by guns in our country 150 million that means 50% of our country that\\'s a big story now a hundred and fifty can you imagine Trump saying that these people would never let me live it down we can\\'t make we can\\'t make even a little mistake right we can\\'t make even a little tiny tiny mistake if we make a tiny mistake as headliner they say things like a hundred and fifty million people killed guns they say super Thursday they say Georgia he\\'s looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow Georgia is not in Super Tuesday so many mistakes you can\\'t do that when you\\'re negotiating with China you can\\'t do that when you negotiate it with these countries can\\'t do those mistakes would be very expensive and then you have mini mic you see this guy can you believe it mini mic he\\'s being interviewed tonight on Fox can you believe it Fox but they want to you know be politically correct they want to interview they end up interviewing more Democrats in Republic\\'s but they\\'re interviewing this guy the night before mini mic hey what a mess he is the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates do we ignore the worst in the history nah you gotta have more and I get down real low but I don\\'t want to copy it everybody saw that everyone\\'s at all you know they all said oh do that again where you get down low but you know if I do that again it\\'s a copy it\\'s a copy No no you never like to copy even though you\\'re copying yourself you don\\'t like to copy you know you do it once I was a big hit but you do it once and you sort of say that was nice don\\'t do it again because if it doesn\\'t work the second time it gets embarrassing right you know right we all know but now he\\'s a disaster waiting to happen he\\'s a mess no matter which Democrat candidate you\\'re talking about and you understand that any one of these candidates and you see what\\'s happening right there all now it\\'s being rigged against it said it\\'s being rigged against crazy burning crazy birdies gonna go crazy crazy I think crazy Bernie\\'s gonna be more crazy when they see what they\\'re doing I called it a long time ago so mayor Pete boot a judge who dead yet mayor Pete he quit out last night and that I hear then I hear a senator from the state we\\'re gonna win we\\'re gonna win that state but she dropped out sounds like they made a deal you know they both supported sleepy Joe there you know why they made a deal you know why quid pro quo that\\'s why okay quid pro quo quid pro quo they made a deal impeach them they should be impeached they should be impeached quid pro quo but they\\'ve embrace an extreme left-wing agenda their plans would massively raise your taxes destroy our Liberty muzzle our faith and erase our sovereignty you know that the Democrat Party has gone crazy whether it\\'s Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private health care Elizabeth Pocahontas is playing by the way she\\'s history she\\'s history I came up with that name far too early I should have just waited but it didn\\'t matter I thought she was making a comeback I said wow I just did it to her but you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago they never caught on in fact she\\'ll probably lose the state of Massachusetts to Bernie so she doesn\\'t know what to do because you\\'re not supposed to lose the state of Massachusetts if you get in there for she\\'s the senator she\\'s the senator from Massachusetts I think she\\'s going to lose it to Bernie and Miss Michigan you see what\\'s going on over there Michigan we\\'re

Bloomberg wants to eliminate your Second Amendment don\\'t worry about it is that gonna happen not gonna happen for him as for Sleepy Jill he doesn\\'t even know where he is what he\\'s doing or what office he\\'s running for actually I don\\'t I honestly don\\'t think he knows what office he\\'s running for and it doesn\\'t matter you know maybe he gets in because he\\'s a little more moderate so maybe he gets in but he\\'s not gonna be running and other people are going to they\\'re gonna put him into a home and other people are gonna be running the country and they\\'re going to be super left radical crazies they\\'re gonna be super left radical crazy Jo\\'s gonna be in a home he\\'ll be watching television and everything will be just fine the insanity of Washington Democrats is why

great job I\\'ll tell you they\\'re looking they\\'re gonna spend a lot of money doing a good job so we do a great job of just an okay job it doesn\\'t matter as long as you win right you know what I did when we won last time somebody else took the convention senators spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom I said what the heck if I win nobody cares and if I if I don\\'t look if you win nobody cares what room you\\'re in if you lose nobody cares what room you\\'re in right so we took a ballroom nice ballroom you know that\\'s it no big deal I figured this way if we win nobody cares and if we lose I\\'m out of there I save a hell of a lot of money but I never thought we were gonna lose that\\'s one of the things they like to spread Trump felt that he wasn\\'t gonna win oh yeah I\\'m running because I thought that\\'s not the deal I mean it\\'s always possible that you don\\'t win but boy I thought we were gonna win and we were getting crowds like this actually to be honest I think our crowds now or bigger stronger and even more enthusiastic it\\'s I really think they\\'re more enthusiastic than ever before and then their true sense you know we\\'re eight months away that\\'s a long time that\\'s sort of like it\\'s it\\'s not even our cuz you know in case you haven\\'t heard we\\'ve got it made in the primaries we\\'ve got it but but you know we\\'re really and for us we\\'re not really even into political season right and we\\'re getting crowds like this we were all over over the last couple of weeks we like to troll we like to go the night before one of their primaries we just we do a little trolling it\\'s called we do a little trolling Bernie Sanders was very upset why would he be there why why because I want to win I want to keep everybody happy yes that\\'s a good reason but honestly we\\'re you know this is when you see this when you\\'re two months or three months out but we\\'re getting numbers that are unbelievable Colorado we went we went to Iowa we every place we\\'ve gone New Hampshire every place we\\'ve gone just came out of South Carolina so that that was an incredible world every place every place that we\\'ve gone up and it\\'s been amazing but also life like to recognize and so important a woman who\\'s really helped us win North Carolina in 2016 and I have a feeling that this year she\\'ll even do better because she happened to grow up here Lehrer Trump and my son Eric talk two great people I mean I have to say that about my son but I know a lot of people don\\'t like this sons that much but Lara has been fantastic and thank you very much what a job she knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here how are we doing Laura how are we doing how we doing in the state are we doing well and we\\'re doing well in Pennsylvania here right and South Carolina I know we\\'re doing great there also with us tonight is a man who\\'s really become a good friend of mine we were going at it a little bit at the beginning but I will tell you and I would say if I didn\\'t get along I would not be here I wouldn\\'t do this I think he\\'s been tremendous he\\'s been a tremendous supporter and things that we\\'ve wanted to do and fights that we\\'ve had which was so important he\\'s been right up and Lindsay will tell you that he\\'s been right up in front and really he deserves another six-year term and probably a lot longer than that but he\\'s going to come up and I\\'m gonna ask Senator Tom Tillis come on up tom has really been incredible he\\'s been working everyday and he really wants to fight the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight take care of our amazing veterans and stop illegal immigration tom is a champion for the people of North Carolina and this November we need everybody to go and vote for Tom he\\'s doing great he\\'s doing great I hear his way up in the polls he\\'s way up in the polls Tom say a few words thank you all again for being here thank you for supporting our president makes sure that I come back for another six years and we get him back for four more years let me tell you about this president I think it\\'s very important since before this president was ever sworn in they were trying to impeach him did he back down no when the media goes after him and trust spread false news or fake news does he back down when he makes a promise does he keep it when he told you he\\'d cut taxes did he do it what he told you would support veterans did he do it when he told you that we would refund the military become the world superpower did he do it when he told you that he was going to confirm superior Supreme Court justices Circuit Court justices and district court judges now 200 of them did he do it yeah and ladies and gentlemen you get a start choice it starts tomorrow we\\'re both on the ballot you need to vote for us so we can go back and do it again but let me tell you again we can\\'t forget what they\\'re promising you on the other side of the aisle Bernie Sanders is so liberal he doesn\\'t even call himself a Democrat he calls himself a socialist this president went to the State of the Union and he said America will never be a socialist country that\\'s another promise he\\'s going to keep now finally ladies and gentlemen I want to thank the president for coming back and I can\\'t wait to welcome into August for the RNC convention but mr. president there was one thing that you said back in the campaign in 2016 it\\'s the only thing I just don\\'t believe that\\'s happened have you gotten tired of winning do you want to win some more then you\\'ve got to give this man we elected so we can give you the free stuff that a free country deserves free markets free trade freedom of religion freedom of speech and the freedom for you to protect yourself with your right to bear arms that\\'s the freedom that this man represents that\\'s the freedom I represent get him elected for four more years [Applause] Wow hey that\\'s pretty good that\\'s pretty good a lot of times we get people up and they just can\\'t do it they start breathing bad they can\\'t breathe Oh help me you know like Bloomberg he goes huh did you see the debate all she came after him she\\'s mean she\\'s very man she came after him and he started choking Oh God Oh get me off this stage Gaby if you guys didn\\'t tell me this was going to happen now that was great Tom we\\'re also honored to be joined tonight by a true American Hero a veteran of World War two and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old and his name is George Washington Perry legit George thank you very much for being here thank you George 100 years old [Applause] he\\'s 100 and he looks good thank you George with the help of everyone here tonight America has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet Earth since my election over two hundred and nineteen thousand new jobs have been created right here in North Carolina we have lifted ten million people off of welfare including seven million people off of food stamps median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded think of that the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history that\\'s that they\\'re the unemployment rate among african-americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history very important to me African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low African American poverty is at the lowest rate ever recorded for decades Democrat politicians betrayed and they truly did they betrayed African Americans my administration is delivering for African Americans like never before no president has done more for our black community no president has done more for our black community and it\\'s an honor to do it last month here in Charlotte we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all Americans it\\'s called opportunity now you know about it we\\'re also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave reducing the cost of child care and giving 40 million American families an average of 2200 dollars thanks to the Republican child tax credit [Applause] though we the Republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did that but the Democrats are saying how did they do that one we\\'re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing in North Carolina you know all about it it\\'s probably the number one reason I\\'m running and the deals were making the trade deals are unbelievable your state lost 43 percent of all manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed think of that weeks ago we finally ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand-new US Mexico Canada agreement into law the u.s. MCA is a giant victory for North Carolina\\'s incredible farmers and factory workers and by the way speaking of farmers and factory workers and small businesses at all for the death tax you know about the death tax right it\\'s called the inheritance tax you have a small farm someplace you have a small business you have a nice business you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax so if you want to leave it to your children you can leave it to your children there\\'s no tax to be paid by your children so they don\\'t have to go back to the evil bank and borrow money from the banker and lose the farm lose the business it won\\'t happen and I always say it because you know I know a lot of parents that don\\'t love their children very much is there anybody in this room that does not love your children please raise your hand please raise your hand nobody nobody that\\'s because we\\'re in North Carolina you love you too now but if you don\\'t that it doesn\\'t matter because if you don\\'t love your children don\\'t leave them a damn thing okay but you don\\'t have the inheritance sex anymore which is great a lot of people don\\'t even know that but that\\'s a big deal or no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people that on the issue of immigration every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens on your tax not only does the legal immigration drain our treasury but it threatens innocent lives as just one heartbreaking example to illegal aliens in Maryland who had been previously charged with attempted murder were released unaccountably released and they went on to murder a teenage girl beating her with a baseball bat and slashing her with a machete the entire Democratic field supports deadly sanctuary cities which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities right here in North Carolina believe it or not the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal who then proceeded to viciously murder a young 19 year old woman last year you know all about it killing her and dumping her body into the woods last year alone sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina how did that happen to North Carolina deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of David and these are really dangerous criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of burglary gun crime sexual assault kidnapping and even murder got to change it your Democrat governor Roy Cooper vetoed a bill that would save North Carolina\\'s lives and banned sanctuary cities in your state what is he thinking but while you\\'re super liberal governor is putting your families at risk your Republican senator Tom Tillis has introduced a bill allowing American victims to sue sanctuary cities for the horrible pain anguish and suffering they inflict on our people [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we\\'re building the wall we\\'re building the wall we\\'re building the wall we\\'re building the wall Mexico\\'s paying for the wall by the way we built a hundred and twenty-seven miles as of today hundred and twenty seven mile and Mexico is paying for the world yeah the media is gonna be thrilled when I explained that Mexico\\'s favor because you know now finally they say I\\'ve had obstruction like you wouldn\\'t believe it the entire Democrat Party I could get anything I created space force I could do anything I could get him but Lindsey and Tom Tillis know this mark knows this all of them know this if I wanted ten cents for the wall they didn\\'t want to get it they didn\\'t want to do it but now we got it and you want it you think that\\'s easy nobody else could have done this we\\'re building it and we\\'re building our hearts away will soon be building many many miles a week but we\\'re up to over a hundred and twenty five I guess one hundred and twenty seven or twenty eight mile of the super-duper wall super-duper I went to border patrol I said what is your wish well sir would likely to be steel and concrete they wanted exactly what they have it and they barriers up top they want everything it\\'s called a no climb provider no climb provider I said what is the word provider mean they didn\\'t know all it means is you\\'re not able to climb over it it\\'s very tough I don\\'t know if you saw in a part of the wall a couple a couple of weeks ago they were climbing the wall and the fire department had to come and take them down they couldn\\'t get that\\'s what that\\'s what the no climb is that\\'s what the no climb is that\\'s a note climb it\\'s more money it\\'s a little more expensive thank you who is that what a voice Pavarotti is cover so we\\'re building the wall that\\'s going great and so they said all right he\\'s building the wall but Mexico\\'s not paying for it yes they are gilsu you\\'ll see you understand some of you understand because I told a few people last weekend it got leaked to the fake news media if you want to end sanctuary cities in North Carolina and across America then you have only one choice you must vote Republican you have to you have to thanks our tireless efforts to secure the border we reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75 percent since last spring we\\'ve ended catch and release one of the worst loopholes you\\'ve ever seen catch and release you catch them you then say where do you live they don\\'t know because look let\\'s face it they don\\'t know and I understand that it\\'s not even to be left at they don\\'t know where do you live Donner don\\'t know Mexico maybe Honduras Guatemala who knows El Salvador where do you live like this guy he\\'s a Mexican you\\'re about as Mexican as I am look at this guy he\\'s as Mexican as I am look at that hat are you Mexican are you Mexican no you\\'re not are you he is it\\'s like Elizabeth Warren she said she was an Indian I said right I said I have more Indian blood in me than you have and I have none and she said oh this is terrible so she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her right 1020 forthright 1000 so I was right I probably have more and me what a phony she is what a phony Washington Democrats have never been more extreme 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders health care takeover while the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your health care in your Social Security and they are going to destroy your Social Security remember they used to say with me I\\'m gonna end it the first day well you know what we\\'re gonna soon be four years and all I\\'ve done is make it stronger you know that my administration is protecting your Social Security your Medicare and is fighting to give you great health care you\\'re going to have great health care we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice remember President Obama you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan 28 times they said impeach him you should have peach him 28 times he lied 28 times he said that 28 times on record you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan well it\\'s not true there wasn\\'t one impeach him we are making health care better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and there better plans we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will and we are trying to terminate in the Supreme Court of the United States the worst health care in the world and we are going to give you the best health care you\\'ve ever seen at a lower price and again protecting pre-existing conditions right protecting pre-existing conditions we\\'re fighting to stop surprise medical building you know what that a surprise you get all sorts of surprises where people they take a blood test in one place it\\'s 26 dollars and in another place it\\'s two thousand dollars same blood test maybe the chief what is better who knows same blood test it\\'s wrong surprise medical building bump out billing I signed an executive order imposing price transparency that\\'s going to be bigger than health care because when providers are required to show their prices those same prices fall very very fast right it\\'s a big thing that\\'s a big thing we\\'ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as name-brand drugs but a fraction of the cost we\\'ve we have given them and there\\'s a lot of political pressure not to do that you can understand why to care for our amazing veterans we passed VA choice and VA account ability and nobody nobody said it could be done so now instead of waiting online for days and days and weeks and weeks to see a doctor you go outside you get a doctor we pay the bill you get all fixed up what a great thing it\\'s called v8 choice I got it done they\\'ve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they haven\\'t been able to and those people over there were a great help we have passed a spectacular right to try you know what that is hopefully nobody in the room needs it hopefully nobody in the room needs right to try we are combating the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years Victor and we\\'ve launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer\\'s and we\\'re pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America\\'s youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing virtually every Democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the very moment of birth how about that that is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God and then you have the governor of Virginia the baby is born the baby is born and he says and then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby this is the governor of Virginia the governor of Virginia he\\'s a beauty remember remember what he did he went to dance like Michael Jackson and his wife stopped him he got lucky but the governor of Virginia wanted to do that the baby is born and then he goes over it talks to the mother the doctor will not talk and you\\'ll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives did you ever hear anything like this the Democrat Party is the party of high taxes high crime unlimited regulations open borders late-term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your Second Amendment the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American dream and the late great

anything today it was like I\\'ve never seen anything like it I\\'ve never seen anything like it you are warriors thank you we had some very bad people outside we had some very bad people outside they were doing bad things but I really do I appreciate it we have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma and I hear I hear from your two great senators in your governor that we\\'re doing very well in Oklahoma that\\'s the work I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before five months from now we\\'re going to defeat Sleepy Joe Biden where does he get a pass from these people huh we\\'re going to stop the radical left we\\'re going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race color religion and Creed Republicans are the party of liberty equality and justice for all we are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order think of what we\\'ve done we will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time that\\'s an all-time record that\\'s its all-time record I\\'ve always heard how important judges are now we know how important they are think of that over 300 around 300 by the end of the term and when we have another four years we\\'re going to have a big big percentage of the total number very important November 3rd and too great Supreme Court judges so we have two justices of the Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch just as Kavanagh they\\'re great they are they\\'re good we have to and we could get a few more we\\'ve spent over two trillion dollars to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States military and all of that incredible equipment whether it\\'s submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters bombers it\\'s all built in the USA we pass VA choice thank you very much Jim what is my Senator Jim Inhofe you better vote for him he\\'s running he\\'s great but we\\'ll get to him and James Langford in a second - great senators you have two great senators so we passed VA choice so if you are a veteran for years and years they\\'ve wanted to do it for almost 50 years we got it done we get a lot of things done and so if you\\'re a veteran and you have to wait in line for one week two weeks three weeks five weeks seven weeks two months what happens is you go outside you get a private doctor you get fixed up and they pay you bill we take care of the bill we take care of the bill and you get immediate service it\\'s never happened before and our approval rating at the VA is now 91% that\\'s how good it is never been anywhere near that done anywhere near that dumpling and VA accountability we had a lot of bad people in the VA people that didn\\'t love our vets people that were sadistic people that stole a lot of bad people you couldn\\'t get rid of them because they were let\\'s say it could be unions it could be civil service right let\\'s say let\\'s just say and so you couldn\\'t get it done that was another one for decades and decades they wanted to get it changed and I got it done with those people and your Congressman the congressman who I\\'m going to introduce VA accountability and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say we say you\\'re fired get out they got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time sort of like me in Washington draining the swamp I never knew it was so deep but it\\'s happening it\\'s happening I never knew it was so deep it\\'s deep and thick get a lot of bad characters thank you we\\'re lowering the price of prescription drugs making our allies pay their fair share they get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals that finally finally after all these years put America first I\\'ve been saying it for a long time we passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country the Democrats want to raise your taxes tell me about that tell me about that I guess I\\'m old-fashioned you know all my life all my life I heard politicians won or lower taxes not raise it if you could lower them you couldn\\'t lose the Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes how do you figure that how do you figure that and regulation cuts we passed more regulation cuts than any Administration in the history of our and with the help of our great energy workers many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma do you ever notice that Weiden no do you ever notice that Biden often times gets a stake wrong he\\'s in Iowa and he says it\\'s good to be in Idaho no no you\\'re not he\\'s in New Hampshire and he says it\\'s great to be in Ohio no no no you\\'re in New Hampshire that happens to all the time has it happened to me yet you know when that happens there\\'s nothing you can do to make up for it you might as well just walk off the stage because the speech isn\\'t just right but we just turned the United States into the dominant energy superpower of the world of the world and because of the Chinese virus what happened about three months ago it looked like we were in big trouble and we were and I got it back together I called Russia I call right I called Russia I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not I called Mexico Mexico was a little bit tough that\\'s called OPEC plus did you ever hear of OPEC plus that\\'s OPEC plus plus and we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel meaning you have an energy business of that almost $40 a barrel couple of months ago it was zero our we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs 10 million jobs so Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and many other states would have been hurt now you think you\\'re gonna be hurt there you try putting aoc in charge of your energy [Applause] that will make the pandemic look like child\\'s play to the people in energy she has one problem it\\'s called petroleum no president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration not even our incredible success in rebuilding America stands in stark contrast to the extremism and destruction and violence of the radical left we just saw it outside you just sort of said you saw these thugs that came along these people call them protesters isn\\'t it beautiful it\\'s so beautiful not if it\\'s so wonderful they call him the Boston Tea Party that\\'s so wonderful yeah they called you ever watch fake do CNN you ever watch [Music] how about the CNN anchor how about the CNN anchor you know did a little shave job in the head which is fun and he\\'s standing in front of a building so including so very peaceful here and the building is it looks like the biggest fire I\\'ve ever seen the whole town is burning it look it\\'s like the biggest fire he said things are very good here Anderson I think it\\'s good I think it\\'s he\\'s a wonderful people and never see that like the world was coming to an end and you know we did something in mini Annapolis after watching for three or four days I called I said you got to get out you can\\'t protect yourselves I got them to take 8000 National Guardsmen and in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem and we did the same thing in other cities but how about Seattle exactly so they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle I mean we\\'re not talking about some little place we\\'re talking about Seattle have you ever been to Seattle they took over a big chunk and the governor whose radical left all of these places I talked about are Democrat you know that every one of them and I\\'d have it offer out I said anytime you want we\\'ll come in we\\'ll straighten it out in one hour or less now I may be wrong but it\\'s probably better for us to just watch that disaster I flew in with some of our great congressmen who were going to introduce in a second and I said to him congressman what do you think I can straighten it out fast you would just go in no sir let it simmer for a little while let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country but Americans have watched left wing radicals burned down buildings loot businesses destroy private property injure hundreds of dedicated police office these police officers they get injured they don\\'t complain they\\'re incredible and injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was and they never talk about coven they don\\'t talk about when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city you never hear them saying they\\'re not wearing their masks you don\\'t hear their say as they\\'re breaking windows and running in and then when I say the looters the anarchists the agitators they say what a terrible thing for a president to say what a terrible thing but you don\\'t hear them talking about covet covet to be specific Kovach 19 that name gets further and further away from China as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus and despite the fact that we I have done a phenomenal job with it I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January which is months earlier than other people would have done it if they would have done it at all I saved hundreds of thousands of lives we don\\'t ever get even a mention then I closed it down to Europe early closed it down because I saw what was happening and by the way most people said don\\'t do it don\\'t do it we saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we\\'re terrible and what we\\'ve done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment and with testing you know testing is a double-edged sword we\\'ve tested now 25 million people it\\'s probably 20 million people more than anybody else Germany\\'s done a lot South Korea\\'s that a lot they call me they say the job you\\'re doing here\\'s the bad part when you test if when you do testing to that extent you\\'re gonna find more people you\\'re gonna find more cases so I said that my people slow the testing down please they test and they test we had tests that people who don\\'t know what\\'s going on we got tests we got another one over here the young men\\'s ten years old he\\'s got the sniffles he\\'ll recover in about 15 minutes that\\'s the case and I\\'m doing that\\'s okay that\\'s the case I was actually with a very nice man very good man even though it\\'s very liberal the Governor of New Jersey right we know now listen he said to me something that\\'s amazing New Jersey was very heavily hit very hard hit thousands of people he said with thousands of people that died thousands of people there was only one person that died under the age of 18 would you believe that which tells me one thing that kids are much stronger than us when you see a little kid running around say boy or boy do you have a great immune system how about a piece of your immune system they don\\'t even know about this let\\'s open the schools please open the schools we got to get them open in the fall we got to get them open the unhinge left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history desecrate our monuments our beautiful monument tear down our statues and punish canceled and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control we\\'re not conforming that\\'s why we\\'re here excellent this cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans they want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place they wanted to fund and dissolve our police departments think of that you know I heard it for the first time two weeks ago I said well that one I mean they\\'re only kidding I said they\\'re wrong did not Minneapolis you see what\\'s going on they\\'re not kidding they got a lot of problems they\\'ll have a lot of problem hey it\\'s one o\\'clock in the morning and a very tough you know I\\'ve used the word on occasion hombre a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do and you call 9-1-1 and they say I\\'m sorry this numbers no longer working by the way you have many cases like that many many many whether it\\'s a young woman on old woman a young man or an old man and you\\'re sleeping so what are you gonna do right so they wanted to fund they really do this is a serious movement and in Minneapolis the council\\'s already passed it in Seattle you see what\\'s going on there it\\'s even worse okay these people are stone cold crazy so if you want to save your hair you want to save that beautiful heritage of us we have a great heritage we\\'re a great country you are so lucky I\\'m president that\\'s all I could [Applause] people have come up to me say how do you take it I say do I have a choice do I have a choice we deal with a lot of bad people but we\\'re winning and every once in a while I\\'ll have one of these days where I\\'m hit left and right left and right like even this great event what if you could have seen that side or if you could have heard the reports the reports oh it\\'s Kovan it\\'s this I\\'ve gotten it\\'s by the way it\\'s a disease without questions has more names than any disease in history I can name come flu I can name 19 different versions of them many call it a virus which it is many call it a flu what difference I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name but they say to be where do you get the energy I say I don\\'t have a choice I don\\'t have a choice you know it was interesting to show you how fake they are you might have seen it so last week they called me and they say sir West Point West Point we\\'re ready I said oh that\\'s right I have to make the commencement speech at West Point you know they delayed it for six weeks because of ghovat so they delayed it and I went there 1106 cadets were graduating and beautiful beautiful kiddo so this just to show you how bad the fake news is so they say to me sure we\\'re ready to go I say let\\'s go this is after saying hello to a lot of cadets inspecting little areas of a building that was very exciting actually it\\'s beautiful very old studied a lot of our great general some of our presidents that went there West Point is beautiful right on the Hudson River but after an hour general that runs it is fantastic guy after an hour we land we do some more inspections and they say sir are you ready yes Sam so we walk like the equivalent of about three blocks which is fine we go on stage which is fine they make speeches that I make a speech at lasted a long time I don\\'t know maybe 45 minutes maybe longer I don\\'t know but a long time the Sun is pouring down on me okay but they said to me before the speech sir would you like to salute each cadet each single cadet or maybe they\\'ll be in groups of two would you like to salute like this yes like this almost 600 times you know what that is 600 times thank God they were in twos cuz let me tell you you do that six hundred times you go home and you say rest it\\'s like a workout without a weight right six hundred times so I did that then the incredible helicopters brand-new gorgeous helicopters the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought so they fly over and the kids throw that Cynthia\\'s beautiful really is it was a beautiful day and we\\'re all finished I was on the stage for hours hours son I came home I had a nice tan meaning meaning I had a nice sunburn his sons gonna write like that but I make this speech right I salute for probably an hour and a half maybe more but around that watch if I\\'m off by two minutes they\\'ll say he exaggerated it was only an hour in 25 minutes he exaggerated he live he lied he\\'s a liar these people are sick to fake [Applause] so then so then I finish saluting my final salute I said thank goodness thank you very much but think of it so essentially almost 600 times now the general says sir are you ready said I\\'m ready general where are we going now kept under said I left early in the morning to get there now it\\'s sort of late in the afternoon a lot of these fakers were with us so they know he said sir we can now leave the stage I say great general let\\'s go I\\'ll follow you and he goes like this right here sir [Music] and the stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long I say general now you gotta understand I have the whole Corps of Cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president I did this big thing I love them I love them they\\'re incredible and they do I said general I\\'ve got myself a problem general because I\\'m wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you walk it on flat surfaces it\\'s not good for ramps and if I fall down look at all those press back there look at [Applause] and this was a steel ramp you all saw it because everybody saw this was a steel ramp it had no handrail it was like an ice skating rink and I said general I have a problem and he didn\\'t understand that at first I said there\\'s no way he understood I just saluted almost 600 times I just made a big speech i sat for other speeches I\\'m being baked I\\'m being baked like a cake I said general there\\'s no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass general I have no railing it\\'s true so I said is there like something else around sir the ramp is ready to go grab me sir grab me I didn\\'t really want to grab him you know why cuz I said that\\'ll be a story too so now I have a choice I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I\\'m rescued or I can go down this really steep really really really it\\'s an ice-skating rink it\\'s brutal so I said general get ready because I may grab you so fast because I can\\'t fall with the fake news watching if I fall if I fall I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane you remember I remember when another president nice man threw up in Japan and they did slow-motion replays right it\\'s true I don\\'t want that general now he\\'s standing there big strong guy and he\\'s got these shoes but they\\'re loaded with a rubber on the bottom because I looked the first thing I did I looked at his shoes then I looked at mine very very slippery so I end up saying okay general let\\'s go I will only grab you if I need you that\\'s not a good story falling would be a disaster it turned out to be worse than anything I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp right so so what happens is I start the journey inch by inch right and I was really bent over - I didn\\'t like that you know I didn\\'t like this picture this picture of jewel will be an ad by the fakers so I was bent over and then we finally reached almost the end and that fake news the most dishonest human beings they cut it off you know why because when I was 10 feet short I said general I\\'m sorry I\\'m at and I ran down the rest right I look very handsome that that was the only good I wouldn\\'t want to run down the whole thing because the fool there would be definitely bad so I took these little steps I ran down the last ten and by the way there tape take a look in almost every instance it ends just before I run and they said he was the number one trending story I called my wife I said how good was that speech I thought it was a hey look I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones like so far tonight I\\'m average oh heavens so far tonight but I called my wife and I said how good was it darling she said you\\'re trending number one I said to our great first lady I said let me ask you a question was it that good the speech that I\\'m trending number one because I felt it was really good no no they don\\'t need to mention the speech they mentioned the fact that you may have Parkinson\\'s disease it\\'s true it\\'s true [Applause] they say there\\'s something wrong with our president I\\'ll let you know if there\\'s something wrong okay I\\'ll let you know if there\\'s something I\\'ll tell you what there\\'s something wrong with Biden that I could so then my wife said well it wasn\\'t only the ramp did you have water I said yeah I was speaking for a long time I didn\\'t want to drink it but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit you know you\\'re drinking for you working hard up there with the Sun pouring down on you I love this location the sun\\'s like this this way they save on lighting right that\\'s why they did it probably so what happens as I said what does it have to do with water they said you couldn\\'t lift your hand up to your mouth with water I said I just saluted six hundred times and this was before I saluted so what\\'s the problem she said well I know what you did you had on a very good red tie that\\'s just sort of expensive its silk because they should they look better they have a better Sheen to them and I don\\'t want to get water on the time and I don\\'t want to drink much so lift it up the water I see we have a little glass of water where the hell did this water come from where did it come from and I look down on my tie because I\\'ve done it I\\'ve taken water and it spills down India tight this is look good for a long time and frankly the tie is never the same so I put it up to my lip and understand because I know what it\\'s artistic ate and they gave me another disease they gave me another disease anyway that\\'s a long story but here\\'s the story I have lived with more the ramp than the water but I\\'ve lived with the ramp in the water since I left West Point not one media group said I made a good speech or I made a great speech but the kids loved it because they broke their barrier which wasn\\'t good in terms of kovat but they broke their barrier and they wanted to shake hands they wanted and I don\\'t want to tell anybody but there are a couple of kids they put up in I actually shook their hand okay I actually shook them because they were excited they were excited that with their president they were excited the most beautiful young people men women the most beautiful young people you\\'ve ever seen so think of how you feel give me I go there how did I do sir that was a great speech you know all my people sir that was one of your best that was great I say that\\'s great I agree it was a good speech I like that speech they don\\'t mention the speech but they have been going down this ramp at an inch attempt it\\'s so unfair it really so unfair they are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth they\\'re bad people okay that\\'s enough of that I wanted to tell that story does everybody understand that song the left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson now we\\'re getting into the rails [Music] they decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus except in New York when the Italians surrounded it they didn\\'t have too much of a chance those Italians I love the Italians they heard they were gonna rip down there beautiful Christopher Columbus or all of a sudden they circled that thing they didn\\'t do too well in hurting Christopher did they thank you to our Italian population we\\'re very proud of two days ago leftist radicals in Portland Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington [Applause] and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire Democrat them all Democrat everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something mister senators we have two great senators we ought to come up with legislation that if you burned the American flag you go to jail for one year one year Jim and James Jim engines we ought to do it you know they talk about freedom of speech and I\\'m a big believer in freedom of speech but that\\'s desecration that\\'s a terrible thing they do we used to have things so we don\\'t have them anymore because we want to be so open so everything and look what happens we should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it but just burn it they go to jail for one year okay in Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat City Council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist map these are anarchists these are not protests as you listen to the fake news they say the protesters were lovely could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right try to take over Seattle they\\'d have machine guns out to get them but these people can take over the city look at what they\\'ve done to business people that are spent years and years building their business and now they\\'re wiped out take it away governor Inslee ought to get his act together get in there I\\'ll help you I\\'ll do whatever you want I\\'m waiting for a call I would love to do it I would love to do it it\\'ll take it\\'ll take less than an hour and it\\'ll all be over with and you\\'ll have your city back and yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation Joe Biden is surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob he has no control does anybody honestly think he controls these radical maniacs you know what he says to his wife when he\\'s not confusing her with his sister get me the hell out of here these people are crazy that\\'s what he says he has absolutely no control you know a lot of times I\\'ll make like a speech and I\\'ll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech beautiful brilliant but Joe didn\\'t and it\\'ll say a comment from Joe Biden but he didn\\'t say it professional people great students in English Lit people that are very smart said Joe Biden said and they\\'re going to this highly complex paragraph beautifully worded and I say Joe didn\\'t say that Joe doesn\\'t even understand it and Abidin his election he will surrender your country to these mobsters a hundred percent your 401ks by the way look at how we\\'re doing in the stock market just said another record with that stack master your 401 k\\'s and money itself will be worthless your 401 k\\'s are doing very well unless i don\\'t want to say if you were stupid I said don\\'t sell don\\'t sell it went down but we got it back up and now NASA think of it Nasdaq just set a record and I think you\\'re gonna see a lot of records and next year if we don\\'t do anything stupid on November 3rd you are gonna have the greatest economic year we\\'ve ever had that\\'ll be next if the Democrats gained power then the riders will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control Joe Biden is not the leader of his party Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left and he\\'s not radical left I don\\'t think he knows what he is anymore but he was never radical left but he\\'s controlled by the radical left and now he\\'s really controlled his campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters looters and arsonists who ravaged Minneapolis they bailed them out they put up a lot of money to bail them out the rioters and looters and they were they were the arsonist so they\\'ll say oh it\\'s terrible what he says about the people of our nation maybe some of them aren\\'t even from our nation the left is trying to do everything they can to stop us every hour of every day including even violence and mayhem they\\'ll do anything they can to stop us look what happened tonight look at what happened tonight law enforcement said sir they can\\'t have they can\\'t be outside it\\'s too dangerous we had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city the mayor and the governor did a great job but they were very violent people and our people are not nearly as violent but if they ever were it would be a terrible terrible day for the other side because I know our people I know our people but we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation what they did tonight I saw it on television coming in on Air Force One one thing about Air Force one we got plenty of televisions we have televisions and closets he opened up the closet got a television we got a lot of televisions it\\'s a great play and great everything by the way we ordered new ones no president wanted to do it they thought it was luxury I said wait a minute Air Force one is 31 years old people don\\'t realize that so I said they gave me a chart very early in my administration like how about the first week sir would you sign for this plane now it\\'s actually two planes would you sign for this plane Air Force one I said how old is the original or the one we have now search 31 32 years and I\\'d see people coming in from foreign lands that can\\'t compete with us rich countries but they can\\'t compete with you and they have a brand-new beautiful 747 800 747 and I said wait a minute that country has new and we have a 31-year so somebody had to do so the deal was made and it was made for a lot of money I think it was five point seven or five point six billion dollars now in all fairness it\\'s two planes and there\\'s a lot of stuff in those planes I won\\'t talk to you about it so I told Boeing the head of Boeing they said sir please would like to get started on the planes I said I do too but I\\'m not paying five point six billion and I\\'m not paying four point six billion I said it has to have a three on the front of it and that\\'s a hell of a lot of money too but it is a rather complex situation they said no way no way this was before Boeing had problems by the way but Boeing\\'s coming back they\\'re coming back the greatest company in the world and it had some big problem it had a couple of problems that didn\\'t work out that was terrible but the greatest I think before that it was the greatest company in the world it made up 1/4 1/4 of a point of our GDP think how big that is one company it was an unbelievable machine and then they made a plane and they did some foolish things and a terrible thing happened and all of a sudden they\\'ve gone through hell but you know what they\\'re coming back we\\'re ready to help them if they need it but they\\'re coming back and they\\'re coming but this was the Boeing before that and they were riding high and like I was before this thing came in but we\\'re still riding high because you know what on November 3rd we\\'re gonna win so they came in and they came in and they said no no no we want no week 5.6 million whatever was whatever it was if I\\'m a little bit off they\\'ll go crazy you know whatever but it was a lot 5.6 million nope gotta have a three got ever three called me up nope cancel the contract I said cancel the contract I want to cancel I said general can you cancel the contract he said yes sir were proud of it oh good cancel it okay sir by the way to cancel it do you have to pay anything yes sir we have a cancellation fee sir how much is it general two hundred and fifty million dollars sir I said what sir we made a good deal two hundred and fifty million to Kent you mean if we don\\'t buy the plane we have to hand them 250 million that\\'s not good right take a look at these two guys they\\'re looking by the way that\\'s like a good story compared to some I could tell you like with aircraft carriers so they said 250 million or I always say this or around that number because I\\'m off by a little bit they say oh he exaggerated sigh I look at numbers all day long that\\'s what I look at for years now for my whole life when you think of it 250 million cancellation fee sir he was very proud of himself what a great day I say general don\\'t cancel don\\'t cancel just tell him I don\\'t want the planes don\\'t put anything in writing don\\'t put it in writing general why Sir because I don\\'t want to pay 250 so hear that Jim Jim Inhofe he\\'s great you hear that Jim you know that story he does a great job so here\\'s what happened - bottom line Boeing says no way no way no way the next week they say no way we\\'re doing it the next week they said how about five billion I said no way no way the next week they said 4.8 I said nope it\\'s got to have a three on the front of it don\\'t you understand you dumb son of a bitch don\\'t you I turned out to be right you know turned out to be right nobody gets set no gotta have a three next day they come back four point five is our best offer nope I\\'m not doing it I\\'m not doing it just come back when you\\'re ready a month goes by another month they never heard about it they never heard from me they thought I was serious I was and they came back at four billion dollars that\\'s a lot of money but I saved like a billion six or a billion seven nobody wants to talk about when I get foreign nations to pay us of billions and billions of dollars nobody wants to talk about that when I take soldiers out of countries because they\\'re not treating us properly Germany is an example I mean I have a German heritage like some of you I said let\\'s get it down from fifty thousand twenty-five thousand because they\\'re delinquent for many years that delinquent they haven\\'t been paying what they\\'re supposed to be paying they\\'re paying one percent on set of 2 percent and 2 percent is a very low number and they say yes we think by 2030 maybe 2030 - we could get current I said no Angela Angela please don\\'t say that uncle ah wait it\\'s true you know who I\\'m talking about nice by the way very nice well I\\'m a very good negotiator I said Angela that\\'s a long time this was in 2019 she said 2032 I said no longer that\\'s not working but I said what about because now they want to get current but I said well what about the last 25 years all the money you always everybody forgot about that they forget about all the money that wasn\\'t paid I said what about the trillion dollars that you really owe so we\\'re negotiating let\\'s see but in the meantime we\\'re reducing our troops remember this remember this we\\'re supposed to protect Germany from Russia but Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for energy coming from a pipeline brand-new pipeline so they pay the country we\\'re supposed to protect them from they pay billions of dollars to that country we\\'re supposed to protect them excuse me how does that work how does that work [Music] and the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Ted James Lankford likewise when they just said they love you James when they hear it they get it a lot of people don\\'t get it they get it we cannot continue to be ripped off we\\'re ripped off by so many countries and we\\'re stopping it and that means that a lot of people don\\'t want me here they don\\'t want me there are a lot of people that don\\'t want me you know they don\\'t sell a lot of bombs when we\\'re not dropping bombs on people you know that right it\\'s called the military-industrial complex when rioting and looting broke out in our nation\\'s capitol I very quickly deployed the National Guard I said get him in after watching for an evening or two we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets and last night they had a little breakout again they ripped down a statue that was a hundred and ten years old beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with a radical left mayor watching on television we\\'re not happy that\\'s going to be very expensive for DC they\\'re always looking for money we need more money we always need more money and then they don\\'t do the proper job so it\\'s not gonna be good for mayor Bowser mayor Bowser they were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great beautiful Jefferson Memorial not gonna happen don\\'t worry about it we have it surrounded with very strong people the choice in 220 is very simple do you want to bow before the left-wing mob or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans and explain this to the NFL I like the NFL I like Roger Goodell but I didn\\'t like what he said a week ago I said where did that come from in the middle of the summer nobody\\'s even asking we will never kneel to our National Anthem or our great American flag we will stand proud and we will stand tall I thought we won that battle with the NFL their stadiums were emptying out did you see those stadiums took him a long time to get you back a lot of people didn\\'t like that you know a lot of people that you wouldn\\'t even think would care that much I\\'ve had people that I said these are super left liberals and they didn\\'t like it Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church but not for burning a church [Applause] they believe you can riot vandalize and destroy but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-america rally they want to punish your thought but not their violent crimes they want to abolish bail abolish and open up your borders they want open borders let everyone and by the way we\\'re doing so well we have a record this month on the borders nobody\\'s coming down very few and they want to abolish ice our great people from ice who send the roughest toughest meanest people that you\\'ve ever seen or ever heard generally speaking when they have lots of tattoos on their face they\\'re not looking to do you much help ice they\\'re rough guys they\\'re rough they\\'re great Americans in love but they\\'re walking take off in a pack that walk into a pack of tough ms-13 gang members and you know we shouldn\\'t say this it\\'s not nice they want us to negotiate they start swinging and the other starts where everybody\\'s swinging at the end they carry him back and they throw them into the paddy wagon right there great and these people want to get rid of ice they get rid of murderers they get rid of rapists they get rid of the worst scum on earth and when I called them animals I said they\\'re animals and Nancy Pelosi they cut up a young woman they cut up a young woman and her friend cut him up with a knife because it was more painful dead cut him up with a knife because it\\'s more painful takes longer than shooting a gun they cut him up I said these are animals and Nancy Pelosi said these are human beings are not animals if I lose an election over that you know what this country\\'s in big trouble big trouble they wanted this on law-abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious ms-13 gang members in Joe Biden\\'s America rioters looters and criminal aliens have more rights than law-abiding citizens and that\\'s true in my administration we defend American citizens and we deport ms-13 members or put them in jail if we have to the chaos you\\'re seeing in our democratic run cities these are all run by the Democrats is what will happen in every city and community in America and much much worse if we don\\'t keep them out we have to do this we have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest you know what to do you know what to do gotta keep the White House Joe Biden\\'s record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal calamity and failure he never did anything he was a senator he was a vice president he was before that something guy you know it\\'s great President Trump was tough on this or he was too they complain never did anything about he\\'s been there for 43 years of 47 years he never did anything about it Biden supported every globalist attack on the American worker let\\'s make every country of the world rich but ourselves including NAFTA the disaster of NAFTA he wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry Korea I renegotiated the deal I took a horrible deal that was a Hillary Clinton special I was a Hillary Clinton special she said we have to make this deal with South Korea it\\'s going to mean 250,000 jobs and she was right for South Korea 250,000 and China\\'s entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden that was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country when China joined the World Trade Organization they became they were flatlined for decades they became like a rocket ship he voted for the war in Iraq he voted for mass amnesty for illegal alien he supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants and immigration enforcement and require he wants to require you to provide free health care for millions and millions of illegal aliens okay when I took earlier decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus and as I said Joe Biden opposed my decisions and called it hysteria xenophobia he does know what the word means in a phobia and fear-mongering and then he apologized a month later he said he was wrong but he didn\\'t say it and they didn\\'t cover it they didn\\'t come on one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime Joe Biden sided with China over America that\\'s closing the border he thought it was a terrible thing remember this was all this was in January that\\'s early real early the end of January he thought it was a terrible thing when we closed the border to many people that were badly infected with covet when the chips are down Biden will always cave to the radical left he\\'ll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that Joe Biden will always let you down that\\'s been his history at my direction early this year the heroes of the US military took out the world\\'s top terrorists the savage killer and leader of Isis al Baghdadi and the number one terrorist anywhere in the world Qasim Sola matey we took him out Joe Biden opposed killing Salome knee he was very mentally we killed this number one terrorist he didn\\'t like it you know why he didn\\'t like it because he thought it would be good politically that didn\\'t work out too well just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden he opposed it you know that Biden is always on the wrong side of history as said by people that are with him and worked with him he never made a correct foreign policy decision Biden is a puppet for China son walked out with 1.5 billion I think it\\'s a little bit allowing them to rip off America for many years now they\\'re paying those billions and billions of dollars we give a lot of it to our farmers we have plenty left over John is not exactly happy with me [Applause] billions they pay us billions and billions of dollars and they targeted our great farmers and I took the money that they targeted I took that money and I gave it to the farmers so they were even so they\\'re ok are you ok come doctor plays doctor thank you these people I mean some of the people are waiting for five days especially in this location right you take your time darling take your time thank you very much take your time doctor thank you doctor [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] now some people wait for four or five days that\\'s incredible he never did anything against China Joe Budden and that\\'s why they desperately want him to win they want him to win so badly Iran wants him to win so badly let me tell you I\\'m gonna make a very fast deal the best deal you\\'ve ever seen I\\'ve already made one with China but I can make even more they want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose Iran President Obama gave them 150 billion dollars for nothing and almost Lauren credibly he gave them 1.8 billion in green cash beautiful care and now they\\'re not doing so well are they they\\'re not doing so well someday we\\'re going to get credit for this someday but they are waiting Iran wants to make a deal so badly but they\\'re told by Kerry and all these other they shouldn\\'t the Logan Act but they\\'re told by Kerry and all these people wait because if Trump loses you\\'ll own America you\\'re gonna own it they\\'ll say you own it so I don\\'t mind I told them we can wait but when I win you\\'re gonna pay a much higher price than if you made a deal and look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where Sons paid eighty-three thousand a month and he was jobless give me a break eighty-three thousand a month more than anybody if Joe Biden were to become president and emboldened left will launch a full-scale assault on American life you know that they\\'ll expel anyone who disagrees with them look what happens when you disagree you use a term that\\'s perfect and they\\'re not happy with it they call you a racist they call you a horrible person they want to crush religious liberty they don\\'t want religion silenced religious believers indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country subsidized late-term abortion and after birth execution they want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment as sure as you\\'re sitting there in fact he even put the big gun grabber baito Iraq who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president they put him in charge of guns lots of luck on your Second Amendment just remember I said and hopefully you won\\'t have to think back about it too much because it won\\'t matter hopefully it won\\'t matter no bait oh Iraq who wants to give up guns is in charge of the Second Amendment the damage will also eliminate private health insurance banned fracking that\\'s not good an American energy will be in a position of weakness like it\\'s never been before and that\\'s after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far and they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterated and you now see how important the Supreme Court is think if we didn\\'t have two justices that I think have been very very very good but think how important it is think how important it is and we still I guess it\\'s I don\\'t know if it\\'s an equal Court it\\'s almost like we\\'re a minority court right it\\'s almost like we\\'re a minority called the recent Supreme Court cases proof that if Joe Biden is elected he will stack the court with extremists and two forgotten men and women together with everyone else this\\'s will lose everything - forgotten men and women I campaigned on the Forgotten these are great people these are substantial people these are the elite by the way you\\'re the elite they\\'re not the elite somebody two days ago said sir the elite are really working hard or trying to destroy you I said yeah why do you call them the elite I said why well I\\'ll just been did not elite I look better than them much more handsome [Applause] got better hair than they do I\\'ve got nicer properties I got nicer house I got nicer apartments I got nicer everything I ran for politics once just once in my life and I became president of the United this man and hopefully if you get out and vote we\\'ll do it one more time we won\\'t even tour with them about three or four more times we want it we\\'ll do it one more time we\\'ll be two for two and our country will never ever be stronger but I\\'ll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court and I\\'ll choose only from that list a hundred percent probably 25 incredible people any one of which could be a great justice any one of which and I did it last time and people loved one I did it and I\\'ll only pick from that list Biden can\\'t release his list because the names would be too extreme too radical they wouldn\\'t be acceptable but they will be very radical people people don\\'t understand but we actually won on docker yesterday we actually won because they basically said you won but you have to come back and redo it it\\'s almost like gee come on back your paperwork was no good but we\\'re gonna be refiling but don\\'t let it get you everything\\'s gonna work out really good it was a great it was great I mean he would have been nice if we wanted everybody said oh you\\'re gonna win doc you\\'re gonna win doc that\\'s Jeezy\\'s got to win doc that\\'s easy they all said it and they came back and they said we don\\'t like what you did with your paperwork essentially right so we\\'re refiling it most people would say oh we lost we didn\\'t lose we\\'re gonna refile it and everything is gonna work out for the young people most of whom aren\\'t so young anymore by the way but we\\'re gonna work it out for everybody Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party he is their pawn he doesn\\'t even know where the hell he is let\\'s face it he installed socialist Alexandria or calcium Cortes to be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy energy you can forget petroleum how does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free not good right our country will have no energy our country will have nothing Oklahoma Texas North Dakota and many others will all be out of business I don\\'t think that\\'s gonna work out too well but she\\'s actually in charge of environmental policy and you know what that means she does even want wind she does if she doesn\\'t want those bird killing machines that go round and round you want to see a lot of birds that are dead go under a windmill sometime she wants us to go back to the stone Age\\'s because she\\'s got no sense no credentials she\\'s got a little charisma not much but she doesn\\'t have a clue you know it but she\\'s in charge of the environment no aeroplanes we can forget Boeing I guess come to think of it right we talked about Boeing we can forget Boeing let\\'s cancel those brand-new Air Force ones right likewise representative Jihan Ilan Omar ilan Oman is going to be very much involved in a Biden government they will put this hate-filled America bashing socialist front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country I don\\'t think so she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came Somalia no government no safety no police no nothing just anarchy and now she\\'s telling us how to run our country no thank you and I think I think we\\'re gonna have a big victory in the state of Minnesota because they\\'ve had it they\\'ve had Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism when Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago remember I used to call him 1% you know he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap but he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician even ripping off the man\\'s personal biography and family history and claiming it was ozone he forgot to say he was born in America Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite since 2003 he is delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral and at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation including a former member of the KKK and yet Biden is now smearing his racists tens of millions of people like yourselves decent hardworking Americans who he\\'s never met and he frankly probably doesn\\'t want to meet America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden sleepy Joe a man who praised in partner with segregationist shipped millions of black American jobs overseas and everyone else\\'s jobs - by the way if I didn\\'t come along we\\'re building auto plants we\\'re building everything and there\\'s never been a comeback like we\\'re making right now never been he hollowed out our middle class including our black middle class with open borders trapped young children and failing government schools built cages those cages were built by Obama and Biden look it up 2014 and the fake news as I wanted to remember the picture of a cage a cage for children remember the picture of the cage and they said President Trump and then they realized that was in a newspaper 2014 the same built by Obama and Biden the cages and they don\\'t want to report the way it is they know the way it is they\\'re not stupid they sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumbled help the big banks while hammering community leaders and made our cities less safe and secure for all they\\'ve done a terrible job and they shouldn\\'t be awarded they should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd that shouldn\\'t happen it\\'ll destroy this country our country will be destroyed we\\'ve all worked too hard they don\\'t know what the hell they\\'re doing some do actually but in a very sinister way virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century Joe Biden is supported or enacted I\\'ve done more for the black community in four years then Joe Biden has done in 47 racial justice begins with Joe Biden\\'s retirement from public life we are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders these are great

you and they are just incredible talented tough strong people that love you state a lot so thank you very much so we built the greatest single economy in the world and then we say not only the world but actually in the history of the world then they never even challenged me so I guess I\\'m right we did it we had the best numbers anybody\\'s ever had with the best employment numbers African American Hispanic American Asian American the best employment numbers in history the best stock market numbers finis we were the envy of the world everybody would come in to see me presidents Prime Minister kings queens and dictators dictators would even come in there say congratulations on the economy and then the plague came in and now what we\\'re doing is we\\'re doing it again and it\\'s going fast we have to have a lot of it done because people don\\'t quite get it it\\'s whip doing record business it\\'s happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe two weeks ago job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country last week last week retail sales numbers came in retail sales the single greatest number in the history of our country so here\\'s what\\'s going to happen here\\'s what\\'s going to happen they blame a president for anything when you see looters even though we put him down if we didn\\'t stop him nobody would because the other side will never stop but they always blame a president here\\'s what\\'s happening we\\'re going up we\\'re going up we\\'re going up we\\'re gonna go up then we\\'ll get a hit October we\\'re gonna be up we\\'re gonna be way up we\\'re not gonna be where we were but in many ways other than all of the horrible horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated which was China but we\\'re going to go up up up up August September October and people are gonna say man this guy\\'s doing a good job he knows what he\\'s doing I don\\'t believe the fake news anymore and you\\'re not gonna want to lose your 401ks and you\\'re not gonna want to lose all of that wealth that you\\'ve accumulated whether it\\'s real estate wealth or any wealth you can think of it\\'ll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge and if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes it\\'ll be a whole different ball game so I\\'m not putting any pressure on anybody but in the end we\\'re gonna have a phenomenal economy and next year we\\'re gonna have a good third quarter but next year and I said it before we\\'ll be the single greatest year economically that we\\'ve ever had okay and if you see that happening if you see it happening on November 3rd you don\\'t have the guts to vote against Trump you even you you don\\'t have the guts to vote against Joe say wait a minute darlin my 401k is higher than it was the last time I don\\'t think I want to take a chance you\\'re not gonna want to do that the stock market has been the best think of this go back one week and go back fifty days in that 50-day period it\\'s the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market picker and your wife or your husband says darling I love you so much you are such a great investor and all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time right darling I love you so much you\\'ve always been a loser you\\'ve always lost money but now under President Trump you\\'re one of the greatest financial minds in our country and all you did was keep your stuff now if you think you\\'re gonna run again so they get it they\\'re going crazy they they want the stock market to go down even if it costs them money they want the stock market to go down even if it costs some money and they don\\'t even know why you know what they\\'re smart and they\\'re vicious but they don\\'t know why I\\'m telling you they don\\'t know why what\\'s wrong with having the strongest military brand-new in the world all Bentley what\\'s wrong with having these great economic numbers what\\'s wrong with having to close it down we saved millions of lives you know a lot of people say we should have got heard let\\'s go hurt ask him how they doing in Brazil he\\'s a great friend of mine not good you heard about Sweden right too much ask him how they do it in Sweden we saved millions of lives and now it\\'s time to open up get back to work okay I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and university we slash regulations and pass massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they\\'ve never ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses and I work closely with a great senator also friend of theirs senator Tim Scott South Carolina to create opportunities owns which are doing incredibly and since then countless jobs and 100 billion dollars of new investment not government investment have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country 9,000 never happened before Tim Scott today I\\'m also announcing that I have directed secretary of the Interior David Bernard to place the John Hope Franklin reconciliation park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network so many of my friends have been asking me to do so many of my friends including these great politicians so we\\'re going to do that it\\'ll be done very quickly we will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools jobs housing justice and crime in major city public schools run by Democrats over two-thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math and I think the numbers are worse than that but Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve then allow them to attend the charter public private religious or independent schools of their choice pro-choice stro choice pro-choice fiscals it\\'s very popular but some people it\\'s like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats even though they know it\\'s wrong Republicans believe access to education is a civil right it\\'s a civil right 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats think of that 20 of 20 and so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that\\'s over 30% they\\'re controlled by Democrats we can name every one of them the murder rate in Baltimore in Detroit is higher than El Salvador Guatemala or even Afghanistan how they doing the Democrats running those cities your whole country will be like that in 2018 alone our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter 25,000 people for rape and nearly 1.5 million for assault violent assault the Democrats push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you\\'d never believe thousands of innocent lives will be lost as president I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement a vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools better jobs safer families and stronger communities for all Americans there is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years with your help we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity that\\'s what\\'s happening that\\'s what\\'s happening and that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they\\'d see it was happening before this covet came in it was happening at a level that nobody believed possible and then China sent us the plague thank you very much we will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors and will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always always we will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written we will end deadly sanctuary cities we will finish the wall which has now 212 miles built and beautiful 212 mile that\\'s a lot of mile and let me tell you think that was an easy one now is a tough one that party was totally unified against building the wall you know in the end they gave up you know what happened they realized it was a bad issue for them because they these open borders I love oh I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas there\\'s something wrong with those people so did you notice in the end it was like just leave us alone

to disgrace it\\'s a disgrace if we weren\\'t here you could forget it okay but we\\'re gonna be here and then you\\'re gonna be here we\\'re gonna keep it going for a long time November 3rd is a big day get out get the parents get the friends get the husband get the weight get everybody now the difference is they get everybody even if they\\'re not registered if they\\'re not citizens if they\\'re here illegally they get everybody that\\'s one of the little difficulties and you know you go through a whole nation and you see what\\'s going on and they report zero in legality check out California sometime check out now check out the the deal that they signed with judicial was it was I think Judicial Watch was like 1 million oh 1.5 million people they settled they agreed that that many people either voted illegally shouldn\\'t have been voting a lot of things they settled and Judicial Watch said look we were so high what difference did it make what difference that are big no will they play a very dirty game you\\'re fighting against an oppressive left-wing ideology that is driven by hate and seeks to purge all dissent and you understand that amazing at that age your young people generally couple of old stirs out their friends among the radical left demands absolute conformity from every professor researcher reporter journalist corporation entertainer politician campus speaker and private citizen but we have Charlie and we have our people and our people is stronger our people are stronger and our people are smarter and we are the elite we are there you know you ever notice they said it two weeks ago I was talking to some missus well you know the elite I said what are you talking about the elite who\\'s the only Debbie Lee they\\'re not they\\'ll leave you dearly you\\'re smarter you\\'re better looking have a better future you know your way around it better believe it or not there\\'s only one thing they have they\\'re more vicious they are vicious they are vicious people anyone who descents from their orthodoxy must be punished canceled or banished that includes from television you say it but you will not be silenced and you know the bottom line I get interviewed by people and I\\'m sitting the other day and the Oval Office and I didn\\'t like the tone and I said you know it\\'s really nice because I\\'m here and you\\'re not [Applause] the over and I\\'ve said it before you\\'re the courageous warriors standing in the way of what they want to do and their goals and standing up for faith and family God country and freedom freedom [Applause] unbelievable spirit I appreciate it thank you very much but the radical left they hate our history they hate our values and they hate everything we prized as Americans and we\\'re right because our country didn\\'t grow great with them it grew great with you and your thought process and your ideology the left-wing mob is trying to demolish our heritage so they could replace it with a new repressive regime that they alone control they\\'re tearing down statues desecrating monuments and purging dissenters it\\'s not the behavior of a peaceful political movement it\\'s the behavior of totalitarians and tyrants and people that don\\'t love our country they don\\'t love our country the left is not trying to promote justice or equality or lift up the downtrodden they have one goal the pursuit of their own political power for whatever reason but that\\'s their goal that really seems to be their goal their goal or their sickness and if you give power to people that demolish monuments and attack churches and seize city streets and set fire to buildings then nothing is sacred and no one is safe we stopped them last night you see that interjection [Applause] and brought some to jail and others are going to jail the problem we have is states they\\'re weak they\\'re weak the many of the governor\\'s many of the mayors you see what\\'s going on and it\\'s by the way just so you understand it\\'s all Liberal Democrat states could you imagine if sleepy Joe ever became president this country would be a mess they would rip down everything everything sleepy Joe and he wouldn\\'t call the shots well he would have nothing to do with it a lock him in the Oval Office let\\'s just do what we want to do that\\'s why and you know today he\\'s with Obama President Obama it only took him how long a year and a half to endorse him what did it take a year and a half to endorse him even after he won he didn\\'t endorse him for a long time and he\\'s fighting he\\'s fighting for sleepy Joe you know he really feels strongly about it so strongly that he was fighting he wanted everybody to win but Joe Joe won but if you remember in my campaign he fought harder than crooked Hillary President Obama fought me harder he said you cannot let him win you cannot dis you he was all over the place I said this guy\\'s spending all of his time campaigning against me who won that\\'s right [Applause] and don\\'t forget don\\'t forget I\\'m only here because of him and Biden I\\'m only here because of them because if they did a good job we wouldn\\'t have been here there would have been no reason so I\\'m only here because of President Obama and the job he did and sleepy Joe Biden and the job that he didn\\'t do other than he did a good job for his son a good job no but I\\'m only here because of them otherwise I wouldn\\'t be people were very unhappy the fake news isn\\'t reported they were very unhappy there was tremendous dissent tremendous anger a lot of people in this audience I can tell you but we\\'re here today to declare that we will never cave to the left wing and the left wing intolerance [Applause] we will never surrender to mob violence and we will uphold American freedom equality and justice for every citizen of every background very strong that\\'s who we are that is what we believe and that is why we must prevail on November 3rd we have to prevail

sales numbers the biggest ever number and we\\'re gonna have a very good third quarter and interesting we\\'re gonna have a good third quarter and right when those numbers are announced you have your election so that\\'s hopefully a sign from up there but I think we\\'re gonna give and they are trying to do their best to keep the country shut down and closed because they love those numbers not to

what good shakes he said you gonna store and he\\'s walking and those good and he had lots of gold gold and those satchels didn\\'t they huh cuz I\\'ll tell ya we caught him let\\'s see what happens but we caught him right we caught and a friend of mine that did a great job is the NASA CFO and you see we\\'ve totally rebuilt NASA we\\'re sending Rockets up now for the first time Jeff to win Jeff the way Jeff everyone in this room is bound together by a shared set of moral principles and enduring truths we believe the United States of America is the greatest and most righteous nation that has ever existed gonna keep it that way we believe that every citizen has the fundamental right to think to speak to live and pray according to their own conscience we believe that the beloved heroes of American history should not be torn down by militant mobs but held up as an example to the world now thereafter George Washington I said what did he do wrong George Washington Thomas Jefferson we stopped them they were heading toward the Jefferson Memorial they have they couldn\\'t care less I think half of them don\\'t even know who Thomas Jefferson is how about Ulysses Grant they want the Confederate soldiers but all of a sudden they go after Grant but he\\'s the one that defeated the Confederate soldiers so what\\'s that all about how about Gandhi how about Churchill you know Churchill because this is going outside of our country now no we\\'ll stop it don\\'t worry you still worry about it ten years is a long time to spend in prison [Applause] so our heroes are not a source of shame they are an example and something that you can all look up to a true example of greatness a point of pride and we will honor them and cherish them forever we will cherish them and we have to cherish our past we have to cherish good or bad we have to understand our past we have to understand our history because if we don\\'t know our history it could all happen again after Norwich [Applause] we believe in law and order we support the men and women of law enforcement and we stand with the citizens in every city and every community and every part of our country who wish to live in safety security dignity and peace [Applause] and we know that American patriots don\\'t bow down to foreign powers we don\\'t back down from left-wing bullies and the only Authority we worship is our God [Applause] these are the values our country was built upon these are the values that unite our citizens and these are the values that powered our civilization to its towering heights lifting billions from poverty healing disease curing illness and reaching new summits of scientific endeavor artistic triumph and human achievement guided by these timeless convictions my administration has been delivering historic gains for the American people [Applause] like no one has ever done in the first three and a half years of a presidency not even close it\\'s not even close by the end of my first term we will have close to 300 federal judges appointed in a pro 300 if you get 10 it\\'s a lot 300 an old-time record and very importantly we confirm two great Supreme Court justices and we have to win because obviously we need more justices on the Supreme Court people don\\'t realize how important that is I\\'ve always heard it\\'s the most important thing you can do I always said defense but that\\'s right there Supreme Court justices and judges and we are setting records we\\'ve spent over two trillion dollars to completely rebuild the awesome power of the United States military and I very proudly created the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces the space force good deal that\\'s a victory that\\'s a figure you think it\\'s just that if you did just that that\\'s like that\\'s a good president think of then that\\'s one of many many things we\\'ll go over a few of them but many many things so the Air Force was the last one there was 75 years ago the Air Force 75 years ago we just created another branch we\\'re gonna have a general a nice general we have right now on the Joint Chiefs of Staff for full full deal and that\\'s a great honor because space is going to be very important first they smiled when I came up with the idea I never talked about it on the campaign I don\\'t think I ever mentioned it once it\\'s just an idea that I learned as I was going through military and really an amazing thing space is gonna be so important that\\'ll be one of our most important of all and it\\'s an honor we\\'re now doing a Hydra sonic I called super duper z\\' missile goes 17 times faster than the fastest missile right [Applause] we passed VA choice a big deal and VA accountability a big deal they\\'ve been trying for 50 years almost 50 years on both accountability they couldn\\'t fire people that treated our vets badly now we can say you\\'re fired oh by the way you had a big deal that\\'s right that\\'s right you had a big deal in Arizona I\\'ve been reading about it for years now Doug where they had somebody stealing in the VA and they caught him cold like 500,000 right that\\'s a lock they stole five hundred thousand they couldn\\'t fire him they couldn\\'t fire him so between the unions and civil service and all of the things they couldn\\'t fire but we made it so that you can now say you fired get out and they\\'ll give our veterans the care they so richly deserve you know choice is so big instead of waiting for a week two weeks five weeks you have no idea how bad it was if they have to wait and they have great doctors we have great doctors in the VA if you have to wait if for any reason there\\'s a delay you go outside you get a doctor you get fixed up we pay the bill and it sounds expensive it\\'s cheap it\\'s cheap we save money most implement we save lives people would get online and they\\'re okay not feeling well by the time they see a doctor in some cases they check its terminal II they they are terminally ill it would take weeks and weeks and now we have VA choice that\\'s why you see good store is 91% approval rating okay 91% va va choice nobody thought we were going to get that one done we passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms and we passed the largest number of regulation cuts by a factor of many times no other administration even though in some cases eight years and in one case more nobody has cut regulation like we\\'ve cut regulation not even close and it\\'s one of the reasons we did so well before the plague and we\\'re doing so well after the plague it\\'s going away we eliminated Obama cares unfair individual mandate [Applause] which punish young Americans like you for the privilege of not buying bad health insurance that\\'s really what it was he had the privilege of not buying and you had to pay for it not too good so we got rid of it that was a big deal that was one of the most unpopular things anywhere on any subject we will always protect people with pre-existing conditions and you have Martha\\'s pledge that she is going to do that also so we\\'re gonna do that and the Democrats can\\'t make that pledge because they\\'re gonna raise your taxes like crazy I never heard you know all my life I think Doug can maybe explain it but Doug all my life I\\'d watch and the best politicians they want to cut taxes not raise taxes all of a sudden we\\'re in an age where things are very different let\\'s face it ripping down statues one of the things as the Democrats want to raise your taxes to a level that nobody can even believe and it won\\'t be nearly enough to pay for what they want to do you talk about bad health care it\\'s just gonna be a disaster but they want to raise everybody\\'s taxes I always thought it was supposed to be the other way right but let\\'s see how they do on November 3rd I don\\'t think they\\'re gonna do - well we passed right to try to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures so they don\\'t have to travel all around the world and see if they can find and we\\'ve had tremendous success with that right to try very proud of it they\\'ve been trying to get that one done for 40 years and I\\'ve just come from the Arizona border Yuma where we marked the completion of over 220 miles of brand-new beautiful border wall [Applause] you know you don\\'t hear about though they don\\'t want to talk about the wall letting would you notice never has the Democrat Party fought so hard against something and do you notice they never talk about the wall because in the end they gave it up they give up we won we\\'re building it fully funded I could build numerous walls with all the money I had fully funded but you know why that I\\'ll talk about it cuz it\\'s a bad subject remember the use of a it\\'s a it\\'s obsolete we weren\\'t drones oh great the drones flying around we\\'re gonna watch everyone pour into our country the drone remember they said the walls obsolete and I said today nobody heard it I thought it was sort of I think I said it but I\\'m sure if people have said it over the years you know you\\'re in an industry in many cases you have a computer in about two weeks it\\'s old it\\'s absolutely right in technology I said to some of the people I meet them all I say the problem with your business it gets obsolete quick to things that will never be obsolete a wheel and a wall right a wheel and they say that wall is obsolete with modern technology no no mana technologies like let\\'s watch everybody pour it now we have a wall so we\\'ve built 220 miles we\\'re going to have and it\\'s every single element I met with Border Patrol who a fantastic by the way every single element they want it you have to see through which makes sense you have to do all of the different we have cameras on it we have sensors on it it is just too a 30 feet high it\\'s very hard very hard we have anti-crime provision on the top we have the whole deal and it\\'s very powerful and by the way where that wall is nobody\\'s getting through nobody [Applause] we put a chunk California off the record California would say please can we have the walk this is California you know if they didn\\'t want the world they don\\'t want the wall but they wanted the wall right because right next to San Diego\\'s a wonderful town in Mexico you know the town I won\\'t mention the name but they\\'re heavily infected with kovat debe notice I said the other night did anybody see my speech the other night on Saturday that what I said the other night there\\'s never been anything where they have so many names I could give you 19 or 20 names for that right it\\'s got all different names wuhan go hannes was catching on coronavirus right Kong flu country Kovac Kovac 19 Kovac I say what\\'s the 19 Kovac 19 some people can\\'t explain what the 19 give me the Kovac 19 I said that\\'s an odd name I could give you a many many names some people call it the Chinese flu the China flu right they call it the China as opposed to chat the China I\\'ve never said anything like it but here\\'s the story we are going to be stronger than ever before and it\\'s gonna be soon and I think you\\'ll remember you know now Biden\\'s going around like he\\'s a tough guy you know he doesn\\'t know where the hell he is weird where are you Joe Joe where are you jump tell me where you are Joe but he\\'s going around I stood up for China no his son walked out with 1.5 billion to manage and what he did where\\'s hard to remember I said where\\'s hunter they came out with this t-shirt and some guy made a fortune where\\'s hunt where\\'s that by the way where is hunter man he did well as vice president could you imagine how Hunter\\'s gonna do if this guy ever won and the father could honestly say I have no idea what\\'s going on the grazers so Kaley where\\'s Kate where\\'s Kaylee where\\'s Kaylee where\\'s bar Kelly what a job she\\'s done our press secretary [Applause] everyone\\'s doing well up press record at least press secretary I mean Sarah is gonna be the governor of Arkansas pretty soon I hope Shawn\\'s got his own show in this one here she could run whatever else you wanted but I said don\\'t run don\\'t run just stay here we like the job you do now we\\'re doing great I stood up to China like no other administration in history for decades they\\'ve ripped us off they ripped us off like nobody and I charge them a little thing called the massive tariffs we took in billions and billions of dollars they devalued their currency and you know they like to say our people paid oh no no our people didn\\'t pay they devalued their currency in order to pay it and they also put money out there otherwise they wouldn\\'t have been able to sell their product but what happened for many years there is nobody ever that ripped off the United States like China nobody nobody nobody so now we did a deal but you know the ink wasn\\'t dry when the when the plague flew in the ink wasn\\'t dry the deal was great everybody was happy I was thrilled 250 billion dollars worth of purchases over a short period of time all great but the ink wasn\\'t dry and we got hit by the plague so I\\'m not too happy about that but the long slow surrender is over because today and every day we are putting now America first America comes first [Applause] we sparked a revolution in domestic energy production in the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on planet earth America as of a couple of years ago is no longer energy dependent we are now energy dominant and because our energy used went down so much during this pandemic it was a very very bad period of time because we have ten million jobs energy jobs and now we have the oil press up where it should be and yet people are paying very little for gasoline that\\'s like the perfect thing right that\\'s the perfect thing to do and I signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform which nobody was able to get done very important [Applause] very important I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities nobody goes [Applause] and we created opportunities owns along with Tim Scott and since then countless jobs and 100 billion dollars of new investment have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods in the country nine thousand opportunities run so think of it I did criminal justice reform we did a lot of work on prison or prison reform we did Opportunity Zones think of this think of all we\\'ve done and we\\'ve taken care of the black colleges and universities and nobody talks about it but I have to talk about it and you know what [Applause] our black communities know it and I think you\\'re gonna see something really great happened because they understand it they really understand it and I\\'ll tell you what whether it\\'s any community you talk about but if you take a look at those numbers from pre virus but you take a look at them in a year from now you watch and your 401 s right now your 401 KS I don\\'t think you want to have somebody else playing with them because you\\'re just about at a record high and you put the wrong person in they will be obliterated they will be obliterated so we\\'re fighting for school choice because we know that access to education is a civil right the civil right school choice [Applause] but you ever see two parties so diametrically opposed to each other I mean it\\'s who can be opposed to that but it\\'s so important but the Democrats will never ever allow that to happen last month we returned American astronauts to space aboard American Rockets for the first time in nearly a decade and the United States will be the first nation to plant our beautiful American flag on planet Mars [Applause] and we destroyed we destroyed 100% of the ISIS territorial Caliphate and the savage terrorist monsters al-baghdadi and Kasim Salome nee they are both dead hundred percent hundred percent of the Isis Caliphate er when I took over that Caliphate was gold like this it was a mess but we destroyed it no administration has accomplished more in just three and a half years it is I mean I could go after those are just a few points I could talk for an hour and a half just reading the points off you know that yet as you know in recent months America is face down that unseen enemy the virus from the distant land that spread across the globe and invaded our shores but invaded the shores of think of it 88 188 Nations I have a friend he\\'s a very smart guy said I didn\\'t know there were that many nations I said actually go over 200 but 188 nations that we know of I love you too thank you [Applause] thank you and tomorrow the fake news will be said he said he loves somebody he said he loves somebody terrible [Applause] terrible I\\'ll be a big trouble the fakers they are terrible people who are the two who the people that stood up I just was set up Liz who said I love you that\\'s whoa [Applause] sit down fast please don\\'t let them see you that\\'s a lot of press back there look at that that\\'s the problem they cover all these speeches you know I never have a speech done I never have a speech where it\\'s not like live television you know sometimes you\\'ll have one way you can actually speak and you don\\'t have to worry about like one little slip one tiny little slip one word you could say ten speeches one little word they\\'ll say he\\'s lost it no you know who\\'s lost it sleepy Joe has lost [Applause] in response we took swift and early action to ban travel from China very very early remember Nancy Pelosi and that crazy group Nancy Pelosi she wanted to dance in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco long after I banned China from coming here we saved tens of thousands of lives with that early decision and then we made an early decision on Europe yet liberal lawmakers and Democrat politicians condemned this policy the left rejected science in favor of their fanatical devotion to open borders they want open borders not just our southern border this is why the left is so dangerous they always put their ideology before your safety it\\'s crazy what\\'s going on defund and abolish the police how is that a good idea [Music] you know I passed a set I was in the White House and there was this set and it had dem say think of it defund in abolish I said what are they gonna do fun no I said it says defund and abolish I said what what are they gonna do fund and abolish I thought was gonna be something they said the police I said all great I just won the election that\\'s [Applause] so in addition to issuing a series of aggressive travel bans my administration launched the greatest national mobilization since World War two we have done such a great job with this between the ventilators and all of these things including testing we\\'re testing so much we\\'re now up to twenty seven point five million tests I thought it was 25% seemed like 25 million 27 they just told me twenty-seven point five million tests now when you have all those tests you have more cases so the news cover said they have more cases well yeah if you\\'re gonna do 20 and if let\\'s say other countries - 1 million 2 million big countries 3 million now 4 weeks ago Germany was a 3 million test so I don\\'t know what they are now but I know they\\'re not anywhere near where we are so then they\\'ll say we have more cases now look we want to do testing we want to do everything but they use it to make us look bad but because of it our mortality rate is so low it\\'s so great what\\'s happening so we want to tell so we do all these tests and we find pockets that we find people and we find cases and they say the cases have jumped instead of saying what a job we\\'re doing with testing but we did the job with testing and we did ventilators and we did we came up with tests that nobodies we have so many different types of tests we have the five-minute test the 10 minute says we have tests you send them to a public lab but privately we have tests it\\'s a lot of tests and other countries that have done very well with testing they call us they say there\\'s nobody that\\'s been able to do the job with that you\\'ve done now the only ones I can\\'t get to say that are the fake news media people they can\\'t say someday it\\'ll be recognized by history someday but our actions in your selfless sacrifice and that\\'s what it was saved hundreds of thousands of lives we had to do it and we did the right thing and I\\'ll tell you what we did the right thing now we opened we got to get it open because you know I said gotta get it open people needed you know people get sick from the other also it\\'s not just from the virus that gets sick from all of the other things that happen you know what I mean we cut through red tape to accelerate breakthrough therapies and vaccines we\\'re gonna have a vaccine very soon we distributed 1.5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment we unleashed the medical and logistical power of the United States military and thanks to our efforts not a single American who needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator that\\'s impossible [Applause] remember when the New York governor Governor Cuomo said he needs 40,000 ventilators though people said no no you need 4,000 maybe 5,000 anyway we got him what we thought was right they never needed all of them in fact they gave some to other people but he didn\\'t need 40 40,000 as opposed to 4,000 or 5,000 then it worked out great then he wanted a hospital built in the Javits Convention Center we built it but he didn\\'t use it he could have used it for the older people it was brand-new not infected no infection then he wanted the boat he wanted the boat to come up the beautiful beautiful hospital ship you know what that is called right and it came up they could have used it for senior citizens they didn\\'t use it and it\\'s a shame it\\'s a shame it\\'s a shame we\\'re now the chief ventilator producer anywhere in the world we\\'re helping other countries with ventilators because ventilators are very hard to make they\\'re very complex that bacon expensive and many countries are calling us asking for help they need ventilators and were able to do it because we\\'re making thousands of ventilators think of the thousands of ventilators a week and to rescue the US economy which is happening now we pass over three trillion dollars in relief measures we suspended student loan payments and interest for college students and to protect jobs for young Americans just like you we took historic action to block the entry of foreign workers into our nation and we believe that companies should hire American workers and American students first they have to have we got to go American we got to go man you know we were down to three point four three point five percent unemployment and that\\'s one thing but now we got to get it back to those numbers then we can think right that we can think about taking people in through merit only through merit or mostly through a merit I better say mostly because they\\'ll say that\\'s a terrible thing you know you can\\'t make a little bit of a slip they\\'ll say he said only what about this what about that generally speaking we like merit we want American students to fill American jobs that\\'s the biggest difference between us and the left we know that our first duty is to take care of our citizens make America great again [Applause] so before the play came in we had the best of everything we had the best interest rates we had the best unemployment rates we had the best job numbers ever we had everything unemployment for african-americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans had all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country it\\'s amazing how many categories young people young people without a high school diploma young people without a college diploma we were number one on every list you can think of women 75 years not as good I\\'m sorry but it was getting ready to hit the all-time women it was the best in 75 years so I have to apologize could you believe that we did the best in 75 years and I apologize to women but we were ready to hit the all-time and then we got hit by something that should have never happened because they could have stopped it young people had seen their wages rise by more than ten percent they\\'ve never seen anything like that we built the strongest and most prosperous economy in the history of the world and we will do it again very very quickly it\\'s happening already we\\'ve just added two and a half million jobs last month think of that that\\'s the largest increase in the history of our country two and a half million jobs in one month and just to add the topping as I mentioned the 18% in retail sales the surge was the biggest jump ever recorded in this Shiva country the stock market in the last 50 days is the best stock market in history and went up today again by the way think of that think of that go back a week fifty days the strongest fifty days in stock market history this is during hopefully the end of the pandemic but as we fight to restore renew and rebuild our country the hard left is trying to divide denigrate and destroy our country the American people have watched in horror as left-wing extremists have looted businesses violently assaulted innocent civilians and brutally injured hundreds and hundreds of police officers are great police officers they even vandalize that\\'s right the Lincoln Memorial the Lincoln Memorial [Music] [Applause] [Music] the radical left thinks the future belongs to them no the future belongs to you it belongs to people that love our country so we\\'re not going to take borrow lectures from the same left-wing ideologues who oppose school choice who support deadly sanctuary cities who wanted to fund our police to fund an abolish our police think of it the funded abolish is now their theme and who preside over the violence and mayhem of the 20 most dangerous cities in America 24 20 20 most dangerous run by Democrats and it\\'ll happen to our country if a guy like Joe Biden gets in because Joe Biden has no control over what\\'s happening they won\\'t even be talking to him the murder rate in Detroit and Baltimore is higher than that of El Salvador Guatemala or Afghanistan but the left launches know protests over these travesties the travesties because it doesn\\'t serve their radical agenda think of that tougher than Afghanistan all run by Democrats while their movement is based on hate ours is based on love love of our family love of our nation and love of our fellow citizens [Applause] we embrace the noble vision of Reverend Martin Luther King jr. and believe that people should not be judged based on the color of their skin but the content of their character [Applause] this is a choice of two futures the left\\'s vision of disunity and discord or our vision of equal opportunity and equal justice every American should take a long look at the bedlam in Seattle because that\\'s exactly what we\\'ll come to every city near you every suburb and community in America if the radical left Democrats are put in charge they want to abolish ice do you have any idea how patriotic ice people are I know they are very tough I agree they\\'re very tough I agree they like to fight I agree but you don\\'t want to do it look I\\'m looking at some pretty tough guys right here look you\\'re not gonna do it he\\'s not going into a into an ms-13 nest swinging swinging now these guys are tough they\\'re smart they\\'re getting them out by the thousands that take in ms-13 out of our country by the thousands they want to polish ice get rid of ice abolish bail they want no bad anymore just you know we put you in for murder it\\'s okay come back whenever you have a chance you see what\\'s going on in some places like Philadelphia what\\'s happening in Philadelphia what\\'s happening in other cities look at what\\'s going on in Chicago what\\'s that all about Chicago is a great city but they want to abolish borders and abolish every Police Department in the country the Democrats are also trying to rig the election by sending out tens of millions of mail-in ballots using the China virus as the excuse for allowing people not to go to the polls say we have a virus coming we have to send think of it California he\\'s gonna be sending out millions and millions of ballast well where are they going were these ballots going who\\'s getting them who is not getting them little section that\\'s Republican will they be stolen from mailboxes as they get put in by the mailman will they be taken from the mailman and the mail women will they be forged who is signing them who\\'s signing them what are they signed at a kitchen table and sent in will they be counterfeited by groups inside our nation will they be counterfeited maybe by the millions by foreign powers who don\\'t want to see Trump win because nobody has been tougher on trade or making our country great again nobody know mail-in ballots is a disaster for our country it\\'s gonna end up in a big fight you know look look just just forget about all of this stuff forget about speeches and teleprompters and all of that they send out millions of ballots who\\'s getting them how are they delivered who\\'s not getting them think of it it\\'s gonna be fraud all over the place and if you look right now if you look right now look at all of the disputes to having on mail-in ballots a friend of mine it was a great guy had a son who passed away seven years ago seven years ago he came to see me the other day he said they just sent to my son Robert a mail-in ballot he died seven years ago there\\'s no way they can control that with mail-in ballots you introduce something in the middle of an election year and you have something where it\\'s very complex you have no time to fix this very complex process it\\'s very complex this will be in my opinion the most corrupt election in the history of our country and we cannot let this happen they wanted to happen so far [Applause] we believe in the sacred principle of one person one vote and that\\'s why we are fighting for the integrity of our elections absentee ballots are fine absentee ballots are fine like I live in the White House and if I can\\'t get to Florida or you live wherever you live you can\\'t but you have to go through a process some people just can\\'t make it to a polling station and they have good reason but they have to go through this process in order to verify their identity people went to the polls and voted during World War one they went to the polls and voted during World War two we can safely go to the polls and vote during kovat nineteen [Applause] and there\\'s tremendous evidence of fraud whenever you have mail-in ballots and frankly if we are really going to protect your elections and some people don\\'t want to hear this we must have voter ID [Applause] so as long as I\\'m president America will be a land of fair laws swift justice and Safe Communities and that\\'s why when rioting and looting broke out in our nation\\'s capital I quickly deplore I came in I deployed the National Guard very quickly mark meadows was there with a lot of our people there we stopped the violence we saved that incredible statue you saw last night and restored peace and order to the streets although I will tell you they did great damage to the cannons that were on the ground they did great damage but we\\'ll get them fixed we\\'ll get them fixed lock them up yeah lock them up it\\'s incredible how they can do it credible where they did damage we\\'re lucky we just got there in time you saw the ropes going up we got there just and I\\'ll tell you law enforcement did a great job they rushed him they rushed [Applause] and these people fought back and the law enforcement was much tougher much sharper much better they really had no trouble handling him it was like handling a baby for them was just like a baby a lot of spoiled people in that group you know a lot of spoiled lot of spoiled rich people saying what are you doing here I\\'ve also made clear that any rioters damaging federal property and defacing our monuments will face severe and lengthy criminal penalties ten years [Applause] many of the young people here today have had your own encounters with left-wing extremists such as an tyfa joining us today are two students from north carolina state university great place great state Chris Thomas and Jack Bishop please come on up fellas come on [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how are you guys thanks awesome listen thank you so much mr. president it\\'s great to be out here in Phoenix this is the first time I\\'ve ever been here and I\\'ve gotta say it\\'s been the experience of a lifetime and listen I\\'m going to keep this short and sweet I just want to say that conservative censorship on campus is real and it\\'s happening all across the country all the time this past year at NC State we were having a event for NC State and we were posting ads advertisements in our free expression tunnel where you\\'re allowed to paint whatever you want we were making some advertisements and we had about 20 socialist thugs roll up from an tyfa and from the young democratic socialists of america now now for our trouble of course they rolled up and attacked us and they started spraying all over the work that we had just done and for my trouble of I stood the line and tried my best to to control keep them from from defacing our ads and for my trouble I was spray-painting in the eye and unsurprisingly of course the school did nothing there\\'s a surprise [Music] and they let aunt Eva run roughshod over our event they let them in the in the room with us they were protesting screaming so loud that you could barely hear the speaker\\'s the entire time and of course NC State like many administration\\'s across the country does the will of the radical left meanwhile conservatives across the country are punished and blacklisted merely for expressing our own opinions we\\'re ostracized and ousted with no support whatsoever from the administration but let me tell you when administration\\'s across the country do the will of the left of the left and cater to the mob it\\'s our duty as conservatives to stand up and to fight for our rights and to fight for our nation and to fight for our guy [Applause] and you know mr. president mr. president my dad congressman Dan bishop he likes to say that you like to say that he\\'s not a choker and let me tell you mr. president us college conservatives we ain\\'t chokers neither we\\'re gonna win this election we\\'re gonna take back the house we\\'re gonna keep the Senate and we\\'re gonna get four more years of the Brest presidency of my lifetime the presidency of Donald J Trump thank you god bless you and God bless the United States of America mr. president thank you so much isn\\'t honored to be here with you today thank you for giving attention to our situation when the mainstream media back there wouldn\\'t touch the story conservatives across this country are treated different every day by their professors and other students on campus I was mocked by a leftist on my campus not for my conservative beliefs but for a medical condition I have it impacts my hair growth and my ability to sweat I\\'ll learn that when these leftist ideas fail they resort the personal attacks because they have no facts to back up their radical beliefs imagine how much of a fit the mainstream media would have thrown at 15 to 20 kids and mega hats had come up and spray-painted a kid in the eye and made some of someone else fear a medical condition they have our school North Carolina\\'s state did not do anything about this they didn\\'t discipline them and it was no coincidence that the antifoam logo showed up on the free expression tunnel the next day [Music] we are blessed to have a president like you that is devoted to protecting free speech on college campuses and Thank You president trove and students for Trump let\\'s keep America great [Applause] great job fellas thank you so you know I signed an executive order as you know and based on what I\\'m just hearing you should maybe be talking to Charlie or somebody around here about defunding that school because that\\'s that\\'s exactly what the executive order was based on so you talked to the people maybe have your father calls father\\'s a great congressman done a great job so say hello to him but you talked to them that\\'s exactly what it was for we did something that was radical but it wasn\\'t radical to me you have to be heard if you can\\'t be heard let\\'s talk about it okay as the radical left inflict violence on American streets they\\'re also waging war on timeless American values like freedom of speech which is what we\\'re just talking about anyone who dares to speak the truth is canceled censored the platform to fired expelled harassed abused boycotted deprived of a livelihood or even physically assaulted those times will be changing very soon you can judge a movement by its behavior and the young Patriots here today don\\'t destroy property you don\\'t burn buildings you don\\'t punish the centers and you don\\'t try to erase the people with whom you disagree it\\'s called civilized people you civilize people and yet remember I said this you\\'re civilized but you\\'re much tougher than the other side you much time you conduct yourselves with honor integrity and dignity because you know the truth the facts and the history all on your side we\\'re joined today by Reagan miss Cora a student at Northwestern State University of Louisiana Reagan became a target of liberal cancel culture when she dared to stand up for a Christian values instead of bowing to political correctness Reagan please come up and say a few words [Applause] well thank you mr. president for being here today with all of us and for inviting me up here to tell of my experience with canceled culture my name is Reagan Eska day I graduated from Northwestern State University of Louisiana in 2019 and I started my first job at a small private insurance company in Louisiana a few weeks ago amidst all this chaos that we\\'re seeing with the black lives matter movement I made a video on my Instagram and I talked about how disappointed I am in the church\\'s reaction to the black lives matter movement I\\'ve seen pastors call for white congregants to kneel and to apologize and to apologize for the skin that God gave them and I and I addressed these evangelical pastors and leaders and and reminded them that racism is a problem in the heart it is a sin problem that cannot be resolved by any law protest or March and so of course my leftist followers didn\\'t appreciate this message at all I had my name blasted all over social media and people told me you know I\\'m ashamed to have ever called you my friend I\\'ve lost all respect for you I love y\\'all and so an ex co-worker of mine made a post on Facebook about me calling me racist and homophobic and she listed my place of employment and called for people to call my employer and have me fired there were death threats made to the owners there were threats to knock down the building law enforcement had to get involved and due to the crazy reaction from the leftist mob my employer told me that they came to the conclusion that they needed to terminate my employment but here\\'s the thing here\\'s the thing losing my job is a small price to pay when God\\'s name is being glorified [Applause] and he will always make his name known but I share I share this story with you I share this story with you because what happened to me is just a small example of something that\\'s happening on a much larger scale in our nation and jemima was canceled and if you didn\\'t know Nancy green the original first aunt jemima she was a picture of the American dream she was a freed slave who went on to be the face of the pancake syrup that we love and have in our pantries today she fought for equality and now the leftist mob is trying to erase her legacy and might I mentioned how privileged we are as a nation if our biggest concern is a bottle of pancake syrup and more recently we\\'re seeing a call for statues of Jesus Christ to be torn down [Music] and now I\\'m a little confused here because last week Jesus was a social justice warrior and this week he\\'s the face of white supremacy and Jimmy Kimmel has been calling our president racist for years and it turns out he\\'s the racist there\\'s there\\'s governors that are getting away with wearing blackface that\\'s just sliding under the radar so I want to encourage you all to stand firm in your beliefs we need truth we need hard cold facts and truth now more than we ever have before and we are so blessed to have a president who stands on the frontlines walks through the fire every day to fight for our god-given American freedom [Applause] do not apologize to the mob and thank you president Trump for never apologizing to the mob for always standing firm for being here for the American people and for fighting for our best interests because you are the change that we need to see in America thank you [Applause] Thank You Reagan that was beautiful you know as your story reminds us Reagan true courage is defying the left\\'s orthodoxy not submitting to we don\\'t submit nobody should be submitting because we\\'re winning and we\\'re going to win but you don\\'t submit the fake news progressive companies right there they\\'re right back there watching us and other institutions merely toeing the left-wing line have sacrificed their intellectual credibility and professional integrity they have very little integrity left some of them have none you\\'re the ones taking real risks you\\'re showing real guts and making a virtuous stand with the rise of social media massive multinational tech companies have tried to clamp down on American democracy that even means on me and as everyone knows they\\'re using their enormous power to silence conservative voices you know that it\\'s not even close I don\\'t even think they\\'re hiding it anymore to protect our democracy I signed an executive order to remove legal protections for social media companies that unjustly censor American citizens [Applause] the radical left is also working to eliminate free speech on our college campuses with us today is near more a student at the University of st. Thomas in Minnesota whose experiences persecution firsthand dear please come up please [Applause] [Applause] first I just want to say thank you to mr. Presiden for having me on stage today so if you didn\\'t know much about Minnesota about a month ago I\\'m sure you\\'ve seen us in the headlines over the past few weeks the DFL is successfully moving our state further to the left more and more each day now that isn\\'t because people aren\\'t conservative in Minnesota it\\'s because they\\'re hell-bent on demonizing us at every turn I began my career working in politics with turning-point USA unfortunately due to the leftist culture of my campus at North Hennepin we were shut down almost immediately and were refused official recognition I was told by the faculty that political groups were not welcome on campus however they had multiple leftist groups that supported but the black lives matter movement they were pro-abortion and they\\'ve advocated for Bernie Sanders our governor the mayor and say our governor the mayor of Minneapolis and the representative of the fifth congressional district in Minnesota are all Democrats but for whatever reason the Republicans and the president take the blame for what has taken place [Music] unfortunately the murder of George Floyd has created absolute chaos in my state of Minnesota they have my place ever since the murder of George Floyd I have not seen as much division deceit and destruction in my life black lives matter only makes a scene during election years how convenient that they made the biggest scene of all during the year of the most important election of our time [Music] [Applause] black lives matter is only about police brutality once every four years in between they\\'re heavily funding a push for leftist and lgbtq+ agendas the black community\\'s culture is naturally very conservative so they mask their hidden agendas and play on the community\\'s biggest fear [Applause] if black lives matter truly cared about black lives they would not have allowed the riots to destroy black businesses and black communities [Applause] if they cared about black lives they would defund Planned Parenthood if black lives matter cared about black lives they would address the astronomically high numbers of black on black crime in inner cities they try to paint us as the bad guys for not supporting the organization but it\\'s not the same black lives matter I think there\\'s very few conservatives that believe black lives don\\'t matter [Applause] we do believe black lives matter we just believe they all matter not just the lives the left chooses to exploit I am the field director for Ilhan Omar\\'s Challenger lacy Johnson here\\'s the first republican in minnesota to have black lives matter activists and lifelong democrats want to hear what he has to say because of that they\\'ve tried to silence us at every turn people are fed up and they\\'re getting nervous they will stop at nothing to keep art their hold on us even if that means lying to the very people they\\'re supposed to represent mr. president I just want to say thank you for being exact great example of a big tent Republican the president has never needed the black vote to win but he is still done incredible work with prison reform Loren black unemployment funding HBCUs and stimulating the black community with Opportunity Zones all without pandering once upon a time the president asked the black community what we had to lose we didn\\'t have anything but now we do Thank You mr. president [Applause] wellthey\\'re I want to just tell you first of all thank you very much and so heartfelt I could see that and I also issued a historical executive order defending free speech and all of this is on college campuses and I will tell you that it\\'s something that\\'s being used by people like Charlie and used very well and it\\'s opening up a whole new voice then it\\'s my honor to have done it under my order any college that refuses to let you speak stands to lose billions of dollars in terms of the Opera [Applause] so we\\'ve done a lot we\\'ve really gone very far we\\'ve taken it to a level that nobody has ever taken it and it\\'s my honor to have done it it\\'s people like you that I do it for when you think about it it\\'s people like you you\\'re going to be the ones you\\'re going to be the ones that are at the crossroads of history that\\'s where you are right now you\\'re at a crossroads everything our forefathers built everything generations passed they shed their blood to defend the very survival of our freedoms our rights in a republic they\\'re all at stake this is a very big time in our country it\\'s a time like perhaps no other but standing here before you today I have never been more confident that America will rise to new heights of great dis and glory because your generation is proving that your hearts are filled with the fire and the fervor of true American patriots [Applause] the great spirit of righteous defiance stirs deep within yes either it\\'s the same spirit that drove America\\'s frell endures and frontiersmen people that built our nation people that succeeded people that worked hard people that failed people that failed some people failed and then they made it bigger than anyone would have ever believed possible to defend all of your liberties to secure your independence it established this noble Fortress of freedom it\\'s the same spirit that compels each of you to stand strong against the dull mindless soul-crushing conformity mandated by far left pundits professors and liberal politicians they\\'re taking our country in the wrong direction and it\\'s the same fierce and untamed American spirit that will lead the young patriotic Americans of this generation to serve our country and you will serve it well you will serve it so well together we will restore our economy quickly

beneath this magnificent incredible majestic mountain monument to the greatest Americans who have ever lived today we pay tribute to the exceptional lives at extraordinary legacies of George Washington Thomas Jefferson Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt I am here is your president to proclaim before the country and before the world this monument will never be desecrated these heroes will never be defense their legacy will never ever be destroyed their achievements will never be forgotten and Mount Rushmore will stand forever as an eternal tribute to our forefathers and to our freedom [Applause] we gather tonight to herald the most important day in the history of nations July 4th 1776 at those words every American heart should swell with pride every American family should cheer with delight and every American patriot should be filled with joy because each of you lives in the most magnificent country in the history of the world and it will soon be greater than ever before [Applause] our founders launched not only a revolution in government but a revolution in the pursuit of justice equality liberty and prosperity no nation has done more to advance the human condition than the United States of America and no people have done more to promote human progress than the citizens of our great nation it was all made possible by the courage of 56 Patriots who gathered in Philadelphia two hundred and forty-four years ago and signed the Declaration of Independence they enshrined a divine truth that changed the world forever when they said all men are created equal these immortal words set in motion the unstoppable march of freedom our founders boldly declared that we are all endowed with the same divine rights given us by our Creator in heaven and that which God has given us we will allow no one ever to take away ever [Applause] 1776 represented the culmination of thousands of years of Western civilization and the triumph of not only spirit but of wisdom philosophy and reason and yet as we meet here tonight there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for struggled they bled to secure our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history to fame our heroes erase our values and indoctrinate our children [Music] angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders to face our most sacred memorials and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities many of these people have no idea why they\\'re doing this but some know exactly what they are doing they think the American people are weak and soft and submissive but no the American people are strong and proud and they will not allow our country and all of its values history and culture to be taken from them [Music] [Applause] one of their political weapons is canceled culture driving people from their jobs shaming dissenters and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees this is the very definition of totalitarianism and it is completely alien to our culture and to our values and it has absolutely no place in the United States of America [Applause] this attack on our Liberty our magnificent Liberty must be stopped and it will be stopped very quickly we will expose this dangerous movement protect our nation\\'s children and this radical assault and preserve our beloved American Way of life in our schools our newsrooms even our corporate boardrooms there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance if you do not speak its language performance rituals recite its mantras and follow its commandments then you will be censored banished blacklisted persecuted and punished it\\'s not going to happen to us [Applause] make no mistake this left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution in so doing they would destroy the very civilization that rescued billions from poverty disease violence and hunger and that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement discovery and progress to make this possible they are determined to tear down every statue symbol and memory of our national heritage [Applause] that\\'s very true actually that is why I am deploying federal law enforcement to protect our monuments arrest the rioters and prosecute offenders to the fullest extent of the law thank you I am pleased to report that yesterday federal agents arrested the suspected ringleader of the attack on the Statue of the great Andrew Jackson in Washington DC and in addition hundreds more have been arrested under the executive order I signed last week pertaining to the veterans memorial preservation and recognition Act and other laws people who damage or deface federal statues or monuments will get a minimum of 10 years in prison and obviously that includes our beautiful Mount Rushmore our people have a great memory they will never forget the destruction of statues and monuments to George Washington Abraham Lincoln Alyssia says grant abolitionists and many others the violent mayhem we have seen in the streets and cities that are run by Liberal Democrats in every case is the predictable result of years of extreme indoctrination and bias and education journalism and other cultural institutions against every law of society in nature our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but that were villains the radical view of American history is a web of lies all perspective is removed every virtue is obscured every motive is twisted every fact is distorted and every flaw is magnified until the history is purged and the record is disfigured beyond all recognition this movement is openly attacking the legacies of every person on mount rushmore they defile the memory of Washington Jefferson Lincoln and Roosevelt today we will set history and history\\'s record straight [Applause] before these figures were immortalized in stone they were American Giants in full flesh-and-blood gallant men whose intrepid deeds unleashed the greatest leap of human advancement the world has ever known tonight I will tell you and most importantly the youth of our nation the true stories of these great great men from head to toe George Washington represented the strength Grace and dignity of the American people from a small volunteer force of citizen farmers he created the Continental Army out of nothing and rallied them to stand against the most powerful military on earth through 8 long years through the brutal winter at Valley Forge through setback after setback on the field of battle he led those Patriots to ultimate triumph when the army had dwindled to a few thousand men at Christmas of 1776 when defeat seemed absolutely certain he took what remained of his forces on a daring nighttime crossing of the Delaware River they marched through nine miles of frigid darkness many without boots on their feet leaving a trail of blood in the snow in the morning they seized victory at Trenton after forcing the surrender of the most powerful empire on the planet at Yorktown General Washington did not claim power but simply returned to Mount Vernon as a private citizen when called upon again he presided over the constitutional convention in Philadelphia and was unanimously elected our first president [Applause] when he stepped down after two terms his former adversary King George called him the greatest man of the age he remains first in our hearts to this day for as long as Americans love this land we will honor and cherish the father of our country George Washington he will never be removed abolished and most of all he will never be forgotten [Applause] Thomas Jefferson the great Thomas Jefferson was 33 years old when he traveled north to Pennsylvania and brilliantly authored one of the greatest treasures of human history the Declaration of Independence he also drafted virginia\\'s constitution and conceived and wrote the Virginia statute for religious freedom a model for our cherished First Amendment after serving as the first secretary of state and then vice president he was elected to the presidency he ordered American warriors to crush Barbary pirates he doubled the size of our nation with the Louisiana Purchase and he sent the famous explorers Lewis and Clark into the West on a daring expedition to the Pacific Ocean he was an architect an inventor a diplomat a scholar the founder of one of the world\\'s great universities in an ardent defender of Liberty Americans will forever admire the author of American freedom Thomas Jefferson and he too will never ever be abandoned by us Abraham Lincoln the savior of our union was a self-taught country lawyer who grew up in a log cabin on the American frontier the first republican president he rose to high office from obscurity based on a force and clarity of his anti-slavery convictions very very strong convictions he signed the law that built the Transcontinental Railroad he signed the Homestead Act given to some incredible scholars as simply defined ordinary citizens free land to settle anywhere in the American West and he led the country through the darkest hours of American history giving every ounce of strength that he had to ensure that government of the people by the people and for the people did not perish from this earth [Music] [Applause] he served as commander-in-chief of the US Armed Forces during our bloodiest war the struggle that saved our union and extinguished the evil of slavery over 600,000 died in that war more than 20,000 were killed or wounded in a single day in an tiem at Gettysburg 157 years ago the Union bravely withstood an assault of nearly 15,000 men and threw back Pickett\\'s Charge Lincoln won the Civil War he issued the Emancipation Proclamation he led the passage of the 13th amendment abolishing slavery for all time and ultimately his determination to preserve our nation and our Union cost him his life for as long as we live Americans will uphold and revere the immortal memory of President Abraham Lincoln Theodore Roosevelt exemplified the unbridled confidence of our national culture and identity he saw the tower grandeur of America\\'s mission in the world and he pursued it with overwhelming energy and zeal as a lieutenant colonel during the spanish-american war he led the famous Rough Riders to defeat the enemy at San Juan Hill he cleaned up corruption as police commissioner of New York City then served as the governor of New York vice president and at 42 years old became the youngest-ever president of the United States he sent our great new naval fleet around the globe to announce America\\'s arrival as a world power he gave us many of our national parks including the Grand Canyon he oversaw the construction of the awe-inspiring Panama Canal and he is the only person ever awarded both the Nobel Peace Prize and the Congressional Medal of Honor he was American freedom personified in full the American people will never relinquish the bold beautiful and untamed spirit of Theodore Roosevelt [Applause] no movement that seeks to dismantle these treasured American legacies can possibly have a love of America at its heart can\\'t happen no person who remains quiet at the destruction of this resplendent heritage can possibly lead us to a better future the radical ideology attacking our country advances under the banner of social justice but in truth it would demolish both justice and society it would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and it would turn our free and inclusive society into a place of repression domination and exclusion they want to silence us but we will not be silenced [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you thank you very much thank you very much we will state the truth in full without apology we declare that the United States of America is the most just an exceptional nation ever to exist on earth we are proud of the fact that our country was founded on judeo-christian principles and we understand that these values have dramatically advanced the cause of peace and justice throughout the world we know that the American family is the bedrock of American life we recognize the solemn right and moral duty of every nation to secure its borders and we are building the wall we remember that governments exist to protect the safety and happiness of their own people a nation must care for its own citizens first we must take care of America first it\\'s time we believe in equal opportunity equal justice and equal treatment for citizens of every race background religion and create every child of every color born and unborn is made in the holy image of God we want free and open debate not speech codes and cancel culture we embrace tolerance not prejudice we support the courageous men and women of law enforcement [Music] we will never abolish our police or our great second Amendment which gives us the right to keep and bear arms we believe that our children should be taught to love their country honor their history and respect our great American flag we stand tall we stand proud and we only kneel to Almighty God this is who we are this is what we believe and these are the values that will guide us as we strive to build an even better and greater future those who seek to erase our heritage one Americans to forget our pride and our great dignity so that we can no longer understand ourselves or America\\'s destiny in toppling the heroes of 1776 they seek to dissolve the bonds of love and loyalty that we feel for our country and that we feel for each other their goal is not a better America their goal is to end America in its place they want power for themselves but just as Patriots did in centuries past the American people will stand in their way and we will win and win quickly and with great dignity we will never let them rip America\\'s Heroes from our monuments or from our hearts by tearing down Washington and Jefferson these radicals would tear down the very heritage for which men gave their lives to win the Civil War they would erase the memory that inspired those soldiers to go to their deaths singing these words of the Battle Hymn of the Republic as he died to make men holy let us die to make men free while God is marching on [Applause] they would tear down the principles that propelled the abolition of slavery and ultimately around the world ending an evil institution that had plagued humanity for thousands and thousands of years our opponents would tear apart the very documents that Martin Luther King used to express his dream and the ideas that were the foundation of the righteous movement for civil rights they would tear down the beliefs culture and identity that have made America the most vibrant and tolerant society in the history of the earth my fellow Americans it is time to speak up loudly and strongly and powerfully and defend the integrity of our country [Applause] it is time for our politicians to summon the bravery and determination of our American ancestors it is time it is time to plant our flag and to protect the greatest of this nation for citizens of every race in every city and every part of this glorious land for the sake of our honor for the sake of our children for the sake of our union we must protect and preserve our history our heritage and our great heroes here tonight before the eyes of our forefathers Americans declare again as we did two hundred and forty-four years ago we will not be terrorized we will not be demeaned and we will not be intimidated by bad evil people it will not happen [Music] we will proclaim the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and we will never surrender the spirit and the courage and the cause of July 4th 1776 upon this ground we will stand firm and unwavering in the face of lies meant to divide us demoralize us and diminish us we will show that the story of America unites us inspires us includes us all and makes everyone free we must demand that our children are taught once again to see America as did Reverend Martin Luther King when he said that the founders had signed a promissory note to every future generation dr. King saw that the mission of justice required us to fully embrace our founding ideals those ideals are so important to us the founding ideals he called on his fellow citizens not to rip down their heritage but to live up to their heritage above all our children from every community must be taught that to be American is to inherit the spirit of the most adventurous and confident people ever to walk the face of the earth Americans are the people who pursued our manifest destiny across the ocean into the uncharted wilderness over the tallest mountains and then into the skies and even into the stars we are the country of Andrew Jackson alyssia\\'s s Grant and Frederick Douglass we are the land of Wild Bill Hickok and Buffalo Bill Cody we are the nation that gave rise to the Wright brothers the Tuskegee Airmen Harriet Tubman Clara Barton Jesse Owens George Patton General George Patton the great Louis Armstrong Alan Shepard Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali and only America could have produced them all no other place we are the culture that put up the Hoover Dam laid down the highways and sculpted the skyline of Manhattan we are the people who dreamed a spectacular dream it was called Las Vegas in the Nevada desert who built up Miami from the Florida Marsh and who carved our heroes into the face of Mount Rushmore Americans harnessed electricity split the atom and gave the world the telephone and the internet we set all the Wild West one two world wars landed American astronauts on the moon and one day very soon we will plant our flag on Mars we gave the world the poetry of Walt Whitman the stories of Mark Twain the songs of Irving Berlin the voice of Ella Fitzgerald the style of Frank Sinatra the comedy of Bob Hope the power of the Saturn five rocket the toughness of the Ford f-150 and the awesome might of the American aircraft carriers Americans must never lose sight of this miraculous story we should never lose sight of it nobody has ever done it like we have done it so today under the authority vested in me as president of the United States [Music] I am announcing the creation of a new monument to the Giants of our past I am signing an executive order to establish the National Guard of American heroes a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans to ever live from this night and from this magnificent place let us go forward United in our purpose and rededicated in our resolve we will raise the next generation of American patriots we will write the next thrilling chapter of the American adventure and we will teach our children to know that they live in a land of legends that nothing can stop them and that no one can hold them down they will know that in America you can do anything you can be anything and together we can achieve anything [Music] uplifted by the Titans of Mount Rushmore we will find unity that no one expected we will make strides that no one thought possible this country will be everything that our citizens have hoped for for so many years and that our enemies fear because we will never forget that the American freedom exists for American greatness and that\\'s what we have American greatness centuries from now our legacy will be the cities we built the champions we forged the good that we did and the monuments we created to inspire us all my fellow citizens America\\'s destiny is in our sights America\\'s heroes are embedded in our hearts America\\'s future is in our hands and ladies and gentlemen the best is yet to come [Applause] and hello again from fox news in washington today from the white house we\\'re on the president\\'s patio just outside the oval office president trump you\\'ve agreed to answer all manner of questions no subject off-limits thank you and welcome back to fox news sunday thank you very much let\\'s start with the surge of the coronavirus across the country in recent months you still talk about it as quote burning embers but i want to put up a chart that shows where we are with the illness over the last four months as you can see we hit a peak here in april 36 000 cases it\\'s cases a day cases then it went down and now since june it has gone up more than doubled one day this week 75 000 new cases more than double chris that\\'s because we have great testing because we have the best testing in the world if we didn\\'t test you wouldn\\'t be able to show that chart if we tested half as much those numbers would be down but but this is burning embers sir this is a foreign but i don\\'t say i say flames we\\'ll put out the flames and we\\'ll put out in some cases just burning embers we also have burning embers we have embers and we do have flames florida became more flame-like but it\\'s uh it\\'s going to be under control and you know it\\'s not just this country it\\'s many countries we don\\'t talk about it in the news they don\\'t talk about mexico and brazil and still parts of europe which actually got hit sooner than us so it\\'s a little ahead of us in that sense but you take a look why don\\'t they talk about mexico which is not helping us and all i can say is thank god i build most of the wall because if i didn\\'t have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with mexico but sir we have the seventh highest mortality rate in the world our mortality rate is higher than brazil it\\'s higher than russia and the european union has us on a travel ban yeah i think what we\\'ll do well we have them in a travel ban too chris i closed them off if you remember i was the one that did the european union very early but when you talk about mortality rates i think it\\'s the opposite i think we have one of the lowest mortality rates we had 900 deaths in a single day we will take this week ready do you please get me the mortality right yeah kaylee\\'s right here i heard we have one of the lowest maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world you have the numbers please because i heard we had the best mortality right number number one low mortality right i hope you show the scenario because it shows what fake news is all about you said we had the worst mortality rate in the world and we have the best all right it\\'s a little complicated but bear with us we went with numbers from johns hopkins university which charted the mortality rate for 20 countries hit by the virus the u.s ranked seventh better than the united kingdom but worse than brazil and russia the white house went with this chart from the european cdc which shows italy and spain doing worse but countries like brazil and south korea doing better other countries doing better like russia aren\\'t included in the white house charge california locking down again florida deadliest day of the entire pandemic uh hospitals at capacity a number of places around the country shortages of testing shortages of personal protective equipment for nurses and doctors a lot of people say this is because we don\\'t have a national plan you talk about states we don\\'t have a national plan do you take responsibility for that look i take responsibility always for everything because it\\'s ultimately my job too i have to get everybody in line some governors have done well some governors have done poorly they\\'re supposed to have supplies they didn\\'t have i supplied everybody now we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas and other areas we\\'re doing great but we have a surge in certain areas but you don\\'t hear people complaining about ventilators we\\'ve got all the ventilators we can use we\\'re supplying them to other countries we go out into parking lots and everything everybody gets a test we find if we did half the testing with all of that being said i\\'m glad we did it this is the right way to do it i\\'m glad we did what we\\'re doing but we have more tests by far than any country in the world but sir testing is up 37 well that\\'s very good i understand cases are up 194 it isn\\'t just the testing has gone up it\\'s that the virus has spread the positivity rate has increased there are many of those cases many of those cases are young people that would heal in a day they have the sniffles and we put it down as a test many of them don\\'t forget i guess it\\'s like 99.7 percent people are going to get better and in many cases they\\'re going to get better very quickly we go out and we look and then on the news look if you go back to the news all of your even your wonderful competitors you\\'ll see cases are up well cases are up many of those cases shouldn\\'t even be cases cases are up because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most tested no country has ever done what we\\'ve done in terms of testing we are the envy of the world they call and they say the most incredible job anybody\\'s done is our job on testing because we\\'re going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests you look at other countries they don\\'t even do tests they do test if somebody walks into the hospital they\\'re sick they\\'re really sick they test them then or they\\'ll test them in a doctor\\'s office but they don\\'t go around have massive areas of testing and we do and i\\'m glad we do but it really skews the numbers i\\'m going to do you a favor because i\\'m sure a lot of people listening right now are going to say trump he tries to play it down he tries to make it not seem as serious as it is 75 000 cases a day show me the death chart well i don\\'t have the doubt the death chart is a thousand cases a day excuse me it\\'s all too much it shouldn\\'t be one case it came from china they should have never let it escape they should have never let it out but it is what it is take a look at europe take a look at the numbers in europe and by the way they\\'re having surgeries are 6 000 in the whole european union they don\\'t test they don\\'t test like it\\'s impossible that they don\\'t have the viruses badly it\\'s possible that they don\\'t test that\\'s what\\'s possible we find cases and many of those cases heal automatically we\\'re finding in a way we\\'re creating trouble certainly we\\'re creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say oh we have more cases look we did something that nobody\\'s ever done not only the ventilators where we\\'re supplying them all over the world we did a testing program the likes of which nobody\\'s ever done before the head of the cdc dr redfield said this on tuesday i do think the fall and the winter of 2020 and 2021 are going to be probably one of the most difficult times that we\\'ve experienced in american public health do you agree with dr redfield i don\\'t know and i don\\'t think he knows i don\\'t think anybody knows with this this is a very tricky deal everybody thought the summer it would go away and we\\'d come back in the fall well in the summer it came they used to say the heat the heat was good for it and it really knocks it out remember and then it might come back in the fall so they got that one wrong they they got a lot wrong they got a lot wrong the world health got a tremendous amount wrong they basically did whatever china wanted them to and will save now almost 500 million dollars a year which is nice but the world health got a lot wrong but this is one of the sharpest criticisms of you i agree people say that you talk about the world as you\\'d like to see it rather than follow the science no well let me let me just ask the question sir why on earth would your administration be involved in a campaign at this point to discredit dr fauci who is the nation\\'s top infectious disease expert because we\\'re not if one man from my administration doesn\\'t like him because he made a few mistakes look dr fauci said don\\'t wear a mask dr fauci told me not to ban china it would be a big mistake i did it over and above his recommendation dr fauci then said you saved tens of thousands of lives more than that he said you saved tens of thousands of lives dr fauci has made some mistakes but i have a very good i spoke to him yesterday at length i have a very good relationship with dr fatcher but sir this week this weekend your white house put out a series of statements so-called mistakes that dr fauci has had made one of your closest aides one of your right-hand men daniel\\'s daniel scavina put out this have you seen this dr dr fawcett who shows him as a leaker and an alarmist oh i don\\'t know that he\\'s a little why he\\'s a little bit of an armist that\\'s okay a little bit i\\'m going to learn a little bit of an alarm system let me just say dr fauci at the beginning and again i have a great relationship with him i spoke to him at length yesterday dr fauci at the beginning said this will pass don\\'t worry about it this will pass he was wrong dr fauci said don\\'t ban china don\\'t ban china i did he then admitted that i was right you made mistakes too i guess everybody makes i was gonna say you said at one point it\\'s one person coming in from china and we have it under control it\\'s going to be just fine when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that\\'s a pretty good job we\\'ve done i think we\\'re going to be very good with the coronavirus i think that at some point uh that\\'s going to sort of just disappear i hope i\\'ll be right eventually i will be right eventually you know i said it\\'s going to disappear i\\'ll say it again but it\\'s going to disappear and i\\'ll be right i don\\'t think so right i don\\'t think so you know why it doesn\\'t describe it because i\\'ve been right probably more than anybody else then there are masks from the first day that the cdc said that people should wear mass on april 3rd you said you weren\\'t going to you wore a mask for the first time in public at walter reed this weekend question the cdc says if everybody wore a mask for four to six weeks we could get this under control do you regret not wearing a mask in public from the start and would you consider will you consider a national mandate that people need to wear masks no i want people to have a certain freedom and i don\\'t believe in that no and i don\\'t agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask everything disappears hey dr fauci said don\\'t wear a mask our surgeon general terrific guy said don\\'t wear a mask everybody was saying don\\'t wear a mask all of a sudden everybody\\'s got to wear a mask and as you know masks cause problems too with that being said i\\'m a believer in masks i think masks are good but i leave it up to the governors many of the governors are changing they\\'re more masked into they like the concept of masks but some of them don\\'t agree i do say this schools have to open young people have to go to school and there\\'s problems when you don\\'t go to school too and there\\'s going to be a funding problem because we\\'re not going to fund when they don\\'t open their schools we\\'re not going to fund them we\\'re not going to give them money if they\\'re not going to school if they don\\'t open two points on that first of all what the federal government gives is only is eight percent ten percent and you know what uh that\\'s a lot of money and you\\'re going to take them you know where the money goes it goes overwhelmingly to disadvantaged kids and children with disabilities let this i wouldn\\'t just put send more money so that schools be safer let the schools open did you ever see the statistics on young people below the age of 18 the state of new jersey had thousands of deaths of all of these thousands one person below the age of 18 in the entire state one person and that was a person that had i believe he said diabetes one person below the age of 18 died in the state of new jersey during all of this you know they had a hard time and they\\'re doing very well now so that\\'s it the stimulus bill is running out the end of this month the republicans say they want liability limits which the democrats don\\'t like you say that you want a payroll tax cut which even some republicans are cool to well a lot of republicans like it will you only sign a bill that has those two provisions well we\\'re going to see but we do need protections because businesses are going to get sued just because somebody walked in you don\\'t know where this virus comes from they\\'ll sit down at a restaurant they\\'ll sue the restaurant the guy\\'s out of business so we do need some kind of a you know immunity you do need it just like you need immunity for the police okay whether they like it or not you need immunity for the police but they do need a form of immunity you don\\'t know if they caught it and nobody\\'s ever going to be able to prove it one way or the other you can\\'t put these you know the people out look the democrats don\\'t want to do that because they\\'re total they\\'re totally captured by the lobby of lawyers the lawyers lobby is probably the most powerful in the country what about the payroll tax cut uh i want to see it i want to see if it\\'s win the bill uh i\\'ll have to see but yeah i would consider not signing it if we don\\'t have a payroll tax cut yes hot enough that you\\'re here mr president it\\'s hot it\\'s about uh well sort of almost record-breaking you know we wanted to do it inside this was your choice but i wanted you to sweat a little bit well we both are there has been a spike in violent crime in america in recent weeks we\\'ve seen deaths up in new york deaths up in chicago shootings how do you explain it and what are you going to do about it i explain it very simply by saying that they\\'re democrat-run cities they\\'re liberally run they\\'re stupidly run we have forced them in seattle to end the chop because you know we were going in that following day you probably have heard it we were getting ready to go in we were all set and when they heard that we were going they set their police force liberal democrats have been running cities in this country for decades poorly why is it so bad right now uh they\\'ve run them poorly it was always bad but now it\\'s gotten totally out of control and it\\'s really because they want to defund the police and biden wants to fun sir he does not look he signed a charter with bernie sanders i will get that one just like i was right on the mortality rate did you read the charter that he agreed there\\'s nothing about the funding oh really it says abolish it says let\\'s go all right let me give me the charter please all right chris you\\'ve got to start studying for this he says defund the police he says defund the police they talk about abolishing the police they talk about illegal aliens i look forward to seeing that meanwhile the george floyd murder has reignited the issue of racism in policing in this country i want to give you a couple of statistics nationwide blacks are twice as likely fewer in absolute numbers but in terms of per capita blacks are twice as likely to be shot and killed by police as whites are in minneapolis over the last five years police used force against blacks at a rate seven times that against whites can you understand why blacks would be angry at that of course i do of course they do many whites are killed also you have to say that i mean many many whites are killed i hate the sound but this is going on for decades this is going on for a long time long before i got here you know if you look at what\\'s going on in portland those are anarchists and we\\'ve taken a very tough stand if we didn\\'t take a stand in portland you know we\\'ve arrested many of these leaders if we didn\\'t take that stand right now you would have a problem like you they were going to lose portland so let\\'s see what this says here prosecution sanctuary cities incentivize illegal alien expand asylum abolish immigration detention no that\\'s not what we\\'ll find okay this thing is many pages long end prosecution of illegal border crosses support deathly and these are the worst things i\\'m not disagreeing with you on any of those i\\'m disagreeing about defund police the white house never sent us evidence the bernie biden platform calls for defunding or abolishing police because there is none it calls for increased funding for police departments that meet certain standards biden has called for redirecting some police funding for related programs like mental health counseling this week you said that black lives matter and the confederate flag are both matters issues of freedom of speech but in the case of the confederate flag there are a lot of people who say these were traitors who split from this country fought this country in large part to preserve slavery is the confederate flag offensive it depends on who you\\'re talking about when you\\'re talking about when people proudly have their confederate flags they\\'re not talking about racism they love their flag it represents the south they like the south people right now like the south i say it\\'s freedom of of many things but it\\'s freedom of speech so you\\'re not offended by it well i\\'m not offended either by black lives matter that\\'s freedom of speech and you know the whole thing with canceled culture we can\\'t cancel our whole history we can\\'t forget that the north and the south fought we have to remember that otherwise we\\'ll end up fighting again you can\\'t you can\\'t just cancel all this but let me ask you this when it gets to be more than just cancel well maybe this is cancelled culture the national defense authorization act the ndaa you have threatened to veto it because in the bill and this is supported by republicans as well as democrats it would rename army bases named for confederate generals now this is a bill that funds military operations it gives soldiers a pay raise you\\'re going to veto that because they\\'ll get their pay raise hey look don\\'t tell me this i got soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our understood of our military i got soldiers brand new equipment brand new jets brand new rockets brand new 2.5 trillion i did more for the military than any president that\\'s ever had this because i think that fort bragg fought robert and lee all of these forts that have been named that way for a long time decades and decades the military says they\\'re for that excuse me i don\\'t care what the military says i do i\\'m supposed to make the decision fort bragg is a big deal we won two world wars nobody even knows general bragg we won two world wars go to that community where fort bragg is in a great state i love that state go to go to the community say how do you like the idea of renaming fort bragg and then what are we going to name it you\\'re going to name it after the reverend al sharpton what are you going to name it chris tell me what you\\'re going to name it so there\\'s a whole thing here we won two world wars two world wars beautiful world wars that were vicious and horrible and we want them out of fort bragg we want to out of all of these forts that now they want to throw those names away and no i\\'m against that and you know what most other people are and i even i don\\'t believe in polls because i see the fakest polls i\\'ve ever seen but that poll is a 64 thing which actually surprised me we won world wars out of these out of these military bases no i\\'m not going to go changing them i\\'m not going to say you\\'ll be each of them i might yeah i might at mount rushmore on july 3rd you said that we face a far left fascism in this country and then you said this our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but that were villains you said our children are taught in school to hate our country where do you see that i just look at i look at school i watch i read look at the stuff now they want to change if 1492 columbus discovered america you know we grew up you grew up we all did that\\'s what we learned now they want to make it the 1619 project where did that come from what does it represent i don\\'t even know so slavery that\\'s what they\\'re saying but they don\\'t even know they just want to make a change cancel culture i hate the term actually but i use it better they cancel people hate i think so yeah i think so look at the professors look at what\\'s going on in the colleges if a conservative goes on a college and look we have as many as them excuse me i think to the best of my knowledge we\\'re sitting at the white house and the oval office is right behind me we have as many as them but who\\'s them the liberal radical left and i\\'m not talking all i think liberal i i could tell you i like a lot of liberal people like like a lot of liberal governors and senators but but chris we have a radical left destructive ideology and it\\'s being taught in our schools and don\\'t act like you\\'re surprised to hear this there are books written about it and we can\\'t let that go on we can\\'t let them change the true meaning of what we\\'re all about and that\\'s what they\\'re trying to do and i don\\'t want it to happen not on my watch it\\'s not going to happen on my watch mr president you\\'ll be happy to know that fox news has a new poll out today and you\\'re going to be the very first person to hear about it in the national horse race joe biden leads you by eight points 49 to 41 that\\'s i think three four points slimmer than it was a month ago and on the issues people trust biden more to handle the coronavirus by 17 points on race relations by 21 points and even on the economy they trust biden moore by one point i understand we still have more than a hundred days to this election but at this point you\\'re losing first of all i\\'m not losing because those are fake polls they were fake in 2016 and now they\\'re even more fake the polls were much worse in 2016. they interview 22 percent republican well how do you do 22 republican you see what\\'s going on uh i have other polls that put me leading and we have polls where i\\'m leading i have a poll where we\\'re leading in every swing state and i don\\'t believe that you\\'re first of all the fox polls whoever does your fox polls they\\'re among the worst they got it all wrong in 2016. they\\'ve been wrong on every poll i\\'ve ever seen i must tell you no i\\'m just telling you and and let me let me ask you this so in the economy so i\\'ve always lead on the economy by a lot i know which is why i would like to put two sentences together they wheel them out he goes up he repeats he they ask him questions he reads a teleprompter and then he goes back into his basement you tell me the american people want to have that in an age where we\\'re in trouble with other nations that are looking to do numbers on us so let me ask you a direct question no i\\'m going to ask you a direct question about joe biden is joe biden senile i don\\'t want to say that i say he\\'s not competent to be president to be president you have to be sharp and tough and so many other things he doesn\\'t even come out of his basement they think oh this is a great campaign so he goes in i\\'ll then make a speech it\\'ll be a great speech and some young guys start writing vice president biden said this this this he didn\\'t say it joe doesn\\'t know he\\'s alive okay he doesn\\'t know he\\'s alive do the american people want that number one number two i built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world not only in this country anywhere in the world until we got hit with the china virus we got hit with a virus shouldn\\'t have happened and we had to close up we saved millions of lives now we\\'ve opened it up got to go back to school we\\'re open we\\'ve got to do things we had the best job numbers we\\'ve ever had last month we should have good ones coming up in two weeks look i built the greatest economy in history i\\'m now doing it again you see the numbers the numbers are through the roof the democrats are purposely keeping their schools close keeping their states close i call to michigan i want to have a big rally in michigan do you know we\\'re not allowed to have a rally in michigan do you know we\\'re not allowed to have a rally in minnesota do you know we\\'re not allowed to have a rally in nevada we\\'re not allowed to have rallies well and these democrat run statements some people would say that that\\'s a health risk some people would say it\\'s fine i mean but i guarantee you there\\'s some issues after time everything was gone 100 they still wouldn\\'t allow it they\\'re not allowing me to do it so they\\'re not that they\\'re not allowing me to have rallies but i got to tell you if i may sir respectfully in the fox poll they ask people who is more competent who\\'s got whose mind is sounder biden beats you in that well i tell you what uh let\\'s take a test let\\'s take a test right now let\\'s go down joe and i will take a test let him take the same test that i took incidentally i took the test too when i heard that you passed it yeah how did you do it well it\\'s not the hardest task no but it has a picture and it says that and it\\'s an element no no no you see that\\'s all misrepresentation that\\'s what it was on the web it\\'s all misrepresentation because yes the first few questions are easy but i\\'ll bet you couldn\\'t even answer the last five questions i\\'ll bet you couldn\\'t they get very hard the last five well one of them was count back from 100 by seven and let me tell you you couldn\\'t answer you couldn\\'t answer all right what\\'s the question many of the questions i\\'d get you the test i\\'d like to give it but i guarantee you that joe biden could not answer those questions okay and i answered all 35 questions correctly you you talk about how you\\'re winning campaign\\'s going well why did you replace brad parscale isn\\'t that because he\\'s a great digital guy uh we all like him a lot but i have somebody that i that was involved you know they\\'re all they were all on the 2016 campaign and we have cory and we have all the people and actually steve bannon\\'s been much better not being involved he says the greatest president ever i mean he\\'s saying things that i said let\\'s keep steve out there he\\'s doing a good job but they\\'re all being they\\'re all involved if joe biden got in first of all he won\\'t call the shots the people the radical left people that surround him will call religion will be gone okay life you could forget about that the whole question of life supreme when you say life you mean abortion absolutely a hundred percent that whole question which is a very you know it\\'s always been a 50 50 thing it\\'s actually trending a little bit more toward once religion is going to be gone what does that mean look at what they\\'re doing to the churches they won\\'t let the churches even open if they want to stand in a field six feet apart we\\'ve had churches that wanted to stand in fields six feet apart there has never been an administration that\\'s done so much as i have from tax cuts to regulation cuts to rebuilding the military to getting choice for the vets nobody\\'s done the things i\\'ve done nobody in three and a half years no other president has been able to do what i\\'ve done you\\'re running in large part on the economy you\\'ve built it once now we have the coronavirus you\\'re going to build it again and in fact you had great jobs numbers in may you had solid jobs numbers in june but i want you to look at some projections the nonpartisan congressional budget office says the unemployment rate at the end of the year will be ten and a half percent jp morgan says in the fourth quarter gdp will contract by 6.2 percent with states now rolling back some of the reopening and and well there are a lot of republicans there are a lot of republican states like texas but here\\'s they\\'ll be open very soon just ask my question there\\'s no reason for california to do to be doing what they\\'re doing all right except for november 3rd with the states shutting back the reopening in a lot of cases new lockdowns won\\'t the economy still be a problem for you on elections i don\\'t think so i think the economy is expanding and growing beautifully now the democrats want to keep it closed as long as possible because they think that\\'s good for election but i think the economy is doing very well now we\\'re coming back and we\\'re coming back at a level that nobody would have thought possible and we and by the way take a look at another i mean a gauge whether you like it or not the stock market the stock market nasdaq hit its all-time high two weeks ago and it\\'s beaten at 14 different times okay the stock market dow etc is a thousand points away from its all-time high meaning very close we\\'re going to have a stock market perhaps on november 3rd that\\'s the highest in history i want to talk to you about obamacare since the pandemic hit millions of people have lost their jobs and thereby lost their health insurance and almost a half a million have signed up for obamacare your administration just announced that you\\'re signing on to a lawsuit to overturn obamacare and replace it why does it make sense to overturn obamacare which people now are relying on democrats are going to say the man who\\'s wanted to kill obamacare is going to take away the protection for pre-existing conditions first of all we got rid of the individual mandate pre-existing conditions will always be taken care of by me and republicans 100 but you\\'ve been in the office three and a half years you don\\'t have people we haven\\'t had uh excuse me you heard me yesterday we\\'re signing a health care plan within two weeks a full and complete health care plan that the supreme court decision on daca gave me the right to do so we\\'re gonna solve we\\'re gonna sign an immigration plan a health care plan and various other plans and nobody will have done what i\\'m doing in the next four weeks the supreme court gave the president of the united states powers that nobody thought the president had by approving by doing what they did their decision on daca and daca is going to be taken care of also but we\\'re getting rid of it because we\\'re going to replace it with something much better but we got rid of already which was most of obamacare the individual mandate and that i\\'ve already won on and we won also on the supreme court but the decision by the supreme court on daca allows me to do things on immigration on health care on other things that we\\'ve never done before and you\\'re going to find it to be a very exciting two weeks your niece mary trump has written a book about you and your family and one of her main points is that she says your dad fred trump senior damaged the whole family and here\\'s what she says about what you learned from your father he learned to become the killer you mentioned the man who needs to succeed at all costs who will do anything um to get attention financial rewards and to win do you see any truth in that my father liked to win my father was a very good man he was a strong man it\\'s disgraceful that she said that she was not exactly a family favorite we didn\\'t have a lot of respect or like for her i would have never said that except she writes a book that\\'s so stupid and so vicious and it\\'s a lie my father was a great wonderful man let me just ask you this question this is not a person that i spent very much time with very little time and now i\\'m glad you\\'ve developed a pretty thick skin over the years from decades of attacks in new york tabloids now from the press here and your political opponents here in washington but even for donald trump does it hurt you at all to be attacked in such personal terms by a member of your own family uh it hurts me more about attacking my father not being kind to my mother i have a mother who was like a saint she was incredible she was an incredible woman and she was nasty even to my mother she\\'s a very scarred person she was not much of a family person but look let me just tell you my father was i think he was the most solid person i\\'ve ever met and he was a very good person he was a very very good person he was strong but he was good for her to say the kind of things a psychopath that he was a psychopath anybody that knew fred trump would call him a psychopath and you know what if he was i would tell you and i would say you know chris i was with my father and it was impossible my father was he was tough he was tough on me he was tough on all of the kids but tough in a in a solid sense in a really good sense for her to say i think the word she used was psychopath what a disgrace she ought to be ashamed of herself that book is a lie some people were surprised when you agreed to this interview to sit down with me what are you going to ask especially because of some of the mean tweets that you\\'ve said about me mike wallace wanna be nasty and obnoxious i will tell you after that one my son peter who you\\'ve met called and he said nasty no obnoxious maybe but here\\'s the question one of your beef seems to be that i put democrats on the show and i ask them questions and and i guess the question i have is don\\'t you understand it\\'s my job to put democrats on as well as republicans and to ask them probing questions just like i asked republicans i\\'m not a big fan of fox i\\'ll be honest with you they\\'ve changed a lot since roger ailes and i watch people like swalwell who i don\\'t even know he goes on the show he got less than one percent all of a sudden he\\'s on being interviewed for endless yeah but i i interviewed an answer wait i interviewed nancy i answered i uh interviewed using one tweet after i interviewed nancy pelosi and in the interview i asked her specifically about the fact in february you were in chinatown pitching tourism while the virus was spreading if the president underplayed the threat in the early days speaker pelosi didn\\'t you as well isn\\'t that legitimate to talk to the speaker of the house look i know you very well i respect you a lot i respect your father a lot i thought he\\'s one of the most talented journalists there are and you likewise are a very talented person i do think this i think you are very uh uh i think you are toward the democrat side which is okay i mean it\\'s not true if watch the james comey interview i did in december 17 significant errors in the fisa process and you say that it was handled in a thoughtful and appropriate way yeah he\\'s right i was wrong but you make it sound like you\\'re a a bystander an eyewitness you were the director of the fbi well a lot of this was going on sir sure i\\'m responsible for that\\'s why i\\'m telling you i was wrong i was overconfident as director in our procedures you couldn\\'t do as tough an interview with comey i i\\'d like to think i treat everybody the same it just seems to me that you are very prone to be nice to the democrats and maybe i\\'m wrong about that chris but it\\'s an honor to be with you it\\'s fine i love it i love it that it\\'s close to 100 degrees your choice again yeah i know that so i\\'m not saying you\\'re going to lose i am not saying that we saw how you turned it around last time i don\\'t think i\\'m going to lose at all but if you did how crushing would it be first of all let me just tell you something i know everyone wants to know that because they\\'d love to see me lose fine i\\'m not i have not seen that i\\'ve been written off do you know how many times i\\'ve been i\\'m not doing it this time don\\'t don\\'t do it because but how crushing would it be and you know why i won\\'t lose because the country in the end they\\'re not going to have a man who who\\'s shot he\\'s shot he\\'s mentally shot let him come out of his basement go around i\\'ll make four or five speeches a day i\\'ll be interviewed by you i\\'ll be interviewed by the worst killers that hate my my guts they hate my guts there\\'s nothing they can ask me that i won\\'t give them a proper answer to some people will like it some people won\\'t like i agree with that but look you answered let biden sit through an interview like this he\\'ll be on the ground crying for mommy he\\'ll say mommy mommy please take me home well we\\'ve asked him for an interview sir he can\\'t do an interview he\\'s incompetent there\\'s a number you don\\'t mention it\\'s called the enthusiasm number the enthusiasm for trump is through the roof i haven\\'t mentioned it even higher than last time the enthusiasm for biden is non-existent everyone knows each other but the enthusiasm against you okay that\\'s his only shot right that\\'s his only shot i agree and those people know i\\'m doing a good job but there\\'s something in my personality that they don\\'t like because look nobody\\'s done what i\\'ve done biden wants to come in and ruin our country triple your taxes he wants to do things he wants to add regulations that i\\'ve all cut and we still have regulation a lot of regulation but i\\'ve cut it down to a level that nobody\\'s nobody ever thought possible he will destroy this country but it won\\'t be him it will be the radical left the same type ideology that took over venezuela one of the richest countries in the world they now have no water they have no food and they have no medicine that\\'s going to happen two final questions a few wins in general not talking about november are you a good loser i\\'m not a good loser i don\\'t like to lose it i don\\'t lose too often i don\\'t like something but are you gracious you don\\'t know until you see it depends i think mail-in voting is is going to rig the election i really do uh are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election i have to say look hillary clinton asked me the same thing no i asked you the same thing in the debate there is a tradition in this country in fact one of the prize of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard fought a campaign is that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner not saying that you\\'re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country are you saying you\\'re not prepared now what i\\'m saying is that i will tell you at the time i\\'ll keep you in suspense well chris and you know what she\\'s the one that never accepted her great she never accepted her loss and she looks like can you give can you give a direct answer you will accept the election look you i have to see no i\\'m not going to just say yes i\\'m not going to say you know and i didn\\'t last time either whether it\\'s in 2021 or 2025 how will you regard your years as president of the united states i think i was very unfairly treated uh from before i even won i was under investigation by a bunch of thieves crooks it was an illegal investigation but what about the russia what about the good parts there no i want to know this i have done more than any president in history in the first three and a half years and i\\'ve done it suffering through investigations where people have been general flynn where people have been so unfairly treated the russia hoax it was all a hoax the mueller scam it was all a scam it was all false i made a bad decision on one bad decision jeff sessions and now i feel good because he lost overwhelmingly in the great state of alabama here\\'s the bottom line i\\'ve been very unfairly treated and i don\\'t say that as paranoid i\\'ve been very everybody says it it\\'s going to be interesting to see what happens but there\\'s tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated i was president obama and biden spied on my campaign it\\'s never happened in history if it were the other way around the people would be in jail for 50 years right now that would be comey that would be brennan that would be all of this the two lovers strzok and paige they would be in jail now for many many years they would be in jail it would have started two years ago and they\\'d be there for 50 years the fact is they illegally spied on my campaign let\\'s see what happens despite that i did more than any president in history in the first three and a half years mr president thank you thanks for talking with us thank you thank you very much ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ >> HOW ARE YOU? >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING >> HOW ARE YOU? >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING SO MUCH. WE REALLY -- YOU\\'RE OVER HERE, MR. PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. KAYLEIGH. >> OKAY. >> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME -- >> GOOD, GOOD. >> AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS. REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. >> SURE. >> OVER THE YEARS, I\\'VE HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR ADHERENCE TO A PHILOSOPHY CALLED POSITIVE THINKING. THIS IS THE MANTRA THAT IF YOU BELIEVE SOMETHING, IF YOU VISUALIZE IT -- THEN IT WILL HAPPEN. >> TO AN EXTENT. I ALSO THINK IN TERMS OF THE DOWNSIDE. >> RIGHT. >> I DO. I\\'VE BEEN GIVEN A LOT OF CREDIT FOR POSITIVE THINKING. BUT I ALSO THINK ABOUT DOWNSIDE, BECAUSE ONLY A FOOL DOESN\\'T. >> TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT POSITIVE THINKING MINDSET IS SUITABLE TO HANDLING THE WORST PANDEMIC THAT WE\\'VE SEEN IN A CENTURY? >> I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE A POSITIVE OUTLOOK. OTHERWISE, YOU WOULD HAVE NOTHING WITHOUT A POSITIVE OUTLOOK. I THINK WE\\'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. BETWEEN THE VENTILATORS AND STOPPING VERY INFECTED PEOPLE FROM CHINA COMING IN, MEANING PUTTING THE BAN ON CHINA, WHICH FRANKLY NOBODY WANTED ME TO DO. PRACTICALLY NOBODY, \\'CAUSE IT WAS VERY EARLY IN JANUARY. THEN PUTTING THE BAN ON EUROPE, NOT AN EASY THING TO DO. WHEN YOU PUT A BAN ON EUROPE, THAT\\'S A BIG THING. WE WOULD\\'VE PROBABLY LOST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES MORE HAD I NOT DONE THAT. AND ALL OF THE EXPERTS, EVERY ONE OF THEM, NOT ONE OF THEM WANTED TO DO IT. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TOO SEVERE. THREE MONTHS LATER, THEY WERE ALL SAYING, \"I\\'M GLAD YOU DID IT.\" >> THE CRITICISM OF YOU THAT -- THAT IS MOST PROMINENT IS ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION, IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS SAYING THAT IT NEEDS TO BE BASED IN REALITY. AND THEY\\'RE SAYING THAT THE WISHFUL THINKING AND THE SALESMANSHIP IS JUST NOT SUITABLE AT A TIME WHEN A PANDEMIC HAS KILLED 145,000 AMERICANS. AND IT\\'S THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU\\'RE SAYING, THAT PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR POSITIVE THINKING. BUT, YOU KNOW, FOR THE PAST FIVE MONTHS, IT\\'S BEEN, \"THE VIRUS IS TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL,\" AND THE CASES HAVE BEEN GOING UP AND THE DEATHS -- >> IT HAS -- >> HAVE BEEN GOING UP. >> LOOK, LOOK. >> BUT YOU\\'VE BEEN SAYING IT\\'S UNDER CONTROL -- >> NOBODY KNEW WHAT THIS THING WAS ALL ABOUT. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. 1917, BUT IT WAS A TOTALLY -- >> YEAH. >> DIFFERENT -- IT WAS A FLU. >> YEP. >> IN THAT CASE -- OKAY? BUT OTHER THAN 1917, THERE\\'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. AND, BY THE WAY, IF YOU WATCH THE FAKE NEWS ON TELEVISION, THEY DON\\'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 188 OTHER COUNTRIES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE SUFFERING, SOME PROPORTIONATELY FAR GREATER THAN WE ARE, OKAY? AS BAD AS WE ARE -- >> VERY FEW WORSE. >> SOME PROPORTIONATELY GREATER THAN WE ARE. RIGHT NOW -- RIGHT NOW, SPAIN IS HAVING A BIG SPIKE. THERE ARE TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD. YOU LOOK AT MOSCOW, LOOK AT WHAT\\'S GOING ON WITH MOSCOW. LOOK AT BRAZIL. LOOK AT THESE COUNTRIES, WHAT\\'S GOING ON. THIS WAS SENT TO US BY CHINA, ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, AND WE\\'RE NEVER GOING TO FORGET IT. BELIEVE ME, WE\\'RE NEVER GOING TO FORGET IT. AND WE WERE BEATING CHINA AT EVERY SINGLE POINT. WE WERE BEATING THEM ON TRADE. WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS LIKE NOBODY\\'S EVER MADE PROGRESS. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, THEY HAD THE WORST YEAR, JONATHAN, THAT THEY\\'VE HAD IN 67 YEARS. YOU KNOW THAT. WITH THE TARIFFS AND EVERYTHING ELSE I DID. WE WERE TAKING IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I WAS GIVING SOME OF IT TO THE FARMERS. THE FARMERS WERE DOING WELL BECAUSE I WAS TARGETING -- THEY WERE TARGETING THE FARMERS. I WAS TARGETING CHINA. WE WERE DOING GOOD. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE GAME CHANGED, AND I HAD TO CLOSE IT DOWN. I CLOSED DOWN THE GREATEST ECONOMY EVER IN HISTORY. >> I -- WELL, WAIT. >> YEAH. AND THEN I CLOSED IT DOWN. AND NOW, WE\\'RE OPENING IT. AND WE -- BY THE WAY, BY CLOSING IT DOWN, WE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES. IF WE WOULD HAVE GONE THE HERD -- AND WE KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE DISEASE. IF WE WOULD HAVE GONE HERD, WE WOULD HAVE LOST MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. ONE PERSON\\'S TOO MUCH. WE\\'RE AT 140,000 PEOPLE. ONE PERSON IS TOO MUCH. WE\\'RE AT 140. WE WOULD HAVE LOST MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. AND THOSE PEOPLE THAT REALLY UNDERSTAND IT -- THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND IT, THEY SAID, \"IT\\'S INCREDIBLE,\" THE JOB THAT WE\\'VE DONE. AND, AGAIN, I BRING IT UP -- >> WHO SAYS THAT? >> THE BAN -- BANNING CHINA FROM COMING IN -- >> BUT IT WAS ALREADY -- >> FAR EARLIER -- >> IT WAS ALREADY IN HERE BY THE TIME -- >> WHAT\\'S THAT? >> IT WAS ALREADY HERE. LIKE, BY THE TIME YOU BANNED CHINA -- >> IT WAS THERE, BUT -- >> NOBODY KNEW THE EXTENT. NOBODY KNEW HOW CONTAGIOUS IT -- >> I\\'M NOT -- BUT THE QUESTION IS, MR. PRESIDENT -- >> YOU KNOW THAT? MAYBE CHINA KNEW. >> BY JUNE, WE KNEW. THINGS WERE BAD. AND, YOU KNOW, THE LAST TIME I WAS WITH YOU WAS THE DAY BEFORE YOUR TULSA RALLY IN THE OVAL. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE SAYING BIG, HUGE CROWD. IT WAS INDOORS. >> BY THE WAY -- >> THESE PEOPLE, THEY LISTEN TO YOU -- >> EXCUSE ME, JONATHAN. >> YEAH? >> WE HAD A 19,000-SEAT STADIUM. FIRST OF ALL, WE HAD 12,000 PEOPLE, NOT 6,000, WHICH YOU REPORTED AND OTHER PEOPLE REPORTED. BUT YOU COULDN\\'T EVEN GET IN. IT WAS LIKE AN ARMED CAMP. >> WHY WOULD YOU HAVE WANTED THAT -- >> BECAUSE THEY HAD 120 BLACK LIVES MATTER PEOPLE -- >> I UNDERSTAND -- >> THERE -- >> BUT WHY WOULD YOU HAVE WANTED A HUGE CROWD -- >> AND TULSA -- EXCUSE ME. WAIT. AND TULSA -- WELL, BECAUSE THAT AREA WAS A VERY GOOD AREA AT THE TIME. IT WAS AN AREA THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH -- >> CASES WERE -- >> OVER. AFTER. AFTER. A MONTH LATER, IT STARTED -- >> BEFORE. >> GOING UP. THAT\\'S A MONTH LATER. BUT TULSA WAS VERY GOOD. OKLAHOMA WAS DOING VERY WELL AS A STATE. IT WAS ALMOST FREE. IT SPIKED A MONTH LATER, MONTH AND A HALF, TWO MONTHS LATER, BUT IT WAS A GOOD AREA. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS CROWD. WE HAD TREMENDOUS RESPONSE. YOU COULDN\\'T EVEN -- IT WAS LIKE AN ARMED CAMP. YOU COULDN\\'T EVEN GET THROUGH. YOU COULDN\\'T GET ANYBODY IN. >> BUT I\\'M TALKING ABOUT -- >> WE HAD 12,000 PEOPLE. IT WAS INCORRECTLY REPORTED. THE OTHER THING WE HAD THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT, SO FOX BROADCAST IT. IT WAS THE HIGHEST RATING IN THE HISTORY OF FOX TELEVISION, SATURDAY NIGHT. IT WAS THE HIGHEST RATING. >> MR. PRESIDENT -- >> MY SPEECH -- WELL, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU\\'RE SAYING SOMETHING. >> YEAH? >> THAT SPEECH WAS THE HIGHEST-RATED SPEECH IN THE HISTORY OF FOX TELEVISION ON SATURDAY NIGHT. AND NOBODY SAYS THAT -- >> I THINK YOU MISUNDERSTAND ME. I\\'M NOT CRITICIZING YOUR ABILITY TO DRAW A CROWD. >> WELL -- >> ARE YOU KIDDING ME? >> I\\'M JUST SAYING THIS -- >> I\\'VE COVERED YOU FOR FIVE YEARS. YOU DRAW MASSIVE CROWDS -- >> I\\'M JUST SAYING THIS -- >> YOU GET HUGE RATINGS. I\\'M ASKING ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH. >> AT THE TIME -- AND I CANCELED ANOTHER ONE. I HAD TO CANCEL IT. >> RIGHT. >> WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT CROWD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND I CANCELED IT FOR THE SAME REASON. >> BUT HERE\\'S THE QUESTION. YOU KNOW, I\\'VE COVERED YOU FOR A LONG TIME. I\\'VE GONE TO YOUR RALLIES. I\\'VE TALKED TO YOUR PEOPLE. THEY LOVE YOU. THEY LISTEN TO YOU. THEY LISTEN TO EVERY WORD YOU SAY. THEY HANG ON YOUR EVERY WORD. THEY DON\\'T LISTEN TO ME OR THE MEDIA OR FAUCI. THEY THINK WE\\'RE FAKE NEWS. THEY WANT TO GET THEIR ADVICE FROM YOU. AND SO WHEN THEY HEAR YOU SAY, \"EVERYTHING\\'S UNDER CONTROL. DON\\'T WORRY ABOUT WEARING MASKS,\" I MEAN, THESE ARE PEOPLE -- >> WELL -- >> MANY OF THEM ARE OLDER PEOPLE, MR. PRESIDENT -- >> WELL, WHAT\\'S YOUR DEFINITION OF CONTROL? YEAH, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT NOW -- >> IT\\'S GIVING THEM A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. >> I THINK IT\\'S UNDER CONTROL. I\\'LL TELL YOU WHAT. >> HOW? A THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE DYING A DAY. >> THEY ARE DYING. THAT\\'S TRUE. AND YOU -- IT IS WHAT IT IS. BUT THAT DOESN\\'T MEAN WE AREN\\'T DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. IT\\'S UNDER CONTROL AS MUCH AS YOU CAN CONTROL IT. THIS IS A HORRIBLE PLAGUE THAT BESET US. >> YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS AS MUCH AS WE CAN CONTROL? >> WELL -- >> A THOUSAND DEATHS A DAY? >> I\\'LL TELL YOU I\\'D LIKE TO KNOW IF SOMEBODY -- FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB. WE\\'VE GOTTEN THE GOVERNORS EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED. THEY DIDN\\'T DO THEIR -- MANY OF THEM DIDN\\'T, AND SOME OF THEM DID. SOMEDAY WE\\'LL SIT DOWN, WE\\'LL TALK ABOUT THE SUCCESSFUL ONES, THE GOOD ONES. LOOK AT THAT SMILE. THE GOOD ONES AND THE BAD. WE HAD GOOD AND BAD. AND WE HAD A LOT IN THE MIDDLE. BUT WE HAD SOME INCREDIBLE GOVERNOR -- I COULD TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WHO THE GREAT ONES ARE AND WHO THE NOT-SO-GREAT ONES ARE. BUT THE GOVERNORS DO IT. WE GAVE THEM MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL. >> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU CHANGED YOUR MESSAGE THIS WEEK IN TERMS OF YOU CANCELED THE JACKSONVILLE CONVENTION. YOU SAID, \"WEAR A MASK.\" YOU\\'RE SAYING, YOU KNOW, THAT IT\\'S GOING TO GET WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER. IT\\'S NOT SOMETHING YOU LIKE TO SAY, I KNOW, AND YOU SAID THAT. THE BIG QUESTION -- >> BY THE WAY, NOT GET WORSE LIKE THE ORIGINAL FLOW. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IT WILL GET WORSE -- >> WELL, I HOPE NOT. A THOUSAND -- >> NOW, IF YOU LOOK -- >> BUT -- >> ARIZONA\\'S GOING DOWN -- >> IF I CAN JUST FINISH MY QUESTION. >> TEXAS IS GOING DOWN, AND FLORIDA\\'S GOING DOWN. >> THE QUESTION IS: ARE YOU GOING TO -- EVEN SOME OF YOUR OWN AIDES WONDER WHETHER YOU WOULD STICK TO THAT MESSAGE UNTIL ELECTION DAY, WHETHER IN A WEEK OR TWO YOU WON\\'T SAY, \"RIGHT, WE GOT TO REOPEN AGAIN. WE GOT -- WE CAN\\'T DO THIS STUFF ANYMORE.\" THAT YOU\\'LL GET BORED OF TALKING ABOUT THE VIRUS AND GO BACK TO THAT SORT OF -- >> NO, I\\'M NOT -- >> CHEERLEADING. >> I NEVER GET BORED. I NEVER GET BORED OF TALKING ABOUT THIS. IT\\'S TOO BIG A THING. AND, AGAIN -- >> SO WILL YOU STICK TO THAT MESSAGE? >> IT COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY CHINA, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY CHINA, AND IT WASN\\'T. >> BUT NOW IT\\'S HERE. >> WE HAVE IT HERE -- >> YOU\\'RE THE PRESIDENT. >> AND I THINK I\\'M -- >> YOU\\'RE THE LEADER. >> VERY CONSISTENT. NO, THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS THING. DO YOU THINK I\\'D -- WE HAVE 140,000 PEOPLE AT THIS MOMENT -- >> MORE THAN THAT -- >> THIS IS A VERY, VERY -- >> YEAH. >> SERIOUS SITUATION. AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS HANDLE IT THE BEST IT CAN BE HANDLED. AND, AGAIN, I\\'M WORKING WITH THE GOVERNORS. I GOT THEM TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS -- >> RIGHT. >> OF EQUIPMENT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN. JONATHAN, THEY WOULDN\\'T HAVE EQUIPMENT NOW IF I DIDN\\'T GET IT. >> WHEN CAN YOU COMMIT, BY WHAT DATE, THAT EVERY AMERICAN WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME-DAY TESTING THAT YOU GET HERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE? >> WELL, WE HAVE GREAT TESTING. WHAT WE\\'RE DOING -- AND MANY -- >> BY WHAT DAY? >> OTHER PEOPLE DO -- LET ME EXPLAIN. THE TESTING. WE HAVE TESTED MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY, THAN ALL OF EUROPE PUT TOGETHER TIMES TWO. WE HAVE TESTED MORE PEOPLE THAN ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT OF. INDIA HAS 1.4 BILLION PEOPLE. THEY\\'VE DONE 11 MILLION TESTS. WE\\'VE DONE 55, IT\\'LL BE CLOSE TO 60 MILLION TESTS. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE THOSE THAT SAY, \"YOU CAN TEST TOO MUCH.\" YOU DO KNOW THAT? >> WHO SAYS THAT? >> OH, JUST READ -- >> WHO? >> THE MANUALS. READ THE BOOKS. >> MANUALS? >> READ THE BOOKS -- >> WHAT MANUALS? >> READ THE BOOKS. >> WHAT BOOKS? >> WHAT TESTING DOES -- >> WHO -- NO, I\\'M SORRY. >> IS IT SHOWS -- WAIT A MINUTE, JONATHAN -- >> WHO SAYS -- >> LET ME EXPLAIN. WHAT TESTING DOES, IT SHOWS CASES. IT SHOWS WHERE THERE MAY BE CASES. OTHER COUNTRIES TEST -- YOU KNOW WHEN THEY TEST? THEY TEST WHEN SOMEBODY\\'S SICK. THAT\\'S WHEN THEY TEST. AND I\\'M NOT SAYING THEY\\'RE RIGHT OR WRONG. NOBODY\\'S DONE IT LIKE WE\\'VE DONE IT. WE\\'VE GOTTEN ABSOLUTELY NO CREDIT FOR IT. BUT WE\\'VE COME UP WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT TESTS. THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVE NOW IS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO WAIT LONGER THAN WE\\'D LIKE THEM TO. WE WANT A -- >> IT\\'S A BIG PROBLEM. >> WE WANT POINT TO POINT. WE WANT TO HAVE A 5-MINUTE TO A 15-MINUTE TEST, LIKE WE HAVE -- >> WHEN DO YOU THINK -- >> AND LIKE MANY OTHERS. AND FROM WHAT -- >> EVERY AMERICAN? >> I UNDERSTAND, WE\\'RE CLOSE TO 50% WHERE IT\\'S POINT-TO-POINT TEST. WE ARE MAKING THOUSANDS OF INSTRUMENTS, THOUSANDS OF TESTS RIGHT NOW, TENS OF THOUSANDS THAT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED TO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. AND WE\\'VE EVEN SENT SOME OF THEM TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAD A BIG PROBLEM. JONATHAN, ALMOST 50% -- IN FACT, I THINK THE NUMBER MIGHT BE OVER -- IS IMMEDIATE TESTING. THE OTHER\\'S TOUGH. YOU TAKE A TEST. YOU HAVE TO SEND IT TO A LABORATORY. LET\\'S SAY THAT TAKES A DAY. LET\\'S SAY IT\\'S A DAY -- >> RIGHT. IT\\'S DIFFICULT. >> YOU KNOW, SO IT\\'S THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE -- >> I UNDERSTAND. >> DAYS. THERE\\'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT. >> BUT WHEN DO YOU THINK WE WILL HAVE IT FOR EVERYONE -- >> I THINK THAT YOU WILL HAVE -- >> WHAT DAY? >> THAT RELATIVELY SOON. I MEAN, AGAIN -- >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> YOU ALREADY HAVE HALF. I WOULD MUCH RATHER GET BACK TO YOU BECAUSE I DON\\'T WANT TO HAVE YOU -- >> OKAY, THAT\\'S FINE. >> WRITE IN ONE MONTH -- >> THAT\\'S FINE. >> I DIDN\\'T MAKE IT, I MISSED IT BY A DAY -- >> YEAH, I GOT IT. >> AND IT\\'S A HEADLINE. >> MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE -- THE FEDERAL INTERVENTION IN -- >> EXCUSE ME. ONE THING I -- >> YEAH? YEAH? >> WOULD SAY ABOUT TESTING. BECAUSE WE TEST SO MUCH, WE SHOW CASES. SO WE SHOW MANY, MANY CASES. WE SHOW TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF -- I KNOW YOU\\'RE SMILING WHEN I SAY THAT, BUT I\\'M TELLING YOU -- >> NO, WELL, I MEAN -- >> NO, NO. >> I\\'VE HEARD YOU SAY THIS, BUT -- >> OTHER COUNTRIES DON\\'T TEST LIKE WE DO. SO THEY DON\\'T SHOW CASES. >> JUST A COUPLE POINTS ON THAT. I WASN\\'T GOING TO CONTINUE ON THE TESTING, BUT YOU SAID IT. SO WE\\'RE TESTING SO MUCH \\'CAUSE IT\\'S SPREAD SO FAR IN AMERICA. >> WE\\'RE TESTING SO MUCH -- >> AND WHEN YOU -- >> BECAUSE WE HAD THE ABILITY TO TEST -- >> OKAY, BUT -- >> BECAUSE WE CAME UP WITH TESTS -- >> BUT SOUTH KOREA -- >> JONATHAN, WE WEREN\\'T EVEN -- WE DIDN\\'T EVEN HAVE A TEST. WHEN I TOOK OVER, WE DIDN\\'T EVEN HAVE A TEST. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS -- >> WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A TEST? >> THERE WAS NO TEST FOR THIS -- >> THE VIRUS DIDN\\'T EXIST. HOW WOULD YOU -- >> EXCUSE ME. >> HAVE A TEST? >> I WAS GOING TO SAY -- >> OKAY. >> THERE WAS NO TEST FOR THIS NEW -- WE DIDN\\'T HAVE A TEST BECAUSE THERE WASN\\'T A TEST -- >> OF COURSE. >> IN A VERY SHORT ORDER, WE GOT ONE TEST, WE GOT ANOTHER TEST, WE GOT ANOTHER -- >> IT WAS BROKEN, THE FIRST ONE. >> MANY OF THOSE TESTS ARE NOW OBSOLETE BECAUSE WE\\'VE -- >> RIGHT. >> YOU KNOW, IT\\'S CALLED SCIENCE. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, SOMETHING\\'S BETTER. BUT BECAUSE WE TESTED SO MANY PEOPLE, 55, 60 MILLION PEOPLE VERY SOON, WE GET CASES. YOU TEST, SOME KID HAS EVEN JUST A LITTLE RUNNY NOSE, IT\\'S A CASE. AND THEN YOU REPORT MANY CASES. SO WE LOOK LIKE WE HAVE MORE CASES THAN MASSIVE COUNTRIES LIKE -- >> BUT -- >> CHINA, WHICH, BY THE WAY, DOESN\\'T REPORT, AS YOU KNOW. >> WELL, I DON\\'T -- >> LIKE -- >> PUT ANY STOCK IN CHINA\\'S FIGURES -- >> NO, NO. THE POINT IS -- THE POINT -- >> YEAH? >> IS BECAUSE WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER AT TESTING THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, WE SHOW MORE CASES. >> THE FIGURE I LOOK AT IS DEATH. AND DEATH IS GOING UP NOW. >> OKAY. NO, NO. NO -- >> IT\\'S A THOUSAND A DAY. >> IF YOU LOOK AT DEATH -- OKAY, LET\\'S LOOK -- >> YEAH, IT\\'S GOING UP AGAIN. >> LET\\'S LOOK. >> DAILY DEATH. >> TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE CHARTS, OKAY -- >> I\\'D LOVE TO. >> WE\\'RE GOING TO LOOK. >> LET\\'S LOOK. >> AND IF YOU LOOK AT DEATH PER -- >> YEAH? IT STARTED TO GO UP AGAIN -- >> HERE\\'S ONE. WELL, RIGHT HERE, UNITED STATES IS LOWEST IN NUMEROUS CATEGORIES. WE\\'RE LOWER THAN THE WORLD. >> LOWER THAN THE WORLD? >> WE\\'RE LOWER THAN -- >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> EUROPE. LOOK, LOOK -- >> IN WHAT? IN WHAT? >> TAKE A LOOK. RIGHT HERE. HERE\\'S CASE DEATH. >> OH, YOU\\'RE DOING DEATH AS A PROPORTION OF CASES. I\\'M TALKING ABOUT DEATH AS A PROPORTION OF POPULATION. THAT\\'S WHERE THE U.S. IS REALLY BAD. >> WELL -- >> MUCH WORSE THAN SOUTH KOREA, GERMANY, ET CETERA. >> YOU CAN\\'T DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO GO -- >> WHY CAN\\'T I DO THAT? >> YOU HAVE TO GO BY -- YOU HAVE TO GO BY WHERE -- LOOK. HERE IS THE UNITED STATES. YOU HAVE TO GO BY THE CASES. THE CASES OF DEATH -- >> WHY NOT AS A PROPORTION OF POPULATION -- >> WHEN WE HAVE SOMEBODY -- WHAT IT SAYS IS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT -- >> YEAH? >> HAS -- WHERE THERE\\'S A CASE -- >> OH, OKAY. >> THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE FROM -- >> SO -- OH. >> THOSE CASES. >> IT\\'S SURELY A RELEVANT STATISTIC TO SAY IF THE U.S. HAS X POPULATION AND X PERCENTAGE OF DEATH OF THAT POPULATION -- >> NO, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO -- >> VERSUS SOUTH KOREA. >> BY THE CASES. >> WELL, LOOK AT SOUTH KOREA FOR -- >> IF -- >> EXAMPLE. 51 MILLION POPULATION, 300 DEATHS. IT\\'S LIKE -- IT\\'S CRAZY COMPARED TO -- >> YOU DON\\'T KNOW THAT. >> I DO. IT\\'S ON THE -- >> YOU DON\\'T KNOW THAT. >> YOU THINK THEY\\'RE FAKING THEIR STATISTICS, SOUTH KOREA? >> I WON\\'T GET INTO THAT -- >> AN ADVANCED COUNTRY? >> \\'CAUSE I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTRY. BUT YOU DON\\'T KNOW THAT. AND THEY HAVE SPIKES. LOOK, HERE\\'S ONE OF -- >> GERMANY, LOW. 9,000 -- >> HERE\\'S ONE. HERE\\'S ONE RIGHT HERE. UNITED STATES. YOU TAKE THE NUMBER OF CASES -- NO, LOOK. WE\\'RE LAST. MEANING WE\\'RE FIRST. >> LAST? I DON\\'T KNOW WHAT -- >> WE HAVE THE BEST. >> WE\\'RE FIRST IN. AS A WHAT? >> TAKE A LOOK. AGAIN -- >> OKAY. >> IT\\'S CASES. >> OKAY. >> AND WE HAVE CASES BECAUSE -- >> I MEAN -- >> OF THE TESTING. WAIT -- >> A THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE DYING A DAY. BUT I UNDERSTAND -- I UNDERSTAND ON CASES IT\\'S DIFFERENT. >> NO, BUT YOU\\'RE NOT REPORTING IT CORRECTLY, JONATHAN. >> I THINK I AM, BUT. >> IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OTHER CHART, LOOK, THIS IS OUR TESTING, I BELIEVE. THIS IS THE TESTING. YEAH. >> YEAH, WE DO MORE TESTS. >> NO, WAIT A MINUTE. WELL, DON\\'T WE GET CREDIT FOR THAT? AND BECAUSE WE DO MORE TESTS, WE HAVE MORE CASES. IN OTHER WORDS, WE TEST MORE, WE HAVE -- NOW, TAKE A LOOK. THE TOP ONE, THAT\\'S A GOOD THING, NOT A BAD THING. THE TOP -- JONATHAN. >> IF HOSPITAL RATES -- >> THE TOP IS CASES. >> WERE GOING AND DOWN DEATHS WERE GOING DOWN, I\\'D SAY, \"TERRIFIC. YOU DESERVE TO BE PRAISED FOR TESTING\" -- >> WELL, THEY DON\\'T EVEN -- >> BUT THEY\\'RE ALL GOING UP. >> YOU KNOW, THEY VERY RARELY TALK -- >> 60,000 AMERICANS ARE IN HOSPITAL. >> IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS -- >> A THOUSAND DYING A DAY. >> OR READ THE PAPERS, THEY USUALLY TALK ABOUT NEW CASES, NEW CASES, NEW CASES. >> I\\'M TALKING ABOUT DEATH. >> WELL, YOU LOOK AT DEATH -- >> IT\\'S GOING UP. >> DEATH IS WAY DOWN FROM WHERE IT WAS. >> IT\\'S A THOUSAND -- >> DEATH. >> A DAY. IT WAS TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND. IT WENT DOWN TO 500. NOW, IT\\'S GOING UP AGAIN -- >> DEATH -- EXCUSE ME. WHERE IT WAS IS MUCH HIGHER THAN WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW. >> IT WENT DOWN, AND IT WENT UP AGAIN -- >> IT SPIKED, BUT NOW IT\\'S GOING DOWN AGAIN. IT\\'S -- >> GOING UP. >> GOING DOWN IN ARIZONA. IT\\'S GOING DOWN IN FLORIDA -- >> NATIONAL -- >> IT\\'S GOING DOWN IN TEXAS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THESE ARE THE TESTS. >> IT\\'S GOING DOWN IN FLORIDA? >> YEAH, IT\\'S GOING -- IT LEVELED OUT AND IT\\'S GOING DOWN. THAT\\'S MY REPORT AS OF YESTERDAY. >> ANYWAY, MR. PRESIDENT, IF I COULD CHANGE SUBJECTS -- >> IT IS GOING DOWN IN ARIZONA. IT IS GOING DOWN -- >> ARIZONA, IT IS. >> IN TEXAS. >> ARIZONA, IT IS. TEXAS HAS BIG PROBLEMS -- >> AND IT HAS SPIKED. AND IT IS -- IT -- IT\\'S SPIKED, AND IT\\'S NOW GOING DOWN IN FLORIDA. IT\\'S EVENED OUT AND GOING DOWN IN FLORIDA. >> I\\'LL HAVE TO SEE THOSE FIGURES -- >> BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS THE NUMBER OF TESTS COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD -- >> I DON\\'T DENY YOUR FIGURES. YOU\\'VE DONE MORE TESTS BY FAR THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD -- >> RIGHT. AND BECAUSE -- >> I DON\\'T DENY THAT. >> WE\\'VE DONE MORE TESTS, WE HAVE MORE CASES. >> YOU HAVE MORE INFECT -- >> HERE, YOU CAN TAKE THAT. CHECK -- CHECK IT OUT IN YOUR OFFICE -- >> MR. PRESIDENT -- DIFFERENT SUBJECT. IT\\'S BEEN WIDELY REPORTED THAT THE U.S. HAS INTELLIGENCE INDICATING THAT RUSSIA PAID BOUNTIES OR OFFERED TO PAY BOUNTIES TO TALIBAN FIGHTERS TO KILL AMERICAN SOLDIERS -- >> RIGHT, RIGHT. >> YOU HAD A PHONE CALL WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN ON JULY 23RD. DID YOU BRING UP THIS ISSUE? >> NO, THAT WAS A PHONE CALL TO DISCUSS OTHER THINGS. AND FRANKLY, THAT\\'S AN ISSUE THAT MANY PEOPLE SAID WAS FAKE NEWS. >> WHO SAID IT WAS FAKE NEWS? >> THAT IT WAS A -- I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE. IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE WONDERFUL FOLKS FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION -- SOME OF THEM NOT ANY FRIENDS OF MINE -- WERE SAYING THAT IT\\'S A FAKE ISSUE. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID IT\\'S A FAKE ISSUE. >> THERE WAS DISPUTE -- >> WHAT WE HAD A CALL -- >> WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. >> WE HAD A CALL TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION, WHICH IS -- >> RIGHT. >> A VERY BIG SUBJECT, WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING AND SO WOULD I. WE DISCUSSED NUMEROUS THINGS. WE DID NOT DISCUSS THAT, NO. >> AND YOU\\'VE NEVER DISCUSSED IT WITH HIM? >> I HAVE NEVER DISCUSSED IT WITH HIM, NO. I WOULD. I\\'D HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT. >> BUT YOU DON\\'T BELIEVE -- >> BUT, YOU KNOW, IT NEVER GOT TO ME. >> THE INTELLIGEN -- IT\\'S \\'CAUSE YOU DON\\'T BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENCE. THAT\\'S WHY. >> EVERYTHING -- YOU KNOW, IT\\'S INTERESTING. NOBODY EVER BRINGS UP CHINA. THEY ALWAYS BRING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH RUSSIA IN TERMS OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION, WHICH IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM, BIGGER PROBLEM THAN GLOBAL WARMING, A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN GLOBAL WARMING IN TERMS OF THE REAL WORLD -- THAT WOULD BE A GREAT THING -- >> BUT JUST -- >> NO. IT NEVER REACHED MY DESK. >> OKAY. >> YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY DIDN\\'T THINK IT -- INTELLIGENCE, THEY DIDN\\'T THINK IT WAS REAL. >> IT WAS IN YOUR WRITTEN BRIEF -- >> THEY DIDN\\'T THINK -- >> THOUGH APPARENTLY. >> THEY DIDN\\'T THINK IT WAS WORTHY OF -- I WOULDN\\'T -- IF IT REACHED MY DESK, I WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IT NEVER REACHED MY DESK BECAUSE -- >> DO YOU READ YOUR WRITTEN BRIEF? >> I DO. I READ -- >> DO YOU? >> A LOT. YOU KNOW -- >> REALLY? >> I READ A LOT. THEY LIKE TO SAY I DON\\'T READ. I READ A LOT. >> YOU READ YOUR DAILY -- >> I COMPREHEND -- >> INTELLIGENCE BRIEF? >> EXTRAORDINARILY WELL. PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT YOU\\'VE INTERVIEWED IN A LONG TIME. I READ A LOT. I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH -- AT MEETINGS. USUALLY, IT\\'S ONCE A DAY OR AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK INTELLIGENCE MEETINGS -- >> \\'CAUSE THIS WAS APPARENTLY -- >> TALKING ABOUT INDIA -- >> IN YOUR WRITTEN BRIEF -- >> TALKING ABOUT -- >> RIGHT. >> THE PROBLEMS WITH CHINA, TALKING ABOUT SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD. THE WORLD IS A VERY ANGRY PLACE. IF YOU LOOK ALL OVER THE WORLD, WE CALL UP, I GET -- I SEE 22 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN INDIA, WITH CHINA, FIGHTING OVER THE BORDER. IT\\'S BEEN RAGING FOR MANY, MANY DECADES. AND THEY\\'VE BEEN FIGHTING AND BACK AND FORTH. I HAVE SO MANY BRIEFINGS ON SO MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. BUT THIS ONE DIDN\\'T REACH MY DESK. >> THE REASON I SAY THIS IS, EVEN IF YOU DON\\'T BELIEVE THE -- THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE -- AND THERE IS DISPUTE. NO DOUBT, THERE IS DISPUTE IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ABOUT IT. YOUR FORMER -- JOHN NICHOLSON, FORMER HEAD OF FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN, SAID -- THIS IS WHEN HE WAS WORKING FOR YOU -- THAT RUSSIA IS SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO THE TALIBAN. ISN\\'T THAT ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE PUTIN OVER THE KILLINGS OF U.S. SOLDIERS -- >> WELL, WE SUPPLIED WEAPONS WHEN THEY WERE FIGHTING RUSSIA, TOO. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE -- WHEN THEY WERE FIGHTING WITH THE TALIBAN WHEN -- IN AFGHANISTAN -- >> THAT\\'S A DIFFERENT ERA. >> WELL, IT\\'S A -- I\\'M JUST SAYING. YES, WE -- >> BUT DOES THAT -- >> NO, NO, I\\'M JUST SAYING -- >> HOW DOES THAT AFFECT -- >> WE DID THAT, TOO. I DON\\'T KNOW -- >> BUT HOW DOES THAT -- >> I DIDN\\'T ASK NICHOLSON ABOUT THAT. HE WAS THERE FOR A LONG TIME. DIDN\\'T HAVE GREAT SUCCESS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME. AND THEN ULTIMATELY I MADE A CHANGE. >> BUT YOU SURELY HEARD THAT, RIGHT? I MEAN, IT\\'S WELL KNOWN IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT THEY\\'RE ARMING THE TALIBAN. RUSSIA. >> I DON\\'T KNOW. WHEN YOU SAY \"ARMING,\" IS THE TALIBAN -- >> SUPPLYING WEAPONS. >> PAYING, OR ARE THEY GIVING THEM -- >> RUSSIA IS SUPPLYING WEAPONS AND MONEY TO THE TALIBAN. >> I HAVE HEARD THAT -- BUT IT\\'S NEVER RE -- AGAIN, IT\\'S NEVER REACHED MY DESK. >> I MEAN, HE SAID IT ON THE RECORD WHEN HE WAS IN -- >> HEY, RUSSIA DOESN\\'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH AFGHANISTAN. LET ME JUST TELL YOU ABOUT RUSSIA. RUSSIA USED TO BE A THING CALLED THE SOVIET UNION. BECAUSE OF AFGHANISTAN, THEY WENT BANKRUPT. THEY BECAME RUSSIA. JUST SO YOU DO UNDERSTAND, OKAY? THE LAST THING THAT RUSSIA WANTS TO DO IS GET TOO MUCH INVOLVED WITH AFGHANISTAN. THEY TRIED THAT ONCE. IT DIDN\\'T WORK OUT TOO WELL -- >> LAST QUESTION ON THIS SUBJECT. >> AND, BY THE WAY, WE\\'RE LARGELY OUT OF AFGHANISTAN, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. >> WELL -- WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. THE U.S. TROOP LEVEL IN AFGHANISTAN RIGHT NOW IS ROUGHLY THE SAME AS IT WAS WHEN YOU -- >> NO, YOU\\'RE WRONG. NO. >> MR. PRESIDENT, I\\'M SORRY. WE HAVE TO -- >> OKAY, ARE YOU READY? >> NO, NO. I -- >> WE\\'LL BE DOWN IN A VERY SHORT -- IT\\'S ALREADY PLANNED. >> WELL, THAT\\'S -- THAT\\'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION -- >> LET ME EXPLAIN. WE\\'LL BE DOWN IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO 8,000. THEN WE\\'RE GOING TO BE DOWN TO 4,000. WE\\'RE NEGOTIATING RIGHT NOW. WE\\'VE BEEN THERE FOR 19 YEARS. >> I KNOW. I KNOW. >> 19 YEARS. >> BUT IF YOU JUST LET ME FINISH MY QUESTION -- >> WE\\'LL BE GETTING OUT. >> I UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU CAME IN, IT WAS 8,800. YOU BOOSTED TO 14,000. AND NOW, YOU\\'RE BACK DOWN TO 8,500. >> WE\\'RE NOW -- >> MY QUESTION TO YOU -- >> WE\\'LL BE AT 4,000. I\\'LL GIVE YOU -- >> WHEN? >> THE EXACT -- VERY SOON. VERY SOON. >> WHAT WILL BE THE -- VERY SOON, 4,000? >> VERY SOON. YEAH, VERY SOON -- >> LIKE, HOW SOON? >> I DON\\'T WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. I DON\\'T WANT TO TELL YOU THAT -- >> IT\\'S BIG NEWS. >> WHAT IS? THAT -- THAT IS? I DON\\'T THINK -- >> GOING DOWN TO 4,000. >> IT\\'S BIG NEWS. NO, I\\'VE ALWAYS SAID -- >> WELL, WHAT ABOUT -- >> WE\\'RE GOING TO GET -- >> WHAT ABOUT ELECTION DAY? >> WE WILL GET LARGELY OUT. >> ON ELECTION DAY, HOW MANY AMERICAN TROOPS WILL BE IN AFGHANISTAN? >> PROBABLY ANYWHERE FROM 4,000 TO 5,000. >> THAT\\'S ALMOST AS MANY AS WHEN YOU CAME INTO OFFICE. >> NO, IT\\'S NOT. WE HAD -- >> 8,000 WHEN YOU CAME IN -- >> WE HAD MUCH MORE. WE HAD A LOTTA PEOPLE OVER THERE, TOO. >> 8,800. >> A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND WE DID A GOOD JOB. WE WIPED OUT ISIS. LET ME JUST -- >> HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT -- >> TELL YOU SOMETHING. >> GOING DOWN TO ZERO -- >> LET ME JUST TELL YOU WHAT YOU DON\\'T SAY. WE TOOK OUT -- IN SYRIA, WE TOOK OUT ISIS. 100% OF THE CALIPHATE. WHEN I TOOK OVER, OBAMA, IT WAS TOTALLY RAMPANT. ISIS WAS -- >> RIGHT. >> ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE TOOK THEM OUT. WE CAPTURED THEM. WE KILLED THEM. 100%. NOT 99% -- >> RIGHT. >> I WANTED TO GET OUT AT 99% -- >> RIGHT. >> EVERYONE SAID, \"OH, PLEASE, WOULD YOU STAY?\" I STAYED. 99% WAS GOOD, BUT 100% OF THE CALIPHATE. WE TOOK OUT SOLEIMANI. >> YEAH. YEP. >> WE TOOK OUT AL-BAGHDADI. >> YEP. >> WE TOOK OUT PEOPLE THAT NOBODY THOUGHT POSSIBLE. AL-BAGHDADI WAS THE BIGGEST TERRORIST OF THEM ALL. THEY COULDN\\'T FIND HIM. I TOOK HIM OUT. SOLEIMANI, EVEN BIGGER. I TOOK HIM OUT. I\\'VE DONE THINGS THAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT\\'S DONE. NONE -- I MEAN, FORTUNATELY NOT TOO MANY. THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE DECISION TO GO TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND GET INTO THE MIDDLE EAST WAS THE SINGLE BIGGEST MISTAKE MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT\\'S MY OPINION. >> YOU TOLD FOX NEWS RECENTLY THAT YOU COULDN\\'T SAY WHETHER YOU\\'D ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE 2020 ELECTION. WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE AS THE SITTING PRESIDENT? I MEAN, IT\\'S UNPRECEDENTED. >> WELL -- >> WHAT WOULD THAT ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE? >> HILLARY CLINTON NEVER ACCEPTED THEM -- >> SHE -- SHE CONCEDED ON -- >> I MEAN, SHE WENT TOTALLY -- >> SHE CONCEDED ON -- >> SHE STILL DOESN\\'T ACCEPT THEM, AND SHE GOT BEATEN -- >> THAT\\'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. >> VERY EASILY. >> THAT\\'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. SHE CONCEDED ON ELECTION NIGHT. NOW, SHE GRUMBLED ABOUT IT AND SAID -- >> GRUMBLED? >> ALL SORTS OF -- >> GRUMBLED? SHE WROTE -- >> OKAY, FINE. >> BOOKS ABOUT IT. >> SHE WROTE BOOKS -- >> DON\\'T USE THE WORD \"GRUMBLED.\" >> FINE. BUT -- >> SHE WROTE BOOKS ABOUT IT. >> THAT\\'S FINE, BUT I JUST -- >> AND SHE GOT BEATEN EASILY. >> I GET IT. I GET IT. >> 306 TO 223. >> I\\'M NOT -- >> THAT\\'S A LOT. >> DISPUTING YOU BEAT HILLARY CLINTON -- >> OKAY, THAT\\'S A LOT. >> LISTEN. WHAT I\\'M ASKING IS, YOU\\'RE -- YOU\\'LL BE THE SITTING PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IF YOU DON\\'T ACCEPT IT -- >> I\\'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. >> ARE YOU LITIGATING -- >> I\\'LL -- LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE -- >> OKAY. >> SO WE HAVE A NEW PHENOMENON. IT\\'S CALLED AN -- IT\\'S CALLED MAIL-IN VOTING, WHERE YOU SEND -- WHERE A GOVERNOR -- >> NEW? >> WELL -- >> IT\\'S BEEN USED SINCE THE CIVIL WAR -- >> IT\\'S NEW IN TERMS OF THE -- >> RECORDS OF -- >> THE KIND OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF BALLOTS. THEY\\'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING -- >> IT\\'LL BE -- >> LIKE THIS. >> BIGGER THIS YEAR \\'CAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC -- >> BIGGER? NOT BIGGER. MASSIVELY BIGGER. >> YEAH, \\'CAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC -- >> SO THEY\\'RE GOING TO SEND TENS OF MILLIONS OF BALLOTS TO CALIFORNIA, ALL OVER THE PLACE. WHO -- WHO\\'S GOING TO GET THEM? I HAVE A FRIEND, LIVES IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY -- >> THEY SEND APPLICATIONS -- >> HIS SON PASSED AWAY. HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL SON. YOUNG MAN. PASSED AWAY SEVEN YEARS AGO. HE CALLED ME. HE SAID, \"I JUST GOT A -- I JUST GOT A BALLOT\" -- >> PROBABLY AN APPLICATION. >> \"FOR MY SON ROBERT.\" >> PROBABLY -- >> HE DIED SEVEN YEARS AGO. SOMEBODY GOT A BALLOT FOR A DOG. SOMEBODY GOT A BALLOT FOR SOMETHING ELSE. YOU GOT MILLIONS OF BALLOTS GOING. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHERE THEY\\'RE GOING. YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE CORRUPTION HAVING TO DO WITH UNIVERSAL MAIL-IN VOTING. ABSENTEE VOTING IS OKAY. YOU HAVE TO APPLY. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS. >> YOU HAVE TO APPLY FOR MAIL-IN -- >> ABSENTEE VOTING IS GOOD -- >> IT\\'S THE SAME THING. >> LOOK. >> LOOK, LET\\'S DO CONCRETE -- >> THEY\\'RE SENDING OUT -- >> LET\\'S DO CONCRETE -- >> JONATHAN, THEY\\'RE SENDING OUT -- >> APPLICATIONS. >> GOVERNORS -- MILLIONS OF BALLOTS. >> NO, THEY\\'RE NOT. >> THERE IS -- >> IT\\'S APPLICATIONS. YOU CAN GET THEM OFF THE INTERNET -- >> THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN GO THROUGH A MAIL-IN VOTE WITHOUT MASSIVE CHEATING. >> I HONESTLY DON\\'T UNDERSTAND THIS TOPIC WITH -- WITH YOU -- >> GO AHEAD. >> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS AN EXTREMELY WELL-FUNDED VOTE-BY-MAIL PROGRAM. YOUR CAMPAIGN PUTS OUT EMAILS TELLING PEOPLE TO VOTE BY MAIL. >> CORRECT. >> YOUR DAUGHTER-IN-LAW, LARA TRUMP, SHE ROBOCALLS IN CALIFORNIA, SAYING IT\\'S SAFE AND SECURE, MAIL-IN VOTING. >> LET ME TELL YOU -- >> THE REPUBLICAN WON -- >> WE HAVE NO CHOICE. >> THAT WAS AN ALL-MAIL-IN RACE. >> LET ME TELL YOU. YOU READY? >> YEAH. >> WE HAVE NO CHOICE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE -- BUT WE HAVE MANY COURT CASES THAT WE\\'RE WAITING. WE HAVE ONE FILED IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. WE HAVE MANY COURT CASES WHERE WE\\'RE TRYING TO END IT. WE WENT THROUGH WORLD WAR I, YOU WENT TO THE POLLS, YOU VOTED. WE WENT THROUGH WORLD WAR II, YOU WENT TO -- >> WE\\'VE HAD -- >> THE POLLS, YOU VOTED. >> WE\\'VE HAD MAIL-IN VOTING SINCE THE CIVIL WAR -- >> AND NOW BECAUSE OF THE CHINA VIRUS, WE\\'RE SUPPOSED TO STAY HOME -- SEND MILLIONS OF BALLOTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE A CASE WHERE THIS ELECTION WON\\'T BE DECIDED ON THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 3RD. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> THIS ELECTION COULD BE DECIDED -- >> WHAT\\'S WRONG WITH THAT? >> TWO MONTHS LATER. >> PROBABLY BE TWO MONTHS, BUT WHAT\\'S WRONG WITH A PROPER MAIL-IN COUNT -- >> IT COULD BE DECIDED MANY MONTHS LATER. >> HAVE YOU DISCUSSED IF -- >> YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE LOTS OF THINGS WILL HAPPEN DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. >> WELL -- >> ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TIGHT MARGINS, LOTS OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN. THERE\\'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. WHEN YOU TRY -- NOW, OF COURSE, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT. BUT WE\\'RE CHALLENGING IT -- >> OKAY. >> IN MANY COURTS, AS YOU KNOW -- >> YOU\\'RE GOING TO LITIGATE. >> ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. >> MR. PRESIDENT, THE OTHER DAY A REPORTER ASKED YOU ABOUT GHISLAINE MAXWELL. YOU SAID, QUOTE, \"I JUST WISH HER WELL, FRANKLY. I\\'VE MET HER NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE YEARS, ESPECIALLY SINCE I LIVED IN PALM BEACH. BUT I WISH HER WELL, WHATEVER IT IS.\" MR. PRESIDENT, GHISLAINE MAXWELL HAS BEEN ARRESTED ON ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING. WHY WOULD YOU WISH SUCH A PERSON WELL -- >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I DON\\'T KNOW THAT. BUT I DO KNOW THIS. >> SHE HAS. SHE\\'S BEEN ARRESTED FOR THAT. YOU KNOW THAT -- >> HER FRIEND OR BOYFRIEND -- >> EPSTEIN. >> WAS EITHER KILLED OR COMMITTED SUICIDE IN JAIL. SHE\\'S NOW IN JAIL. YEAH, I WISH HER WELL. I\\'D WISH YOU WELL. I\\'D WISH A LOT OF PEOPLE WELL. GOOD LUCK. LET THEM PROVE SOMEBODY WAS GUILTY. I MEAN, YOU -- DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE\\'S GUILTY -- >> OH, SO YOU\\'RE SAYING YOU HOPE SHE DOESN\\'T DIE IN JAIL? IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY WISH HER WELL -- >> WELL, HER BOYFRIEND DIED IN JAIL, AND PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN. WAS IT SUICIDE? WAS HE KILLED? AND I DO WISH HER WELL. I\\'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING BAD FOR HER. I\\'M NOT LOOKING BAD FOR ANYBODY. >> OKAY. >> AND THEY TOOK THAT AND THEY MADE IT SUCH -- >> I MEAN, SHE\\'S A CHILD SEX -- ALLEGED CHILD SEX TRAFFICKER. >> SUCH A BIG DEAL. BUT ALL IT IS, IS HER BOYFRIEND DIED. HE DIED IN JAIL. WAS HE KILLED? WAS IT SUICIDE? I DO. I WISH HER WELL. >> LET\\'S MOVE TO PORTLAND. I\\'M SURE YOU\\'VE SEEN THE DISTURBING FOOTAGE OF PEOPLE IN FATIGUES BEATING THE NAVY VETERAN -- >> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. NO. NO. >> WELL -- >> HERE YOU GO. >> IT\\'S THERE. >> THE FAKE NEWS. >> IT\\'S NOT FAKE NEWS. >> NO, NO. >> IT\\'S ON VIDEO. >> FOR 59 -- >> PEPPER SPRAYING HIM. >> DAYS, THESE PEOPLE WERE ANARCHISTS AND AGITATORS AND SOME PROTESTERS. BUT THESE WERE ANARCHISTS. >> OKAY? >> THESE PEOPLE WERE BEATING THE HELL OUT OF THE CITY. THEY WERE BEATING UP OUR FEDERAL BUILDINGS AND FEDERAL COURTHOUSE. WE TOLD THE POLICE TO STOP IT. \"YOU MAKE SURE.\" AND THE POLICE WOULDN\\'T DO IT. NOT THE POLICE. >> YOUR OWN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND HOMELAND SECURITY INSPECTOR GENERALS -- >> EXCUSE ME. >> BUT YOUR INSPECTOR GENERALS ARE -- ARE INVESTIGATING -- >> EXCUSE ME. >> UNCONSTITUTION -- >> YOU\\'RE TRYING NOW TO BLAME LAW ENFORCEMENT INSTEAD OF ANARCHISTS. >> I\\'M NOT. >> INSTEAD OF ANTIFA. >> I\\'M NOT. >> IT\\'S ANTIFA AND ANARCHISTS THAT ARE CAUSING THE PROBLEMS, NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT -- IF WE DIDN\\'T HAVE PEOPLE AT OUR COURTHOUSE -- AND THEY\\'RE STRONG, TOUGH PEOPLE. AND THEY DON\\'T WANT -- THEY TRY AND BE VERY GOOD. BELIEVE ME. BUT IF WE DIDN\\'T HAVE PEOPLE THERE, YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR FEDERAL COURTHOUSE, $600 MILLION BUILDING, YOU WOULD HAVE THAT THING BURNED TO THE GROUND RIGHT NOW -- >> I\\'M ASKING YOU ABOUT TACTICS AND ABOUT THE UNMARKED VANS WHERE THEY\\'RE ROUNDING PEOPLE UP. AND I WANT -- I WANT -- >> OKAY, LET ME TELL YOU -- LET ME TELL YOU -- >> CAN I JUST FINISH MY QUESTION? CAN I -- >> ABOUT UNMARKED. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT UNMARKED -- >> COULD I JUST FINISH MY QUESTION? \\'CAUSE IT RELATES TO THIS, I PROMISE. THIS IS FROM RAND PAUL. QUOTE, \"WE CANNOT GIVE UP LIBERTY FOR SECURITY. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN AND SHOULD BE HANDLING THESE SITUATIONS IN OUR CITIES, BUT THERE IS NO PLACE FOR FEDERAL TROOPS OR UNIDENTIFIED FEDERAL AGENTS ROUNDING PEOPLE UP AT WILL.\" WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO SENATOR PAUL? >> FIRST OF ALL, THESE ARE HOMELAND SECURITY PEOPLE. THEY\\'RE SECURING A COURTHOUSE. >> THEY\\'RE BORDER PATROL. >> THEY\\'RE HOMELAND SECURITY. >> ELITE UNITS. >> BORDER. HOPEFULLY, THEY HAVE I.C.E. IN THERE -- >> CAMO. >> HOPEFULLY THEY -- >> GAS MASKS. >> HAVE I.C.E. NOW, DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY\\'RE UNMARKED? BECAUSE -- >> WHY? >> THESE -- TERRORISTS, THESE ANTIFA PEOPLE, THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE ANARCHISTS AND AGITATORS, WHEN THEY SEE THE NAME ON A UNIFORM OF A -- OF A PERSON, A POLICEMAN OR LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSON, THEY FIND OUT WHERE THAT PERSON LIVES. AND THEN THEY GO AND THEY SCARE THE HELL OUT OF THE PERSON\\'S FAMILY. SO THEY DO IT FOR THAT REASON. IT\\'S JUST COMMON -- THERE\\'S NOTHING SECRET ABOUT THIS. AND YOU KNOW IT. YOU SEE WHAT\\'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE CHAD WOLF. THEY HAVE PEOPLE -- HE\\'S DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. HE\\'S THE ACTING HEAD. HE\\'S DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. CHAD WOLF HAS PICKETS OUT -- VERY DANGEROUS-LOOKING PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF HIS HOUSE. HE\\'S GOING TO BE JUST FINE. HE\\'S TOUGH AND HE\\'S GOT PEOPLE. BUT IF YOU HAVE THE NAMES ON ALL OF THESE UNIFORMS, YOU\\'LL HAVE THESE MANIACS IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSES -- SCARING THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR WIVES AND -- OR HUSBANDS, WHATEVER IT MAY BE. I THINK IT\\'S A VERY GOOD REASON NOT TO HAVE YOUR NAME. WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE IDENTIFICATION, \"MY NAME IS BILL SMITH, AND HERE\\'S WHERE I LIVE, AND I\\'M A MEMBER OF -- \" >> THE REALLY SERIOUS CONCERN IS REPORTS -- >> NO, NO, THAT\\'S A -- >> NO, NO. NOT ABOUT THAT -- >> THAT\\'S A SERIOUS CONCERN -- >> THE SERIOUS CONCERN IS THE REPORTS OF PEOPLE BEING ROUNDED UP AND NOT BEING TOLD WHY THEY\\'RE BEING DETAINED. THAT\\'S WHAT\\'S BEING INVESTIGATED BY -- >> WHY -- >> MR. PRESIDENT, THE INSPECTORS GENERALS -- >> WHY THEY\\'RE BEING DETAINED? >> THE INSPECTORS GENERALS -- >> YOU KNOW WHY? YOU KNOW WHY THEY\\'RE BEING DETAINED? WELL, YEAH, I MEAN -- >> THERE\\'S AN INVESTIGATION. DO YOU SUPPORT THAT INVESTIGATION? >> WELL, I HAVEN\\'T SEEN THE RESULT YET. >> BUT DO YOU SUPPORT THE -- >> LET ME SEE THE RESULT. >> THE INITIATIVE OF IT? >> NO, I THINK THAT ACTUALLY THE -- >> YOU DON\\'T? >> I THINK ANTIFA SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED, NOT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY\\'RE INVESTIGATING THINGS -- >> THEY SHOULDN\\'T BE INVESTIGATED? >> HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING TELEVISION? >> I HAVE. >> HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING THE VIOLENCE AND THE -- >> SURE. >> NOW, IF YOU WATCH NBC NEWS -- LIKE, I WATCH NBC FAKE NEWS.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU, SIR. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ so hello everybody thank you very much let me begin by sending america\\'s deepest sympathies to the people of lebanon where reports indicate that many many people were killed hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in beirut our prayers go out to all the victims and their families the united states stands ready to assist lebanon a very good relationship with the people of lebanon and we will be there to help it looks like a terrible attack i also want to provide the latest on tropical storm isis approximately 600 000 are without power along the east coast and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible i spoke to governor cooper i spoke to governor desantis and i spoke to all of the people at fema and they\\'re working very hard coastal areas and the storms path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents while inland areas could see flooding and very very high winds fema is responding to states that have requested the assistance we have a list of those states we can give them to you in a little while and my administration is monitoring the situation very closely we have uh the military on guard but we have uh fema is there in all cases corps of engineer is ready if needed the army corps of engineers very talented people i urge everyone in the storm\\'s path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your state and local authorities i now want to update you on the path forward having to do with the china virus before i do that i want to give you some numbers which are rather spectacular that just came out the manufacturing index of the institute for supply management that\\'s ism most of you know it by ism increased for the third month in a row rising nearly two points in july to 54.2 that was fantastic the highest reading since march of 2019 this is remarkable considering the survey was conducted throughout july and showed significant improvement despite the southwest in particular virus hot spots the ism measures and it\\'s a very strong measure of new orders rose five points in july to 61.5 and its highest uh reading that would be since september of 2018 that\\'s big number since the april low new orders are up over 34 points which is the largest increase in the history of the ism dating back all the way to 1948 so 34 points that\\'s the largest since 1948. similarly the ism\\'s measure of production is up 35 points from its april low to a reading of 62.1 which is the largest three-month gain in over 70 years at some some number these were somewhat surprising but i\\'ve been saying we\\'re doing well and those numbers are really spectacular automobile sales likewise are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the march low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up stunningly it\\'s 65 percent increase since then to 14.5 million units which is a a massive number the great strength and great news is really for states like in particular michigan and ohio south carolina pennsylvania very good florida a little bit these are great numbers record-setting numbers the strength in new car sales is also evident in the used-car market where soaring demand literally soaring demand is putting upward pressure on the used-car prices this is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry the need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector and we think very substantially based on the numbers we\\'re very very happy with these numbers and i think most people are anywhere from surprise to shocked by these numbers in a very positive way economy-wide inventories crashed at a near 320 billion dollar annualized rate last quarter crash in that case means a good thing not a bad thing that\\'s the largest drop ever on record ever homebuilder sentiment likewise is soaring as our home sale sentiment is now higher than last year in new homes recently made a 13-year high so we have a 13 year high in new home new home construction new business applications are very strong that just came out the widely followed atlanta fed gdp and that\\'s something that they have just come out with now forecasts the new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates it looks like it\\'s showing 20 annualized growth in the current quarter so 20 in the current quarter will take that all day long let\\'s see if that\\'s right that\\'s a projection so we\\'ll see if that\\'s right the atlanta fed very respected the virus back to that we are continuing to monitor and monitor particular hot spots across the south southwest and the west and we\\'re seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well actually especially to protect those who are most at risk which has really been our primary focus for ever since we\\'ve gotten to understand this horrible horrible plague that\\'s been unleashed in our country by china as of yesterday cases are declining in 70 of the jurisdictions compared to 36 percent last monday that\\'s a big big number 11 out of 13 states with the positive rate above 10 have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-july in other states the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always as strong even though the numbers are getting very good states that have a test positivity rate between five and ten percent and in the states with the lowest positivity rates we also see slight increases in daily cases and a couple of them we must ensure that these states did not become new flare-ups so we\\'re watching them very very closely fortunately thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths fatalities nationwide are that roughly half the level of the april peak so the death the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level one is too much one death because this should have never happened to us it should have been stopped it very easily by china in wuhan thanks to our major advances in treatment we\\'ve seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups compared to april mortality progressive strategy focused on protecting americans at highest risk as we race toward the development of a vaccine we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly and we\\'re doing that we\\'re doing that at a level that we\\'ve never even dreamt possible both with testing and with common sense and those with underlining conditions especially the elderly with the underlining whether it\\'s heart or diabetes they seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems while allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school where embers flare up we must engage immediately and that\\'s what we\\'re doing this is the science-based approach and that\\'s good with us working very hard on that an extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest risk populations while inflicting massive economic pain long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole so there won\\'t be lockdowns but we watch specific areas we\\'re very careful and we\\'re putting out embers we\\'re putting out flames when you look at what\\'s happening with miami and it\\'s going the numbers are going down but florida is going down very significantly texas and california are going down rather significantly on telemedicine as we discussed the last time as and as i said numerous times during this day it\\'s an incredible thing that\\'s happening a central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth so seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes and that\\'s what\\'s happening the number of medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14 000 a week to nearly 1.7 million so from 14 000 to 1.7 million per week in total 10 million medicare beneficiaries of excess telehealth services since the pandemic began that\\'s a tremendous thing that\\'s happened with telehealth as we shelter those at high risk we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks and you\\'ve read and seen what\\'s happened today today\\'s news was very exciting through operation warp speed we\\'re also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates and we\\'re determined to have a vaccine very quickly we think we\\'re going to have something very soon we have great companies these are the among the greatest companies in the world but right now they don\\'t like me so much because i\\'m forcing them to drop drug prices prescription drug prices very massively some of these companies are involved in that some of them aren\\'t we\\'re having a tremendous you\\'ll see a tremendous drop in price we\\'re using favorite nations we\\'re using the rebates we\\'re using everything so long i\\'ve heard about how well middlemen are they call them the middlemen and uh they are very wealthy nobody even knows who they are but they\\'re very wealthy people and we\\'re doing the rebates we\\'re doing purchases from other countries like canada which buys drugs for much less money than the united states is allowed to under a very bad system i don\\'t call it archaic i call it bad because it\\'s meant really for drug companies to get higher prices but under under the system of matching that we have if germany has a pill for 10 cents and ours is two dollars we\\'re allowed to say we want favorite nations and we want the pill for the same the same as the lowest country in the world if they sell to one country lower than anybody else that\\'s the price we\\'re going to get drug companies aren\\'t too happy about that big pharma we\\'ve also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies steroid treatments antivirals and other therapies to treat the illness today the nih we\\'re very exciting announced that they\\'re beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments which will take place in 40 cities across the country we\\'re going to move move very quickly results look very good already incredible results more than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway and we\\'ve secured five hundred thousand courses of treatment for rem deservier of remdessevier we\\'re really doing a job with it and it\\'s helping a lot of people that\\'s why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good relatively speaking that is but that\\'s for american hospitals through the month of september so we have room desevere at a very high level for hospitals through the month of september that\\'s big news the united states also is far and away the most robust testing capacity in the world testing has been incredible what we\\'ve been able to do nobody\\'s even close since march 12th we\\'ve increased daily testing by 32 000 how\\'s that 32 000 somebody would say that must be a typo it\\'s not a typo 32 000 we now conducted over 61 million tests nationwide averaging over 820 000 tests per day and nearly 5 million tests per week and now that we\\'re understanding the virus we\\'re understanding very much what we\\'re doing with respect to who it affects who it\\'s destroying and who gets away with it like young people very young people we\\'ll be having some interesting statements having to do with testing and focus testing i call it focus testing by comparison mexico so we\\'re doing numbers that are incredible but by comparison mexico as you know the president was here is a great guy but their their numbers are much different they do about 1 million tests france has done 2.9 million tests canada is around the 4 million mark australia is around the 4 million mark the united states is testing more people in a single week than in many cases uh large segments or large well-known countries all put together it\\'s been an amazing achievement the testing and the quality of the testing also and now we\\'re doing testing where you can have results in five minutes seven minutes and 15 minutes as opposed to waiting to come back from labs for it to come back from labs over the last several weeks hhs has opened surging testing sites in baton rouge new orleans phoenix miami jacksonville florida mcallen texas bakersfield california and this week we\\'re opening new surge sites in houston texas atlanta to date more than 130 000 tests have been conducted at these sites last week the fda also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual\\'s blood which is a big deal allowing us to learn more about the immune response fema and hhs has worked with the private sector to deliver more than we have new numbers more than 200 million n95 masks 855 million surgical masks 36 million goggles and face shields 364 million gowns and coveralls and 21 billion gloves billion can you believe that billion gloves and we distribute that to the governors different states and uh they\\'re when we get on the phone with them they\\'re very happy that i can tell you no no complaints from any of them they\\'re very very happy what they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons but they are very happy with the job we\\'ve done in our national stockpile we\\'ve tripled the number of n95 masks on hand to more than 40 million triple the number of gowns to 15 million and quadruple the number of ventilators to nearly 70 000. these numbers are growing every day and we\\'re now making thousands of ventilators many thousands of ventilators a month and we\\'re getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators they\\'re very hard to produce and very complicated machines so we\\'re we\\'re fully stocked here and we\\'ve made sure that every state is fully stocked but we\\'re getting them to a lot of countries that need help we\\'ll continue to work with the governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity protective equipment supplies and medicine i\\'m more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus and i want to thank you all for being here we\\'ll take a few questions uh yeah please i wanted to ask you about kodak you had a big announcement the other day about getting kodak into the pharmaceutical business but the sec is now investigating what happened can you say a word or two whether you think that there might have been some kind of a problem uh in terms of how those arrangements were made is there any grounds for concern from your perspective no i don\\'t know i wasn\\'t involved in the deal the concept of the deal is good but i\\'ll let you know we\\'ll we\\'ll do a little study on that we\\'ll find out if there\\'s if there is any problem we\\'ll let you know about it very quickly but i wasn\\'t involved in it it\\'s a big deal it\\'s a way of bringing back a great area to an addition to pharmaceuticals kodak has been a great name but obviously pretty much in a different business and so we\\'ll see what that\\'s all about but we\\'ll we\\'ll let you know very quickly yeah please um i just want to follow up before i ask a coronavirus question on lebanon you called this an attack uh are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident well it would seem like it based on the explosion i met with some of our great generals and they just seemed to feel that it was this was not a some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event this was a seems to be according to them they would know better than i would but they seem to think it was a attack it was a bomb of some kind yes interesting um and on coronavirus you\\'ve talked a lot about when you talk about the mortality rate the deaths as a proportion of cases which i understand that is significant when you look at how deadly the virus is or how good a country does that keeping people alive who get infected but when you\\'re talking about the scope of this virus when you look at the percentage of the population that\\'s died there\\'s only three countries that have more deaths than the us so how do you explain that that why the percentage of the population has died is so much higher in the us well i think actually the numbers are lower than others i\\'ll get back to you on that but we proportionately are lower than almost all countries we\\'re at the bottom of the list and we\\'re uh relative to cases also we\\'re at the bottom of the list which is a good thing being at the bottom of the list but i can get back to you we have about four or five different lists on that and we\\'re generally speaking at the very bottom of the list so i\\'ll get back to you when i look at the johns hopkins uh you know chronovirus resource center on their website it says the most affected countries when you look at deaths for a hundred thousand people the populations of how many people the population have died you have the uk peru chile and then the us um you know canada has eight thousand nine thousand deaths obviously they\\'re smaller than us but that\\'s only six percent of the population uh you know that there\\'s six percent of our total cases so why aren\\'t the deaths so much higher than the last of our numbers were based on the new york had a very tough time as you know new york new jersey that area and when you take them out uh just as an example take a look at florida relative to new york that\\'s not to say anything wrong with new york it\\'s just a very tough place people are close together it\\'s crowded it\\'s it\\'s not easy but when you take that out our numbers are among the lowest and even with it in i will get back to you but we have among the lowest numbers they\\'ve done a fantastic job on it yeah yes mr president i would like to ask a question about the election but one thing on unemployment first are you considering taking executive action to extend or rather reinstate the unemployment benefits that expired last week if congress can\\'t get a deal by the end of the week and as a general point what rate then would you want in there a percentage or flat rate we are looking at it we\\'re also looking at various other things that i\\'m allowed to do under the system and such as the payroll tax suspension and so we\\'re allowed to do things we\\'re talking with the democrats they seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the democrat-run states and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management i mean really bad management so that seems to be where they they\\'re looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by democrats in some cases radical left democrats that have not done a good job i appreciate today the wall street journal said very good things that we did a great job in portland by having our people go in homeland security chad wolfe and folks we went into portland and we\\'ve done a great job and they had that in an editorial that we that we really won that situation but we want the whole we we did save the courthouse the courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down it was in tremendous danger we went in we took care of it uh and we appreciated what the wall street journal said as far as the various uh things that i may or may not sign uh i i may not have to sign i mean progress is being made as you know very well in the hill we\\'ll see what happens but i have the right including the payroll tax suspension uh we may do some things we want to take care of the eviction problem people are being evicted very unfairly it\\'s not their fault it\\'s china\\'s fault it\\'s not their fault and people are being evicted and we can do that with an executive order so if we don\\'t get and we want to do it relatively quickly i mean even from the standpoint of covid uh people get evicted and then they go into shelters and there are thousands of people in the shelters and this is not a time you never want to be in a shelter but this is not a time to be in a shelter with a covet they catch it they get it and it\\'s no good so i may have to do something on evictions too because the democrats amazingly don\\'t want to do it we offer them short-term deals and we offer them lots of alternatives but so far the only thing they really want to do is bail out states that have been poorly managed by democrats okay and if i put on the election sir can i present trump on the uh the sale of tick-tock you\\'re basically arguing that the us government is going to collect a cut from a type of a transaction including two companies in which it doesn\\'t hold a stake in that\\'s unprecedented that\\'s never happened in u.s history before and the administration has offered very little explanation about how that\\'s going to work can you back your statement out and provide specifics about how you say that\\'s impressive did you actually use that term i said it\\'s unprecedented well it\\'s almost the same thing not quite i like it i like impressive i like it impressive not quite close uh so tic tac tic toc is very successful it does tremendous business in the united states people are riveted by it i mean i have many friends when they saw that announcement they\\'re calling i think their kids love it they don\\'t because they don\\'t get to see their kids anymore but they are it\\'s it\\'s an amazing thing whatever it may be and i told microsoft and frankly others if they want to do it if they make a deal for tick-tock whether it\\'s the 30 percent in the united states or the whole company i say it\\'s okay but if you do that we\\'re really making it possible because we\\'re letting you operate here so the united states treasury would have to benefit also not just the not just the sellers and i said inform very simple i mean we have we have all the cards because without us you can\\'t come into the united states it\\'s like if you\\'re a landlord you have a tenant the tenant\\'s business needs a rent it needs a lease and so what i said to them is whatever the price is a very big proportion of that price would have to go to the treasury of the united states and they understood that and actually they agreed with me i mean i think they agreed with me very much yeah please anybody thank you thank you so that deal may or may not happen we\\'ve given them until september 15th or so and we\\'ll see if we can have it and if there can be great security meaning the obvious security microsoft would be a company that would be good in that respect or approved in that respect at many levels including working with the department of defense and you know they\\'re very high level approvals so it would be good but there are other companies also yes well thank you sir have you or the anyone in the administration reached out to other companies aside from microsoft to see if they\\'re interested we\\'ve had other companies call us microsoft called me directly and we\\'ve had other companies call i don\\'t know where they are it sounds like microsoft is along the way of doing something uh i don\\'t blame them it\\'d be you know it\\'s a great company it\\'s really a great company but we cannot take the security risks of any of those companies including huawei which as you know we put a halt to but we can\\'t take the security risk i think our attitude on china has changed greatly since the china virus hit us i think it changed greatly it hit the world and it shouldn\\'t have they should have been able to stop it so uh we feel differently i just don\\'t know when you lose when you lose so many thousands of people and you know ultimately it\\'ll be millions of people around the world uh it\\'s a terrible thing that happened to the united states and europe and the entire world really a terrible thing yes please president i have two quick questions going on to fire someone on policing on the virus you said recently that there can be too much testing can you explain what the downside would be from testing too many americans to the virus and why you haven\\'t provided a date by which all americans might have the same kind of testing that we have here at the white house well we do more testing than anybody in the world as i explained and i don\\'t mean just a little bit if you look at india they\\'re at about 11 million and we\\'re at 61 million and there comes a point when you just you you want to focus your testing in a different way and we\\'ll be announcing some what we\\'ve done is incredible with the testing not only the testing not only the number of tests but also very importantly the quality of the test and the machinery itself to do the testing nobody thought it would be possible to get a 5 minute and a 15 minute result that\\'s a very accurate result and we do with abbott abbott laboratories has done a great job many of these companies have done an incredible job so we\\'re looking at that very strongly and we\\'re looking at uh doing something that if we do if we do it look right now what the testing is doing is helpful but we\\'re spending massive amounts of money and we want to have it we want to have a channel very accurately we want to be able to help the most people we can but we are testing at a level that no country in the world and i\\'ve spoken to the leaders of the world and they\\'ll ask me about it no country in the world thought it would be it\\'s even believable that we\\'re able to test so much 61 million versus you know most countries don\\'t even test you know when they test when somebody\\'s feeling badly if somebody\\'s feeling badly they\\'re symptomatic that\\'s when they test and that\\'s a big difference with us we go around and looking because if we find we find spots we find hot spots one problem is uh from the standpoint of uh the media we end up with far more cases than we would normally show so it\\'s you know as i called it the other day and a statement i said it\\'s called media gold you know for the media it\\'s gold but the truth is it\\'s uh we\\'ve done an incredible job in testing nobody in the world has done the job other leaders have told me the same thing they can\\'t believe we\\'re able to do it and and we will continue but we want to really be able to test very specifically the people that are in most danger most in need thank you mr president i wanted to ask you um first about what you tweeted out earlier today in regards to florida and your comfortableness as it relates to male and ballots for florida why does that apply to florida and it doesn\\'t apply to male invaliding across the country so florida\\'s got a great republican governor and it had a great republican governor it\\'s got ron desantis rick scott two great governors and over a long period of time they\\'ve been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally florida is different from other states i mean in nevada where you have a governor he said let\\'s just send out millions of ballots and the post office cannot be prepared i haven\\'t spoken to the post office about it but i don\\'t know how they could possibly be prepared florida has been working on this for years and they have a very good system of mail-in and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee so in the case of florida there aren\\'t too many people that would qualify they\\'re so well run florida\\'s a very well-run state low taxes low everything they\\'ve done a great job really a great job and the two governors between the both of them they\\'ve really got a great system of absentee ballots and even the even in the case of mail-in ballots the postal services are built up there you know it takes a long time when you look at the carolyn maloney election i think they and i\\'ll give you the story i think you have to do that election over that election is no good you have to take a look in new york they have thousands of ballots they don\\'t know what happened to them is there fraud is there it\\'s a disaster that\\'s only for a relatively small number of ballots but i think they have to do the election in new york over the times wrote a big story about it yesterday front page story it\\'s a disaster it\\'s a mess and they have to do that i think they have to do that election over nobody can know what the election result is so in the case of florida they\\'ve done a great job they\\'ve had tremendous success with it but they\\'ve been doing this over many years and they\\'ve made it really terrific so for florida you can mail in your ballots you don\\'t have to go in maybe a couple of other states they\\'ve worked out a system but this took years to do this doesn\\'t take weeks or months in the case of nevada they\\'re going to be voting in a matter of weeks and you can\\'t do that i can\\'t imagine the post office could do it all of a sudden they\\'re supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots but florida\\'s done a great job and we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in florida it\\'s going to matter thank you all very much thank you thank you what about in other states did you encourage voters in other states to request are looking at this 2020 showdown presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden has chosen california senator kamala harris as his running mate headed into november the two appearing for the first time yesterday and immediately aimed at the president over his handling of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic joining me right now is the president of the united states donald j trump right now mr president thank you so much for calling in this morning good thank you very much good morning it\\'s great to it\\'s great to have you here to get a reaction to what we\\'re seeing on the other side what is your reaction to kamala harris as joe biden\\'s running mate well she\\'s radical left now she tries to pretend she\\'s not but she\\'s the most liberal person in the u.s senate acknowledged to be she\\'s done things that are terrible in terms of the police in terms of the second amendment in terms of everything else and she uh is a big taxer as joe is a big taxer they want to tax four trillion dollars it\\'s going to be the biggest tax increase in history by far it will triple up records and they\\'re big taxers it\\'s uh just something that won\\'t work we\\'ll have you will see a depression likes of which you have never seen you have to go back to 1929 i guess it doesn\\'t get too much worse than that and you\\'ll just see that and frankly you know we\\'ve had a tremendous uh a tremendous market you and i have talked about that the stock market think of it we\\'re almost back to where we were and we\\'re still in the pandemic which will be going away as i say it\\'ll be going away they scream how can you say that i said because it\\'s going to be going away but you know we\\'re in the middle of a pandemic and yet we\\'re going to be hitting records i guess nasdaq already has many times like 14 times and the dow is you take a look at the numbers i see for the first time today it\\'s actually it\\'s actually down a few points i\\'m shocked almost shocked to see that but we\\'ve been going up i think we\\'re up 9 000 points 54 since march so somebody made a lot of money and i hope those 401k people didn\\'t do anything when it got down when it dipped because they\\'ll be very unhappy right now but if they stayed with trump they\\'re they\\'re very rich so i mean this market is trading higher i guess on the anticipation that the economy is going to come back in second half or in 2021 as well as of course these rock bottom interest rates do you have confidence that we are going to see a double-digit growth number in the second half what does 2021 look like in your view from an economic standpoint mr president so i think it depends on who wins i think if he wins you\\'re going to end up with a a disaster to be honest i see his plans the new green deal is something that the likes of which nobody can even comprehend it\\'s it\\'s like drawn by children it\\'s joined by children it\\'s so ridiculous okay you go over point over point and they\\'re actually serious about it i used to think they were playing games it was politics i don\\'t even think it\\'s good politics it\\'s so ridiculous but they\\'re talking about no fossil fuels which means basically no energy you\\'d have to close down half of the businesses of the country you have to rebuild cities because uh too much light gets through the windows so let\\'s make the windows nice and small let\\'s rip down the empire state building and replace it with a with no windows i mean the whole thing is so preposterous it\\'s so crazy and i guess you\\'re talking about a hundred trillion dollars right to do it assuming you did it you know which will never happen by the way but but i will tell you as well no airplanes let\\'s not get more than one car i\\'m sure the car business would love that let everyone get a car and live by it the cows you know i don\\'t know if they actually put the cows in you know they were getting hit very hard by the animal rights groups but they don\\'t want to have cows they don\\'t want to have any form of animals these people are crazy okay and this is uh this is what we\\'re getting and it\\'s amazing the way uh sleepy joe buys into it he buys into it like oh great you know he doesn\\'t know what he\\'s doing and now you have a sort of a mad woman i i call her because she was so angry and so such hatred with justice kavanaugh i mean i\\'ve never seen anything like it she was the angriest of the group and they were all angry they\\'re all radical left angry people and they\\'re angry because i beat them they still haven\\'t forgotten you know these are seriously ill people but if you look at if you look at you know her record is a terrible record and i\\'ll tell you a good poll because the real paul you know we\\'re doing very well on the polls and and you know they they love the suppression polls this is almost like a replay of four years ago and they said i was going to lose every swing state the day before he will lose every swing state it will be a very short evening right except i won every swing state every single one of them and and most of them pretty easily i mean you take a look at some of these swing states i want them easy and i got 306 remember they said the night before the election there is no way he gets to 270. yeah i didn\\'t i got to 306. in the uh electoral college so you know i mean it\\'s crazy these people it\\'s partly because you focused you focused on jobs and you made campaign promises to people about bringing the economy back which is exactly what happened after the tax legislation the deregulation and your policies around energy but mr president yesterday both biden and harris took shots at you saying look 40 million people are out of work he drove this economy in the into the ground what do you want to say to them knowing that before the coronavirus we were talking about the best economy uh any of us had seen or certainly in a generation but today\\'s numbers do not reflect that and they\\'ve got that to throw on you which is well they really don\\'t though because nobody\\'s buying it look we got hit by the china plague and we\\'re not going to forget it we got hit by the china plague i built the greatest economy in history greatest job numbers greatest stock market numbers greatest economic numbers nobody\\'s ever seen it i was i was cruising to election they weren\\'t even going to be a factor george washington would have had a hard time winning you know that it was we were cruising you had to see the numbers and it wasn\\'t even going to be a factor and the market was going to go through the roof because he is an overhang you know having joe biden is a big overhang even on the numbers that you put up every day that are so good there\\'s an overhang because if he got in the numbers would go down thousands of points if he ever won the election so it\\'s an overhang because certainly there\\'s a chance that could happen and that\\'s holding back that\\'s a headwind that\\'s holding back the market as believe it or not as good as the market\\'s been it\\'s up 50 since march as i guess 9 000 i think it\\'s yeah like 9 000 points you never saw anything like it just i\\'m talking about the new ones going up faster you\\'re right i\\'ll be doing it marie i\\'ll be doing it twice i will have rebuilt it twice but nobody blames me even even the radical left crazies out there this is the first time i\\'ve heard this attack nobody\\'s blaming me for the fact that the the you know the the uh call it whatever you want the china virus there\\'s you know there\\'s 20 names for it you have your pick of names right i call it generally the china virus came out of china should have never been allowed to happen but the fact is this plague came in and i closed it up saved millions of lives now we\\'re reopening and i don\\'t know if you saw yesterday but i put up charts that were incredible the the you talk about a v that\\'s like a super v and we\\'re coming back and coming back strong and my biggest headwind is biden because everyone knows that if biden gets in this market\\'s going to crash he\\'s going to build regulations and his taxes he\\'s going to tax people 4 trillion dollars 4 trillion that will destroy this economy the likes of which nobody\\'s ever seen before four trillion dollars in taxes so uh i don\\'t think you know the old days go ahead yep he is true in the old days when you were going to build mr president when you were a politician you talked about tax cuts you didn\\'t talk about tax increases i\\'ve never heard of a politician that got elected we are going to increase your taxes this guy\\'s going around and i\\'m not saying you know i\\'m not trying to i\\'ve never seen it before he got on television two days ago he says no we\\'re going with tax on chris and i\\'m looking around i\\'m going maybe we\\'re from a different school he is going to give not tax increases massive tax increases to pay for uh aoc\\'s plan aoc was a poor student at i mean i won\\'t say where she went to school it doesn\\'t matter this is not even a smart person other than she\\'s got a good line of stuff i mean she goes out and she she yaps these guys and they\\'re all afraid of her because if you notice all of these progressives are beating the regular democrats you know you look at elliot engel poor elliott engel he\\'s still going what happened what happened has anybody seen what happened what are the results he lost elliot he got wiped out that\\'s right these people are scaring and yeah and schumer\\'s gonna get beaten by her she\\'s gonna run against schumer and he knows that and he\\'s gonna get beaten by her unless he can talk her out of doing it he has no chance so you think he\\'ll get beaten this november oh chuck schumer will be in my opinion aoc will run against chuck schumer for the senate yeah i mean i think and i think she\\'ll win yes okay tell me about that because that\\'s another thing that they were complaining about you yesterday saying well he\\'s not there negotiating we want to get something done done the democrats have put on the table this three trillion dollar plan what specifically are they pushing for that is causing this breakdown in any deals nancy pelosi said that the democrats uh want to and the white house are still miles apart on on stimulus well they\\'re right and it\\'s their fault they want three and a half billion dollars for something that\\'ll turn out to be fraudulent that\\'s election money basically they want three and a half trillion billion dollars for the mail-in votes okay universal mail and ballots three and a half trips they want 25 billion billion for the post office now they need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots now in the meantime they aren\\'t getting there by the way those are just two items but if they don\\'t get those two items that means you can\\'t have universal mail-in voting because they\\'re not equipped to have it and you see how bad it\\'s been with this carolyn maloney scam she scammed her way into an election she probably lost but they said mail-in ballots it\\'s all mixed up patterson new jersey same thing yesterday virginia 500 000 applications for ballots got sent to everybody nobody even knows he got sent to dogs got sent to dead people nobody has no idea what happened they said oh we made a mistake i\\'m sorry 500 000 ballots sent in virginia how do you feel about virginia going in there and you have 500 000 phony ballot applications and this is all over there they want no no no that\\'s the only one holding up money for the american people they want mail-in votings and and they want money for the post office this is one of the sticking points that\\'s holding back stimulus for americans during this coronavirus running money for the post office for mail and voting that\\'s one of them that\\'s right how would you like to have maria how would you like to have three and a half billion dollars billion per million voting billion so if you didn\\'t have it you wouldn\\'t you know how much money that is nobody has any idea you know people there are three and a half billion they want 25 billion dollars for the post office because the post office is going to have to go to town to get these great ridiculous ballots in you know there\\'s nothing wrong with getting out and voting you get out and vote they voted during world war one and world war ii and they should have voter id because the democrats scammed the system but two of the items are the post office and the three and a half billion dollars for mail-in voting now if we don\\'t make a deal that means they don\\'t get the money that means they can\\'t have universal mail in voting they just can\\'t have it so you know sort of a crazy thing how many states will be doing those are two of the items but there are many more legislature but how many states are going to be doing mail-in voting mr president a.g barr told me that this opens the floodgates of fraud how many states are you expecting mail-in voting to take place in well you have california where they\\'re sending out tens of millions of ballots they have no idea where they\\'re going or maybe they do maybe they\\'ll go to everybody but republicans but they have california they have many states where you\\'re going to have now i will say it we\\'re challenging in court we\\'re challenging in court so it\\'s being challenged by at many different levels we have many lawsuits out there this will be the greatest fraud in history this will be the most fraudulent this will be almost as fraudulent as obama spying on my campaign but not quite this would be the greatest fraud in history well i\\'m going to get to that uh and then there\\'s the issue around federal ids you don\\'t even need an id in some places to actually vote you need an id for everything but they don\\'t want people to have identification to show that you are who you say you are when you go to vote it\\'s called voter id it\\'s the greatest thing there is everybody knows it some states like indiana some very well-run states have it but many don\\'t and the democrats are fighting it tooth and nail because they cheat there\\'s only one reason to fight it they cheat if you don\\'t cheat you want to have voter id but many people vote if you look at california we found over a million votes in los angeles over a million judicial watch did they were fantastic job they did tom fitton in that group they did a fantastic job that found over a million votes where people were over a hundred years old and they were voting they had people i think 124 years old that\\'s ridiculous it\\'s a terrible it\\'s a terrible thing that\\'s happened and the democrats don\\'t want to fix it miss mr president let me ask you about these tariffs because you\\'ve said that tariffs will remain in place for european union products despite efforts by airbus to move into compliance with the world trade organization what is this about the europeans are giving and subsidizing airbus you are keeping the amount of products subjects to counter measures unchanged seven and a half billion dollars of goods coming from europe well we won that in a lawsuit because they cheated the european union is almost as bad as china you know everybody doesn\\'t like it when i say that they say they\\'re our allies well they take advantage of us tremendously on nato you know they don\\'t pay their dues germany is delinquent for billions and billions and billions of dollars and we\\'re supposed to protect them and they they pay a lot of money to russia for oil and gas the pipeline they pay money to russia billions and billions of dollars and then we\\'re supposed to protect them from russia and on top of everything else they\\'re very delinquent they\\'re paying one percent they\\'re supposed to pay two and the real number should be four or five so uh we get it from every different corner now you know i caught it i\\'m wise to it and you have a lot of stupid people out there that say oh i\\'m not treating germany right i\\'m not being nice to france and you know they take it and by the way i\\'m very friendly with all the people and they know they smile at me when i look at them they said nobody\\'s ever nobody\\'s ever talked to us like you do you know i got nato to pay 400 billion dollars more a year my biggest fan in the world is secretary general stoltenberg of nato he says i can\\'t believe because we were going down every year for 20 years it was going down down down what they were paying for protection and i came in and it looks like a rocket ship up but still germany\\'s not paying anywhere near what they\\'re supposed to i use the word delinquent they\\'re delinquent they don\\'t pay yeah you you have also you have also changed the conversation on china sir i want to talk to you about that we\\'ve got trade talks slated to take place later this week beijing officials are saying that they plan to bring up your ban on american businesses conducting transactions with wechat and tick tock the journal is reporting this morning major corporations like apple disney walmart expressing concerns over wechat in particular mr president are you planning to narrow the ban tell us the threat around wechat and tick tock well we lose for many years 400 500 300 200 billion dollars a year billion with china dealing with china first of all before we even get into security it\\'s been a rip-off the likes of which the world has never seen and i charge massive terrorists and they pay us hundreds they paid us you know just tens of billions of dollars in terrorists as you know they targeted our farmers that i gave them i gave our farmers all of the money that they got targeted for was which was 28 billion dollars over a three-year period so i gave the money to the farmers that\\'s why the farmers love trump you know because i took care of them as opposed to other administrations that forget about the farmers but i took good care of them but i took it out of china now we\\'re getting right now under the trade deal people don\\'t know they said like schumer had no idea he was saying we don\\'t get tariffs anymore he he didn\\'t like tariffs don\\'t want to charge him all of a sudden he thought it was great because so much money comes into us but then he when i made the deal i left the tariffs on which nobody still understands how did i make the deal and still leave the tariffs on and they\\'re buying a lot of corn you know etc etc but with all of that my mindset has changed on china since they allowed the uh the plague to come in and have such a devastating effect on the world us and the world which is terrible but no i view china differently than i did it\\'s before plague and after plague uh right now i view china differently than i did before plague so we just spoke with jimmy ly he\\'s been on the front lines of the hong kong protest he spoke out about what he wants the u.s to to know about the communist party and he also took real issue with xi jinping being dictator for life here\\'s jimmy ly with me just 20 minutes ago sir listen to this it\\'s difficult for them to change you know especially when cjp is the is the president you know xi jinping is totally the motek term kind of hardcore communist he wants to bring china back to the mall time you know all the control right that he\\'s he\\'s is increasing is exactly the way that mao was controlling the country so mr president he\\'s talking about xi jinping as being the problem because he\\'s dictator for life wanting to take china back to the mao dynasty would you like to see xi jinping step down mr president look they\\'re running their country and we\\'re running our country and we have other countries that treat us very badly they treat us like children because we had uh foolish leadership i\\'m being nice when i use the word foolish but we\\'ve had very foolish leadership at the top at the presidential level and all of these countries from china to vietnam to all the asian countries and others many others have taken advantage of us we straightened it out with mexico and with canada we have the new usmca we were in the process of straightening it out with china and then the play came but even before that i had a complete deal with china and four days before it was going to be signed they broke it you know they broke the deal i had so i had to deal with them hong kong is a very complex problem because we\\'ve given tremendous amounts of money in the form of incentives to make hong kong free to make hong kong work and to our detriment so i have taken all that back all of those incentives that they had for the hong kong market in order to keep a certain amount of freedom over there knowing they have china looming over the top of them but all of those incentives billions and billions and billions of dollars i gave that we gave to hong kong i\\'ve taken back now because it\\'s hong kong is if you use a business term it\\'s owned by china so why should i give this to china hong kong can never succeed without those incentives and hong kong can never succeed having china as opposed to the thousands of geniuses that ran it having china run it so what does it mean for the united states in a very practical sense it means that our markets are going to make a lot more money they\\'re going to use the new york stock exchange they\\'re going to use nasdaq they\\'re going to use our markets uh and the the hong kong markets will go to hell nobody\\'s going to do business very few people are going to do business in hong kong anymore so we\\'ve taken it back and we are going to make billions and billions of dollars more because we\\'ve taken away all of these very expensive incentives we gave that to them and i fully understood it and i i still understand i was okay with it but once china got aggressive and took it over i took everything back everything\\'s back now and it will fail but look how aggressive they are in america look at how aggressive they are in america able to get insiders at corporations whether it\\'s harvard and the head of the chemistry department cleveland clinic houston consulate getting insiders in corporations to steal intellectual property and send it back to the ccp what happens if microsoft acquires tick tock how many tick tock employees will be working for microsoft and able to send data back to the ccp will you allow microsoft to acquire tick tock so first of all the first thing you know we have got those people and they\\'re being prosecuted under this administration they\\'re being prosecuted number one number two tick tock i broke the deal i said you can\\'t do business in the united states i also said to huawei you can\\'t do business in the united states and i told our so-called allies that are all over the world all of which you know for the most part take advantage of us we have good allies we have some very good allies but some are you know they take advantage of us because for so many years they were allowed to just absolutely rip us off but i\\'ve told them i said if you go with huawei that\\'s okay but we\\'re not going to be communicating having to do with intelligence because the intelligence goes right into beijing okay and we don\\'t want that and you know we know that and we have better scientists than they do we have better engineers than they do we know exactly what happened so we explained that to europe and others and for the most part they\\'re not buying huawei and if they do we\\'ll have to cut off intelligence because the intelligence we can\\'t have that go into beijing so we have there\\'s been nobody tougher to china or to russia or to anybody else than i have despite a media that\\'s bought out by china uh much more so than russia do you ever notice they always say russia russia russia they don\\'t mention china china china because most of these people like you look at the nba they\\'re bought off by china and china has you know the big pot of gold so they they say oh let\\'s go let\\'s use russia instead of china but china is a big problem and i\\'ve made it a much smaller problem the fact is that with hong kong we\\'re saving a massive amounts of billions of dollars and it\\'s not going to work it can\\'t work it\\'s all based on the dollar i\\'ve made the dollar stronger i made the dollar stronger to a point that there is almost no secondary currency the dollar is stronger now than it\\'s ever been and it will be even stronger in my second term and i don\\'t mean just from a price standpoint i\\'m talking about the pedigree of the dollar unless a biden gets in with his stupid taxes he wants to tax he\\'ll tax his country into a depression like in 1929 if you do what he wants to do his plan and i\\'ve been pretty good you have to say maria at predicting things i\\'ve been pretty good including saying i was going to win the election and i\\'m going to win it a second time by the way because you know one of the reasons i\\'m going to win a second time is people have made a fortune with me and they don\\'t want their 401ks going down by 75 80 or more and that\\'s what\\'s going to happen regulations and taxes he\\'s going to regulate everything put everything back times too i cut more regulations than any president we\\'re going to continue cutting back you talked about capital gains tax cuts you\\'ve talked about payroll tax cut you\\'ve talked about more deregulation what are the plans for the second term agenda mr president well i\\'ve done the payroll tax cut temper you know this is a temporary payroll tax cut but this is a very substantial positive jolt to the economy i\\'m going to do a capital gains tax cut to 15 in second term we\\'re going to get it down to 15 set 21. we get that down to 15 percent and i\\'ll get that done easily we\\'re going to take the house i believe we\\'re going to take back the house because nancy pelosi is stone cold crazy and i think we\\'re going to take the house and that\\'s upon uh you know i don\\'t make a statement like that uh very easily uh but we\\'re gonna take otherwise i\\'ll look very bad but we\\'re gonna take back the house we\\'re gonna hold the presidency and we\\'re fighting very hard in the senate i\\'ll be honest as the senate is uh uh is uh tough we have a couple of people that aren\\'t as supportive of trump as they should be and those people are going to lose their elections if they don\\'t support trump they lose their elections it\\'s a very simple element look at hagerty in tennessee he was a trump guy and he he just became or he will become very shortly the senator he won the primaries the other day you look at all of the things that have happened but the ones that don\\'t support and i\\'m just talking take a look the ones that don\\'t support and you have a few people that want to be cute and i think they\\'re going to lose their elections and that\\'s a problem for the senate do you believe school choice will be an issue this upcoming election given the fact that we are in this shutdown and this yeah this is a big issue for minorities in particular well the uh the unions own biden he doesn\\'t even know it joe doesn\\'t even know he\\'s alive but the unions own biden they own the radical left they own pelosi and schumer and they they will do anything for the unions including destroy the future of our children and by the way the union workers i love them they\\'re going to have to work in schools there\\'s nothing more valuable than good teachers teachers are the whole the whole basis for everything i mean we need those teachers that\\'s a very important thing richard trumka was on the show last week mr president and i told him that the income uh the income gap was narrowing before the coronavirus i remember reporting on this because wages were going up so much and he said absolutely not it\\'s not true can you talk to us about what was taking place in terms of the income gap and wages before this coronavirus because i was communicating this just the other day to richard trumka and he said it\\'s not true look uh he totally controls nancy pelosi in fact what we did the usmca he had to sign off on it for her she wouldn\\'t do it unless he signed off and he\\'s a good guy but he\\'s a union guy you know he\\'s good but he\\'s a union guy he does what he can do but if you look at really what was happening before we were actually coming this country was coming together before china sent over the plague this country was coming together because of success somebody said what\\'s going to bring how can the country heal i said one word success and it was happening you know that it was happening we were getting closer people were calling me that i\\'m talking about democrats that were calling me and talking in a way that was very different from what it had been because we had the best employment numbers we had the best employment numbers we\\'ve ever had we had the best numbers we\\'ve ever had we had the best stock market numbers we\\'ve ever had which now looks like they\\'re going to be supplanted by what we have now if you can even believe that but we had the best success we\\'ve ever had and this country was coming together and then the plague hit us from china a gift from china and now we\\'re rebuilding it and it\\'s going up like a v like a rocket and you look at those numbers on automobiles all of this you\\'ve gotten so much done economic policy foreign policy naming judges and in the face of all of this resistance first you had the resistance from inside your own government you had the fbi working with the hillary clinton campaign she paid for the dossier they used it to help entrap your campaign then you had the media piling on then you had an impeachment trial with no crimes the uh articles of impeachment were abusive power and obstruction of congress then you had china throw the curve ball at you with the virus democrat mayors and governors refusing to stop crime and vandalism this is all your first term what was most surprising to you as you look toward this new election what was most difficult and most surprising for you in this last three and a half years mr president and by the way when they say abuse of power on impeachment there was a pho it was a phony fake impeachment it was a disgrace on a phone call there was an absolutely perfect phone call right i\\'m the only one to get impeached on a perfect phone call i like a perfect phone call and i get impeached because of the level of hatred but when they say abusive power the abuse of power is that i get everything done i\\'m going to have over 300 judges by the end of the first term nobody\\'s ever seen that before i\\'m going to have two supreme court judges justices and we\\'ll have literally over 300 judges including court of appeals we\\'ve done things that nobody\\'s ever done the tax cuts the regulation cuts uh anwar look at anwar they couldn\\'t get anwar done ronald reagan couldn\\'t get it done bush\\'s nobody could get it done and [Music] and i hope they\\'re not going to be politically correct and i hope they do what because the fact is this was president obama knew everything uh vice president biden as dumb as he may be he knew everything and everybody else knew everything maria and you know it and comey and brennan and clapper they all were terrible and they lied to congress and they put flynn they want to put flynn in jail and he didn\\'t lie because the fbi said he didn\\'t lie and we just found that out you know it was only muller that said he lied and they said he didn\\'t lie and they\\'re putting they\\'re trying to destroy that man\\'s life and other people that got in trouble that did nothing by comparison and not in many cases nothing or nothing in comparison they spied on my campaign which is treason they spied both before and after i won think of that using the intelligence apparatus of the united states to take down a president a legally elected president a duly elected president of the united states it\\'s the single biggest political crime in the history of our country and i hope they\\'re doing a job i hope they\\'re not going to be politically correct and say well you know we want to go just get let\\'s get the lower guys that forged the documents going into fisa let\\'s just get a couple of the lower guys i hope they\\'re not going to be bill barr can go down as the greatest attorney general in the history of our country or he can go down as just an average guy it depends on what\\'s going to happen do you want to see a special counsel put in place to ensure that the american people find out what took place here we know that there was an fbi agent who actually changed documents changed evidence we know that there was lying to the court lying to the congress leaking to the media what if if you do not win in november we\\'re not going to hear another word about this so should aj barr probably spend they\\'ll probably cancel it definitely they\\'ll probably cancel it out almost definitely and it\\'s a shame it\\'s a shame but we caught him look we caught him carter page they just used him to spy on the campaign others they used to spy in the campaign it\\'s a disgrace and it could either be unbelievable they don\\'t need a special counsel first of all they have a special counsel working and they have durham working so they don\\'t need another special counsel we\\'ve had enough special counsels and frankly everybody knows if you didn\\'t have one bit of evidence from what you already know from reading the newspapers they\\'re all guilty as hell the insurance policy where in case she loses we\\'ve got an insurance policy we\\'re going to go and take them out you know that that\\'s what that meant uh with that was with strzok and paige the two lovers the two great lovers that got caught i hope everybody do you think the mueller report was the mueller investigation just a cover-up for what they had done because the mueller investigation we\\'re getting all of the documents now where we\\'re getting this declassification of documents and so we know oh yes they lied to the senate oh yes they lied to the fisa court all of this stuff was available when mueller was doing the investigation so how come he didn\\'t unearth any of this was that just an opportunity to just have all of the documents frozen as a cover-up for what they did to you because they were only interested anything having to do with trump even though they knew all of this stuff strzok and page their text message were all deleted by mueller mueller went in himself and he lied to congress because he said he didn\\'t apply for a job to head the fbi and he did and we have absolute proof of that he came in looking to run the fbi early on the following day he was given the job as the special prosecutor i call it prosecutor because it\\'s not a council they say special counsel it\\'s really a prosecutor so he was given the justice i want to be more accurate and with all of that that they did think of it they spent 48 million dollars plus you don\\'t even know what they spent looked at everything they looked at my taxes i\\'m sure they looked at everything with all of that no collusion i have a friend who\\'s a very sophisticated man one of the most successful people you know very well he said you have to be the most honest person in the world to escape the greatest witch hunt ever perpetrated in the history of our country to go over every document every phone call everything you\\'ve ever done and they say no collusion i did nothing wrong they said i never knew you were that honest he said you must be the most honest man in the world and so then they take it down and they send it to new york well listen we couldn\\'t find anything let\\'s send it into new york into the democrat lions den so they play games there for years it\\'s a disgrace what\\'s going on in this country we\\'ve got to stop it we\\'ve got to stop it and we\\'re getting close but mr president we know that the f the fbi lied to the senate in february of 2008 christopher wray was running the fbi mr president is christopher wray hiding all of this stuff and protecting the fbi should he step down so christopher ray was put there we have an election coming up i wish he was more forthcoming he certainly hasn\\'t been there are documents that they want to get and that we have said we want to get we\\'re going to find out if he\\'s going to give those documents but certainly he\\'s been very very protective he was put there for good reason he was chosen by a certain person and i said go ahead put whoever you want i\\'m so honest that i said you could put anybody you want let\\'s see how ray turns out he\\'s going to either turn out one way or the other but i\\'ll tell you bill barr all right and durham have a chance to be bill barr is a chance to be the greatest of all time but if he wants to be politically correct he\\'ll be just another guy because he knows all the answers he knows what they have and it goes right to obama and it goes right to biden they had the meetings that was one meeting they had many meetings that\\'s right we have it all on a timeline right here and mr president i know that we\\'re going to be wrapping up soon but i just want to get your take on these debates there\\'s this movement now in the media trying to get joe biden to not debate you and then you announced yesterday initiatives to help get kids back to school if you could just touch on these two topics before we wrap up here sir first off are you planning these are are we going to have a debate you invited well i want a debate i would say the only problem with the debates is we should have one debate move it forward to have an extra one i don\\'t care three debates is fine or make it four but we should have one before the ballots start going out these phony ballots you know they go out and we should have a debate before the ballots we have a debate a month after the ballots start going out so people are voting without seeing the debate so i think they should move one debate forward or have an extra one put it but i want to do the debates and they are trying to get out of the debates there\\'s no question about that united people that are very good at this stuff so am i i will and i will tell you they wanna they would love to get out of the debates unfortunately yes yeah well i mean look you\\'ve you have debated uh pretty aggressively in the past you\\'ve also announced yesterday initiatives to help get kids back in the classroom tell me about that this includes 125 million reusable masks go ahead i want to get the schools open they should be open the children if you look statistically it\\'s incredible how strong they are their immune systems they\\'re incredible we have to get our schools open we have to get our country open and a lot of the reason it\\'s not happening is because blue state governors if you take a look at some of the democrat governors they don\\'t want their state open because they think that hurts me on november 3rd and i think people are wise to it our country is going to be stronger than it\\'s ever been next year we\\'re gonna have one of the best years maybe as good as last year it\\'s incredible what\\'s happening when you look at the numbers on cars on on everything retail sales you look at the employment numbers we set a record we\\'re going up despite the democrats this is like i built the wall despite the democrats now nobody wants to talk about it anymore but despite the democrats they don\\'t talk about the wall anymore do you notice they used to talk about it now they don\\'t because it\\'s going to be completed very soon but despite the democrats we have a v going like nobody thought even possible they\\'re impossible they\\'re very difficult people i sometimes think they don\\'t love the country but they\\'re doing the wrong thing but in the meantime i do love your show and i think you\\'re fantastic mr president thank you so much for the time this morning thanks for your leadership sir we\\'ll be watching thank you sir thanks maria so hello everybody thank you very much let me begin by sending america\\'s deepest sympathies to the people of lebanon where reports indicate that many many people were killed hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in beirut our prayers go out to all the victims and their families the united states stands ready to assist lebanon a very good relationship with the people of lebanon and we will be there to help it looks like a terrible attack i also want to provide the latest on tropical storm isis approximately 600 000 are without power along the east coast and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible i spoke to governor cooper i spoke to governor desantis and i spoke to all of the people at fema and they\\'re working very hard coastal areas and the storms path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents while inland areas could see flooding and very very high winds fema is responding to states that have requested the assistance we have a list of those states we can give them to you in a little while and my administration is monitoring the situation very closely we have uh the military on guard but we have uh fema is there in all cases corps of engineer is ready if needed the army corps of engineers very talented people i urge everyone in the storm\\'s path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your state and local authorities i now want to update you on the path forward having to do with the china virus before i do that i want to give you some numbers which are rather spectacular that just came out the manufacturing index of the institute for supply management that\\'s ism most of you know it by ism increased for the third month in a row rising nearly two points in july to 54.2 that was fantastic the highest reading since march of 2019 this is remarkable considering the survey was conducted throughout july and showed significant improvement despite the southwest in particular virus hot spots the ism measures and it\\'s a very strong measure of new orders rose five points in july to 61.5 and its highest uh reading that would be since september of 2018 that\\'s big number since the april low new orders are up over 34 points which is the largest increase in the history of the ism dating back all the way to 1948 so 34 points that\\'s the largest since 1948. similarly the ism\\'s measure of production is up 35 points from its april low to a reading of 62.1 which is the largest three-month gain in over 70 years at some some number these were somewhat surprising but i\\'ve been saying we\\'re doing well and those numbers are really spectacular automobile sales likewise are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the march low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up stunningly it\\'s 65 percent increase since then to 14.5 million units which is a a massive number the great strength and great news is really for states like in particular michigan and ohio south carolina pennsylvania very good florida a little bit these are great numbers record-setting numbers the strength in new car sales is also evident in the used-car market where soaring demand literally soaring demand is putting upward pressure on the used-car prices this is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry the need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector and we think very substantially based on the numbers we\\'re very very happy with these numbers and i think most people are anywhere from surprise to shocked by these numbers in a very positive way economy-wide inventories crashed at a near 320 billion dollar annualized rate last quarter crash in that case means a good thing not a bad thing that\\'s the largest drop ever on record ever homebuilder sentiment likewise is soaring as our home sale sentiment is now higher than last year in new homes recently made a 13-year high so we have a 13 year high in new home new home construction new business applications are very strong that just came out the widely followed atlanta fed gdp and that\\'s something that they have just come out with now forecasts the new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates it looks like it\\'s showing 20 annualized growth in the current quarter so 20 in the current quarter will take that all day long let\\'s see if that\\'s right that\\'s a projection so we\\'ll see if that\\'s right the atlanta fed very respected the virus back to that we are continuing to monitor and monitor particular hot spots across the south southwest and the west and we\\'re seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well actually especially to protect those who are most at risk which has really been our primary focus for ever since we\\'ve gotten to understand this horrible horrible plague that\\'s been unleashed in our country by china as of yesterday cases are declining in 70 of the jurisdictions compared to 36 percent last monday that\\'s a big big number 11 out of 13 states with the positive rate above 10 have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-july in other states the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always as strong even though the numbers are getting very good states that have a test positivity rate between five and ten percent and in the states with the lowest positivity rates we also see slight increases in daily cases and a couple of them we must ensure that these states did not become new flare-ups so we\\'re watching them very very closely fortunately thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths fatalities nationwide are that roughly half the level of the april peak so the death the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level one is too much one death because this should have never happened to us it should have been stopped it very easily by china in wuhan thanks to our major advances in treatment we\\'ve seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups compared to april mortality progressive strategy focused on protecting americans at highest risk as we race toward the development of a vaccine we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly and we\\'re doing that we\\'re doing that at a level that we\\'ve never even dreamt possible both with testing and with common sense and those with underlining conditions especially the elderly with the underlining whether it\\'s heart or diabetes they seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems while allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school where embers flare up we must engage immediately and that\\'s what we\\'re doing this is the science-based approach and that\\'s good with us working very hard on that an extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest risk populations while inflicting massive economic pain long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole so there won\\'t be lockdowns but we watch specific areas we\\'re very careful and we\\'re putting out embers we\\'re putting out flames when you look at what\\'s happening with miami and it\\'s going the numbers are going down but florida is going down very significantly texas and california are going down rather significantly on telemedicine as we discussed the last time as and as i said numerous times during this day it\\'s an incredible thing that\\'s happening a central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth so seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes and that\\'s what\\'s happening the number of medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14 000 a week to nearly 1.7 million so from 14 000 to 1.7 million per week in total 10 million medicare beneficiaries of excess telehealth services since the pandemic began that\\'s a tremendous thing that\\'s happened with telehealth as we shelter those at high risk we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks and you\\'ve read and seen what\\'s happened today today\\'s news was very exciting through operation warp speed we\\'re also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates and we\\'re determined to have a vaccine very quickly we think we\\'re going to have something very soon we have great companies these are the among the greatest companies in the world but right now they don\\'t like me so much because i\\'m forcing them to drop drug prices prescription drug prices very massively some of these companies are involved in that some of them aren\\'t we\\'re having a tremendous you\\'ll see a tremendous drop in price we\\'re using favorite nations we\\'re using the rebates we\\'re using everything so long i\\'ve heard about how well middlemen are they call them the middlemen and uh they are very wealthy nobody even knows who they are but they\\'re very wealthy people and we\\'re doing the rebates we\\'re doing purchases from other countries like canada which buys drugs for much less money than the united states is allowed to under a very bad system i don\\'t call it archaic i call it bad because it\\'s meant really for drug companies to get higher prices but under under the system of matching that we have if germany has a pill for 10 cents and ours is two dollars we\\'re allowed to say we want favorite nations and we want the pill for the same the same as the lowest country in the world if they sell to one country lower than anybody else that\\'s the price we\\'re going to get drug companies aren\\'t too happy about that big pharma we\\'ve also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies steroid treatments antivirals and other therapies to treat the illness today the nih we\\'re very exciting announced that they\\'re beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments which will take place in 40 cities across the country we\\'re going to move move very quickly results look very good already incredible results more than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway and we\\'ve secured five hundred thousand courses of treatment for rem deservier of remdessevier we\\'re really doing a job with it and it\\'s helping a lot of people that\\'s why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good relatively speaking that is but that\\'s for american hospitals through the month of september so we have room desevere at a very high level for hospitals through the month of september that\\'s big news the united states also is far and away the most robust testing capacity in the world testing has been incredible what we\\'ve been able to do nobody\\'s even close since march 12th we\\'ve increased daily testing by 32 000 how\\'s that 32 000 somebody would say that must be a typo it\\'s not a typo 32 000 we now conducted over 61 million tests nationwide averaging over 820 000 tests per day and nearly 5 million tests per week and now that we\\'re understanding the virus we\\'re understanding very much what we\\'re doing with respect to who it affects who it\\'s destroying and who gets away with it like young people very young people we\\'ll be having some interesting statements having to do with testing and focus testing i call it focus testing by comparison mexico so we\\'re doing numbers that are incredible but by comparison mexico as you know the president was here is a great guy but their their numbers are much different they do about 1 million tests france has done 2.9 million tests canada is around the 4 million mark australia is around the 4 million mark the united states is testing more people in a single week than in many cases uh large segments or large well-known countries all put together it\\'s been an amazing achievement the testing and the quality of the testing also and now we\\'re doing testing where you can have results in five minutes seven minutes and 15 minutes as opposed to waiting to come back from labs for it to come back from labs over the last several weeks hhs has opened surging testing sites in baton rouge new orleans phoenix miami jacksonville florida mcallen texas bakersfield california and this week we\\'re opening new surge sites in houston texas atlanta to date more than 130 000 tests have been conducted at these sites last week the fda also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual\\'s blood which is a big deal allowing us to learn more about the immune response fema and hhs has worked with the private sector to deliver more than we have new numbers more than 200 million n95 masks 855 million surgical masks 36 million goggles and face shields 364 million gowns and coveralls and 21 billion gloves billion can you believe that billion gloves and we distribute that to the governors different states and uh they\\'re when we get on the phone with them they\\'re very happy that i can tell you no no complaints from any of them they\\'re very very happy what they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons but they are very happy with the job we\\'ve done in our national stockpile we\\'ve tripled the number of n95 masks on hand to more than 40 million triple the number of gowns to 15 million and quadruple the number of ventilators to nearly 70 000. these numbers are growing every day and we\\'re now making thousands of ventilators many thousands of ventilators a month and we\\'re getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators they\\'re very hard to produce and very complicated machines so we\\'re we\\'re fully stocked here and we\\'ve made sure that every state is fully stocked but we\\'re getting them to a lot of countries that need help we\\'ll continue to work with the governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity protective equipment supplies and medicine i\\'m more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus and i want to thank you all for being here we\\'ll take a few questions uh yeah please i wanted to ask you about kodak you had a big announcement the other day about getting kodak into the pharmaceutical business but the sec is now investigating what happened can you say a word or two whether you think that there might have been some kind of a problem uh in terms of how those arrangements were made is there any grounds for concern from your perspective no i don\\'t know i wasn\\'t involved in the deal the concept of the deal is good but i\\'ll let you know we\\'ll we\\'ll do a little study on that we\\'ll find out if there\\'s if there is any problem we\\'ll let you know about it very quickly but i wasn\\'t involved in it it\\'s a big deal it\\'s a way of bringing back a great area to an addition to pharmaceuticals kodak has been a great name but obviously pretty much in a different business and so we\\'ll see what that\\'s all about but we\\'ll we\\'ll let you know very quickly yeah please um i just want to follow up before i ask a coronavirus question on lebanon you called this an attack uh are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident well it would seem like it based on the explosion i met with some of our great generals and they just seemed to feel that it was this was not a some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event this was a seems to be according to them they would know better than i would but they seem to think it was a attack it was a bomb of some kind yes interesting um and on coronavirus you\\'ve talked a lot about when you talk about the mortality rate the deaths as a proportion of cases which i understand that is significant when you look at how deadly the virus is or how good a country does that keeping people alive who get infected but when you\\'re talking about the scope of this virus when you look at the percentage of the population that\\'s died there\\'s only three countries that have more deaths than the us so how do you explain that that why the percentage of the population has died is so much higher in the us well i think actually the numbers are lower than others i\\'ll get back to you on that but we proportionately are lower than almost all countries we\\'re at the bottom of the list and we\\'re uh relative to cases also we\\'re at the bottom of the list which is a good thing being at the bottom of the list but i can get back to you we have about four or five different lists on that and we\\'re generally speaking at the very bottom of the list so i\\'ll get back to you when i look at the johns hopkins uh you know chronovirus resource center on their website it says the most affected countries when you look at deaths for a hundred thousand people the populations of how many people the population have died you have the uk peru chile and then the us um you know canada has eight thousand nine thousand deaths obviously they\\'re smaller than us but that\\'s only six percent of the population uh you know that there\\'s six percent of our total cases so why aren\\'t the deaths so much higher than the last of our numbers were based on the new york had a very tough time as you know new york new jersey that area and when you take them out uh just as an example take a look at florida relative to new york that\\'s not to say anything wrong with new york it\\'s just a very tough place people are close together it\\'s crowded it\\'s it\\'s not easy but when you take that out our numbers are among the lowest and even with it in i will get back to you but we have among the lowest numbers they\\'ve done a fantastic job on it yeah yes mr president i would like to ask a question about the election but one thing on unemployment first are you considering taking executive action to extend or rather reinstate the unemployment benefits that expired last week if congress can\\'t get a deal by the end of the week and as a general point what rate then would you want in there a percentage or flat rate we are looking at it we\\'re also looking at various other things that i\\'m allowed to do under the system and such as the payroll tax suspension and so we\\'re allowed to do things we\\'re talking with the democrats they seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the democrat-run states and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management i mean really bad management so that seems to be where they they\\'re looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by democrats in some cases radical left democrats that have not done a good job i appreciate today the wall street journal said very good things that we did a great job in portland by having our people go in homeland security chad wolfe and folks we went into portland and we\\'ve done a great job and they had that in an editorial that we that we really won that situation but we want the whole we we did save the courthouse the courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down it was in tremendous danger we went in we took care of it uh and we appreciated what the wall street journal said as far as the various uh things that i may or may not sign uh i i may not have to sign i mean progress is being made as you know very well in the hill we\\'ll see what happens but i have the right including the payroll tax suspension uh we may do some things we want to take care of the eviction problem people are being evicted very unfairly it\\'s not their fault it\\'s china\\'s fault it\\'s not their fault and people are being evicted and we can do that with an executive order so if we don\\'t get and we want to do it relatively quickly i mean even from the standpoint of covid uh people get evicted and then they go into shelters and there are thousands of people in the shelters and this is not a time you never want to be in a shelter but this is not a time to be in a shelter with a covet they catch it they get it and it\\'s no good so i may have to do something on evictions too because the democrats amazingly don\\'t want to do it we offer them short-term deals and we offer them lots of alternatives but so far the only thing they really want to do is bail out states that have been poorly managed by democrats okay and if i put on the election sir can i present trump on the uh the sale of tick-tock you\\'re basically arguing that the us government is going to collect a cut from a type of a transaction including two companies in which it doesn\\'t hold a stake in that\\'s unprecedented that\\'s never happened in u.s history before and the administration has offered very little explanation about how that\\'s going to work can you back your statement out and provide specifics about how you say that\\'s impressive did you actually use that term i said it\\'s unprecedented well it\\'s almost the same thing not quite i like it i like impressive i like it impressive not quite close uh so tic tac tic toc is very successful it does tremendous business in the united states people are riveted by it i mean i have many friends when they saw that announcement they\\'re calling i think their kids love it they don\\'t because they don\\'t get to see their kids anymore but they are it\\'s it\\'s an amazing thing whatever it may be and i told microsoft and frankly others if they want to do it if they make a deal for tick-tock whether it\\'s the 30 percent in the united states or the whole company i say it\\'s okay but if you do that we\\'re really making it possible because we\\'re letting you operate here so the united states treasury would have to benefit also not just the not just the sellers and i said inform very simple i mean we have we have all the cards because without us you can\\'t come into the united states it\\'s like if you\\'re a landlord you have a tenant the tenant\\'s business needs a rent it needs a lease and so what i said to them is whatever the price is a very big proportion of that price would have to go to the treasury of the united states and they understood that and actually they agreed with me i mean i think they agreed with me very much yeah please anybody thank you thank you so that deal may or may not happen we\\'ve given them until september 15th or so and we\\'ll see if we can have it and if there can be great security meaning the obvious security microsoft would be a company that would be good in that respect or approved in that respect at many levels including working with the department of defense and you know they\\'re very high level approvals so it would be good but there are other companies also yes well thank you sir have you or the anyone in the administration reached out to other companies aside from microsoft to see if they\\'re interested we\\'ve had other companies call us microsoft called me directly and we\\'ve had other companies call i don\\'t know where they are it sounds like microsoft is along the way of doing something uh i don\\'t blame them it\\'d be you know it\\'s a great company it\\'s really a great company but we cannot take the security risks of any of those companies including huawei which as you know we put a halt to but we can\\'t take the security risk i think our attitude on china has changed greatly since the china virus hit us i think it changed greatly it hit the world and it shouldn\\'t have they should have been able to stop it so uh we feel differently i just don\\'t know when you lose when you lose so many thousands of people and you know ultimately it\\'ll be millions of people around the world uh it\\'s a terrible thing that happened to the united states and europe and the entire world really a terrible thing yes please president i have two quick questions going on to fire someone on policing on the virus you said recently that there can be too much testing can you explain what the downside would be from testing too many americans to the virus and why you haven\\'t provided a date by which all americans might have the same kind of testing that we have here at the white house well we do more testing than anybody in the world as i explained and i don\\'t mean just a little bit if you look at india they\\'re at about 11 million and we\\'re at 61 million and there comes a point when you just you you want to focus your testing in a different way and we\\'ll be announcing some what we\\'ve done is incredible with the testing not only the testing not only the number of tests but also very importantly the quality of the test and the machinery itself to do the testing nobody thought it would be possible to get a 5 minute and a 15 minute result that\\'s a very accurate result and we do with abbott abbott laboratories has done a great job many of these companies have done an incredible job so we\\'re looking at that very strongly and we\\'re looking at uh doing something that if we do if we do it look right now what the testing is doing is helpful but we\\'re spending massive amounts of money and we want to have it we want to have a channel very accurately we want to be able to help the most people we can but we are testing at a level that no country in the world and i\\'ve spoken to the leaders of the world and they\\'ll ask me about it no country in the world thought it would be it\\'s even believable that we\\'re able to test so much 61 million versus you know most countries don\\'t even test you know when they test when somebody\\'s feeling badly if somebody\\'s feeling badly they\\'re symptomatic that\\'s when they test and that\\'s a big difference with us we go around and looking because if we find we find spots we find hot spots one problem is uh from the standpoint of uh the media we end up with far more cases than we would normally show so it\\'s you know as i called it the other day and a statement i said it\\'s called media gold you know for the media it\\'s gold but the truth is it\\'s uh we\\'ve done an incredible job in testing nobody in the world has done the job other leaders have told me the same thing they can\\'t believe we\\'re able to do it and and we will continue but we want to really be able to test very specifically the people that are in most danger most in need thank you mr president i wanted to ask you um first about what you tweeted out earlier today in regards to florida and your comfortableness as it relates to male and ballots for florida why does that apply to florida and it doesn\\'t apply to male invaliding across the country so florida\\'s got a great republican governor and it had a great republican governor it\\'s got ron desantis rick scott two great governors and over a long period of time they\\'ve been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally florida is different from other states i mean in nevada where you have a governor he said let\\'s just send out millions of ballots and the post office cannot be prepared i haven\\'t spoken to the post office about it but i don\\'t know how they could possibly be prepared florida has been working on this for years and they have a very good system of mail-in and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee so in the case of florida there aren\\'t too many people that would qualify they\\'re so well run florida\\'s a very well-run state low taxes low everything they\\'ve done a great job really a great job and the two governors between the both of them they\\'ve really got a great system of absentee ballots and even the even in the case of mail-in ballots the postal services are built up there you know it takes a long time when you look at the carolyn maloney election i think they and i\\'ll give you the story i think you have to do that election over that election is no good you have to take a look in new york they have thousands of ballots they don\\'t know what happened to them is there fraud is there it\\'s a disaster that\\'s only for a relatively small number of ballots but i think they have to do the election in new york over the times wrote a big story about it yesterday front page story it\\'s a disaster it\\'s a mess and they have to do that i think they have to do that election over nobody can know what the election result is so in the case of florida they\\'ve done a great job they\\'ve had tremendous success with it but they\\'ve been doing this over many years and they\\'ve made it really terrific so for florida you can mail in your ballots you don\\'t have to go in maybe a couple of other states they\\'ve worked out a system but this took years to do this doesn\\'t take weeks or months in the case of nevada they\\'re going to be voting in a matter of weeks and you can\\'t do that i can\\'t imagine the post office could do it all of a sudden they\\'re supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots but florida\\'s done a great job and we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in florida it\\'s going to matter thank you all very much thank you thank you what about in other states did you encourage voters in other states to request me and i gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today cause there ain\\'t no doubt i love this land god bless the usa [Music] [Applause] from the lakes of minnesota to the hills of tennessee across the plains of texas from sea to shining sea from detroit down to houston and new york to valencia where there\\'s pride in every american heart and it\\'s time we stand and say [Music] god [Music] and i won\\'t forget the men who died who gave up next to you and defend her still today [Music] god oh thank you very much everybody thank you well thank you very much thank you very much and you know considering that we caught president obama and sleepy joe biden spying on our campaign treason will probably be entitled to another four more years after that [Applause] [Music] i want to thank you and art and brandon you\\'re incredible i know i\\'ve known you now a long time right from the beginning we had the chemistry we had that good chemistry i\\'ll sit down you know it\\'s 122 degrees in this place and we have our great governor governor can we make it a little bit just this is like a test you think joe biden could do this i don\\'t think so [Applause] so i\\'m thrilled to be in yuma arizona to proudly accept the endorsement of the national border patrol council that\\'s a big deal and they are they are great friends of mine and we\\'re building the wall we\\'ll be up to next week we\\'ll be up to 300 miles of incredible incredible and our numbers are the best we uh we are very uh tough at the border when people want to come in for our farmers etc etc we\\'re not going to hurt our farmers but we\\'ve never had better numbers than we have right now and that\\'s been helped because we\\'re at a little bit over 280 miles right now we have never been helped like this wall there are two things in a thousand years you can come back two things will never you know with technology it\\'s obsolete before you even put it in the box right but two things never get old wheels and walls right wheels in wall if you come back in a thousand years you\\'ll say well we still have wheels and walls and that\\'s the only thing you\\'ll recognize the national border patrol council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the united states border patrol they\\'ve been my friends from the beginning to every border agent and i just met some unbelievable people backstage these are great people and every family member here today you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation and i want to thank you very much thank you very much as you know better than anyone the survival of our nation is at stake in this election and i will tell you i never thought i\\'d say it because we had a great election we had a great election a little while ago four years ago i never thought i\\'d say anything could compete with 2016. this election that we\\'re going into is the most important election in the history of our country [Applause] because we had crooked hillary but this is something these people are sick and we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond because this is beyond socialism this isn\\'t so this is beyond socialism that it doesn\\'t happen or we will indeed have venezuela on steroids so we can\\'t do it most important election november third get out and vote joe biden is the puppet of the radical left-wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of america\\'s borders and boundaries they want to take the wall down they don\\'t want to have borders they want to have sanctuary cities lots of bad things they want following orders from his boss i guess his new boss is bernie sanders can you believe this crazy bernie joe biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement suspend all removals provide free government health care and and you know they want to give it to illegal aliens you don\\'t get it you don\\'t get it restore catch and release shield violent criminal aliens this is what they want to do and give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim and gain automatic admission into our country we will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before you get free education you get free health care why wouldn\\'t they come let\\'s go to america the biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen it\\'s crazy biden\\'s plan is the most radical extreme reckless dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate it must be defeated and it will be defeated on november 3rd it will be defeated [Applause] at last night\\'s democrat convention which by the way got very bad ratings i have to tell you unity they talk about unity they want to bring unity and then you listen to michelle obama\\'s speech which was obsolete by the time it got there she taped it no no she taped the speech it was obsolete she must have taped it about three weeks before she couldn\\'t even look number one i\\'d like to tape maybe i\\'ll tape i\\'m speaking next thursday maybe i\\'ll tape it but i don\\'t think that goes that\\'s so much nicer to tape it you do it nice air condition room and she not only taped it but tell me when you hear a divisive speech you know they talk about me as being a divider i\\'m not a i bring people together we were bringing people together we were bringing people together like never before success was bringing everyone together and then we got hit with the china virus but we were bringing people together but one of the opening speakers last night said that america will go to hell if we don\\'t have open borders think of that go to hell when a country doesn\\'t have borders you don\\'t have a country you don\\'t have a control today a democrat speaker at the convention said we\\'re talking about abolishing the police we\\'re talking about abolishing ice we\\'re talking about abolishing prisons biden\\'s campaign has turned into a cult for open border and other zealots by the way they want to double and triple your taxes they want to increase regulations they want to spend very little money on our vets and they want after we took care of our vets better than anyone\\'s 91 percent approval rating [Applause] and they want to spend much less on our military we\\'ve totally rebuilt two and a half trillion dollars we\\'ve totally rebuilt our military bernie sanders declared in his speech many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream that\\'s bernie sanders okay because joe look let\\'s he doesn\\'t know where he is but if he did he\\'s been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know it it will have problems it will go down your stocks will be gone your 401ks will disappear and right now who has a 401k all right and then the rest of you many of you have stocks and you do it a different way that will go down 50 60 70 80 and if you held on like i said to do we went down a little while when we got hit with the virus now nasdaq just broke an all-time record snp just broke at all time records socialism is the mainstream of the biden campaign and it\\'s not the mainstream of america remember i said we will never have a socialist country we will never have a socialist country [Applause] on november 3rd the people of arizona are great state we love arizona i won it last time by a lot [Applause] and i hear we\\'re going to win it by even more this time don\\'t forget last time i talked i said we\\'re going to give you your tax

going to want to have them play with your second amendment i\\'ll tell you what if i weren\\'t president i don\\'t believe doug you\\'d have a second amendment right now i don\\'t think you\\'d have

warriors paul garcia paul where\\'s paul paul stand up will you paul goes thank you paul appreciate it great job you\\'re doing these are warriors they really are when uh they went and they tried to

arizona jeff dewitt thank you jeff [Applause] and a man who didn\\'t choke under pressure i don\\'t even know if he\\'s here i think he might be here he never choked he kicked for 11 years you know what that is you ever see a golfer they miss a three footer they miss a three footer they can\\'t they can\\'t take it back they choke choke choke well kickers are the same right nfl kickers this guy lasted 11 years he\\'s one of the best kickers ever nfl kicker jay feely where\\'s jay where\\'s jay he\\'s here someplace where is he where jay what happened you couldn\\'t get a good seat jay i remember the 61 yarder that was a heartbreaker right but the only thing is i\\'ll bet you this man would stand only stand for our national anthem that\\'s one thing that\\'s one thing i can tell you and if they don\\'t stand for our flag if they don\\'t stand for our national anthem i turn off the game other than that i\\'d like to watch but i turn off again and by the way i thought they learned that lesson a little while ago i thought they learned that lesson two years ago but maybe not but they will they\\'ll learn it again it\\'ll take this time it\\'ll go even faster for decades washington politicians like biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate american jobs and wages also the crime was incredible what happened they allowed criminal gangs to menace maine and terrorize innocent citizens they came in they would maim and terrorize and we have done something with our border patrol and by the way ice ice is great ice has taken out thousands and thousands of ms-13 and you don\\'t want the job there\\'s some tough people here none of you want the job it\\'s a tough job but they like it and they\\'re great patriots and they\\'ve done a fantastic job they ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth this is what would happen they have seeded and what we\\'ve done did you ever notice the caravans what happened to the crowd what happened debbie there are no more caravans what happened what happened to the caravans they don\\'t come up anymore the caravans don\\'t come up you know we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to honduras guatemala el salvador hundreds of millions and i said well why are we doing that and they wouldn\\'t take when we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries they wouldn\\'t take them and they wouldn\\'t take them under the obama administration so we got stuck with them because they\\'d fly in they\\'d say don\\'t land your plane and i said something very simple i said that\\'s okay we don\\'t have to do that we\\'re not going to pay you any more we stopped payment [Applause] it\\'s amazing how that works doug right we stopped payment and they called they said we\\'d love to take him we\\'d be honored to thank so we take them back by the thousands by the thousands they let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities but no more it\\'s not happening anymore the cruel and heartless portrayal of the american people ended the day i took the oath of office and now that we have more than half of the wall built and you notice they don\\'t talk about the wall anymore they don\\'t talk why don\\'t you talk i went look at all those people back there that\\'s called fake news fake news look at them it\\'s the fake news they don\\'t talk about the wall anymore see we won we got the wall it\\'s going to be up to 300 next week and it\\'s going to be finished very soon and as soon as we won all of a sudden they never talk about it but you know where i talk about it numbers the numbers are so good the numbers are so low we\\'ve never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built you don\\'t get through it you can\\'t get through it you can climb mount everest and you\\'re gonna have an awful hard time getting over that sucker i stood up to the lobbyists everybody fought us the democrats everyone i fought the special interests i kept every single promise that i made and now i\\'m doing it with the drug companies i just created favored nations so if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price and they\\'re spending billion they\\'re spending so much they\\'re spending millions of dollars on advertising anytime you see an ad from a drug company they\\'re rich the farmer it\\'s called big pharma the number one lobbyist they spend millions and millions hundreds of millions of dollars online any time you see any time at all you see an ad by big farmer against me you know your drug prices are coming down that\\'s what it is they\\'re not happy and we\\'re giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middleman the rebate it\\'s going to the people now we\\'re bringing the rebate and it\\'s going to the people they are not happy i have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much but you\\'re going to get 50 you are going to get and the democrats would never do it biden would never do because he doesn\\'t understand it but they would never do it they would in a million years they wouldn\\'t do it it took a lot of guts to do it i had a lot of people a lot of good politicians go sir i don\\'t think you should do and i wonder why you\\'re saying that but we did it we\\'re going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time by not two percent and last year they went down a little bit first time in 51 years at drug prices went down but a little bit we\\'re going to have prices dropping 50 60 and even 70 percent gross about time and i\\'m proud to say that they\\'ve achieved the most secure border or border patrol in the history of the united states of america we now have the most secure border we\\'ve ever had and it\\'s only going to get better and we want people to come in but we want them to come in through merit right and we want people that are going to come in are going to love our country not hate our country here in yuma arizona we\\'ve invested over 1.7 billion dollars and poured 180 000 cubic yards that\\'s a lot of concrete to build 108 miles of powerful border world i know who\\'s going to vote for me i don\\'t know though i think i\\'m going to win yuma what do you think doug i think when i hear those numbers when we hear those numbers we\\'re winning we\\'re going to win you my big now you see it and you see what\\'s going up and it\\'s uh it\\'s an incredible structure all capable all wired up for cameras for everything you can have technology is incredible in total i\\'ve already completely planned for the final execution we\\'re going to have by the end of the year everything that we said is going to be built we may actually build some more in some soft areas that we\\'ve noticed over the last two years so we actually may put up some additional but we will have it completed everything we said by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible and we\\'ve reduced illegal border crossings by 60 since this time last year and if we keep going at the rate it\\'ll be about 85 in about two months so it\\'s a great honor and you know what your community is a much safer you see the difference it\\'s a much safer place to be but more important than these numbers is the fact that we\\'ve ended catch and release you know what cats are releasing these great men and women catch somebody maybe a murderer maybe a rapist maybe a trafficker they catch somebody take his name take his number and they release him into our country and they say come back in four years you have a trial no more we take them out we bring them out and nobody said that was possible because i couldn\\'t have gotten it through the democrats because they don\\'t like that so we have people coming in to this country some great people some really bad people too and i mean murderers and i mean rapists i mean really bad people and they don\\'t get in and they don\\'t get back when we bring them back to their country could be mexico also they don\\'t come back under the obama biden i call it oh biden under the obiden administration our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands and by the way mark morgan where\\'s the great mark morgan he\\'s around here someplace mark morgan has been so incredible one of our executives he said we never built the cages those cages were built in 2014 by obama okay we never built the cages they were built by obama and the fake news is constantly saying that i built cages for children i didn\\'t build them they were built in 2014. there was a headline in time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it they said he didn\\'t build them we built that for the obama administration but they don\\'t stop they keep calling it they say i built cages you\\'ll see you\\'ll hear it on one of the debates they\\'ll say you built cages president i said no i didn\\'t build cages that was built by obama under the trump administration if you cross our border illegally you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home we are proudly defending the job safety and security of the american people which is what i promised to do nobody told me it was going to be this hard nobody told me i was going to have the democrats go totally crazy this was like a life and death war you know why they don\\'t talk about it anymore because they know it\\'s bad politics because they know having a wall they can\\'t win that one so they just say let\\'s forget it ever happened because we won and they say let\\'s forget they don\\'t want to talk about it that includes the millions of incredible hispanic americans who follow our laws uplift our community and protect our nation in uniform half of all border patrol agents are hispanic americans i was just with them and today i salute each and every one of those true american heroes and that\\'s what they are and you know nobody understands the border better than hispanics they know what\\'s good what\\'s bad they don\\'t want bad people coming into our country taking their jobs taking their homes causing crime hispanic americans are the people that are most in favor of what we\\'re doing on the border can you because they understand it they understand it better than anybody with the help of these patriots we\\'ve stopped the rampant asylum fraud shut down the human smugglers and we\\'re finding the drug dealers traffickers predators and we\\'re throwing them to hell in jail or sending them back home ms-13 for the first time that you\\'ve ever seen this ms-13 is totally on the run many of its leaders are right now behind bars and we\\'re deporting its members in record numbers we\\'ve never reported i can\\'t believe how many there are [Applause] but if biden wins it will be a giant jailbreak for ms-13 and fishes criminal gangs china wants him to win so badly iran wants him to win so badly when we win i\\'ll have a deal with iran within a month watch because they\\'re dying to make a deal but that last hope that biden will win they will own our country china they will own our country we made such a great deal you know last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country the largest single order then they did it again you know why they\\'re doing that because they know i\\'m angry because they know i don\\'t care so much anymore we made a great trade deal but i don\\'t care but it shows you how smart they are doug another with normal normal brain power that say well i\\'m not going to buy any more corn because i don\\'t get a lot that\\'s good and we\\'ll just decouple thank you very much but they go the opposite they buy so much good record numbers soybeans record numbers the biggest last week biggest ever 42 percent of our farmers crop is now china over the last little while you know why because they don\\'t want bad things to happen that\\'s why so they\\'re very smart when i have every farmer in the country calling and saying you know please don\\'t do anything they\\'re very very smart but we can never forget what china did to this country and did to the world the historic achievements that i\\'ve discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we\\'ve all done together in the last four years here\\'s just a short list of our landmarks really they are landmarks true landmarks we instituted a national security travel ban on the world\\'s most dangerous regions including jihadist regions keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country everyone said oh that\\'s so bad remember when they said oh that\\'s so bad i don\\'t think it\\'s so bad at all we won the travel ban the fake news said we didn\\'t because we lost in the lower court we lost in the second court and we won in the supreme court so they said we lost can you believe they said we lost debbie because we lost the first two but we won in the supreme court so they said they lost i guess technically they\\'re right we lost what it didn\\'t matter but we haven\\'t we have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we don\\'t want the people coming in over the last three years ice officers have made over 380 000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of over 145 000 assaults 40 000 sex crimes and 5 800 murders [Applause] over the last three years border patrol and ice have seized over 2 million pounds of fentanyl heroin meth and other deadly narcotics and you see it all the time [Applause] we stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities they want to have a sanctuary city not going to be like the old days we cancelled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ice officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the united states of america we removed 20 000 gang members including 4 500 ms-13 that\\'s pretty good [Applause] who would ever think there\\'s that many i entered into three landmark agreements with honduras and el salvador and guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system we cut down that payment that i was talking about substantially and they\\'re still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes mexico right now mexico has 27 000 of their soldiers on our southern border helping us to guard our southern border [Applause] and we\\'re giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for that\\'s what we\\'ve done i entered into a historic partnership with mexico known as the migrant protection protocols to safely return asylum seekers to mexico while awaiting hearings in the united states you know about that we had to have them in the united states if we captured if we had to keep from here i said no no we don\\'t want them here we want them outside we got sued all over the place that we won so now they don\\'t come into the united states they can wait outside [Applause] for the first time ever the united states is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal we don\\'t have to go through years and years of litigation you need perry mason to try and when we ended the obama-biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving illegal aliens think of that one we established the national vetting center the most advanced visa screening system anywhere in the world we know so much about the people coming in we know the good and we know the bad we\\'ve suspended refugee resettlements from the world\\'s most dangerous regions because nothing is more important than keeping america safe to me it\\'s number one [Applause] we\\'ve made historic progress to crack down on visa overseas you know all about that they overstay for years they say maybe a night maybe two nights well five years later you catch them nope we ended it we issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals we have many countries beyond the four that i mentioned the three plus one many countries they all take them back now before they weren\\'t taken aback at all the last administration simply released these criminals we\\'re making sure they go home and we\\'re making sure they stay home we don\\'t want them we issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism do you know what that is right anchor babies you know that right anchor babies have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life congratulations you\\'re a citizen for 90 years and then you bring in your family you bring in your family right no no good i implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient they cannot accept welfare for at least five years to protect our country and our agents during the pandemic my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens we brought them back we have very few in our country now we brought them back can you believe it to protect u.s workers i suspended the entry of low-wage workers that threaten all of your jobs american jobs and we\\'re finalizing the new h-1b regulations to permanently end the displacement of u.s workers in january after the china vira after the outbreak after the outbreak the china virus outbreak it came from wuhan right i swiftly implemented a travel ban on china and i was criticized biden opposed the ban he said i opposed the ban he had no idea what the hell he was doing why do you oppose it joe i don\\'t know they told me to say that if we had listened to sleepy joe biden hundreds of thousands of additional american lives would have been lost we did a good thing that was in january i posted very early a month later pelosi and all these people said oh no let people come in we can\\'t we imposed it because china was heavily infected then i imposed it in europe also heavily infected with italy and france and spain compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that biden and bernie sanders want the entire biden harris how about her she a great one is she been by the way you talk about guns she wants no second amendment she wants to raise your taxes to a level you\\'ll be paying your government back for a long time she is not the right pick but she was my number one draft pick they asked me that what do you think i said i\\'m very happy they thought i was happy they thought i was happy for him no i was happy for me the biden harris plan is a step-by-step recipe for abolishing america\\'s borders in the biden bernie manifesto joe biden promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire u.s border you believe that we just got rid of it free all illegal aliens from federal detention and closed detention facilities this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible and you would have murderers killers rapists in your midst i don\\'t think so immediately suspend all removals triggering a tidal wave of really a flood if you think a flood all across our border end prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly re-enter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud they want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate now this is all simple and i really respect because so far i\\'ve only seen about four or five people go down because it is hot in here but i will tell you this i it\\'s 120. you know what i said before think of yourself at a great spa great sauna where it\\'s 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there you have to pay a lot of money getting off the border getting off illegal protection all of that we are going to lower your taxes further we gave you the biggest tax increase in the history of the biggest tax decrease in the history of our country we decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and we\\'re doing more because that\\'s going to spell growth and that\\'s what happened companies are moving in like nobody has seen before so we\\'re doing that massive additional regulation cuts we\\'ve cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country whether it\\'s four years eight years or in one case more i told you already our military is the best it\\'s ever been it\\'s got 2.5 trillion dollars worth of new beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything hopefully we never have to use it and our nuclear arsenal and hopefully hopefully we never have to even look at it our nuclear arsenal is at a level that it\\'s never ever been before and we have to have it there but we never want to use it so we have done things not only on the border the border is one element and to me it\\'s very important something that they always say about a president the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices so by the end of our not my our first term we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges and two supreme court justices and when it comes to second amendment when it comes to life when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for if you don\\'t have the supreme court and if you don\\'t have the courts on your side you can forget it and the next president i think will pick two three or even four justices of the supreme court they can be on the court for 40 to 50 years you pick them young they could be on there for 40 to 50 years this is going to be the most consequential presidency this is going to be the most important and i never thought i\\'d say it because of what happened four years ago this is going to be the most important election of your life so i just want to [Applause] thank you so i just want to say stay healthy stay sharp be careful be very careful go out and work like hell we need every single vote that we can get because it\\'s probably going to be close i always assume it\\'s going to be close they have the suppression the fakers back there they have these suppression polls where they interview many more democrats than they do republicans doug and i were talking about it and they take out of registered voters it\\'s not registered they say most likely to vote voters that\\'s what you\\'re most likely registered they\\'re dead they\\'re old they\\'re not going to go they\\'re not going to do anything be careful with your ballots but get out there november 3rd is the biggest date one of the biggest dates in your life in many cases frankly it\\'s the most important date of your life one other thing we\\'ve done a lot we\\'ve gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from obama like the paris accord that cost us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing we\\'ve gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea but you know what if we don\\'t win they can put it back and with the things that we did put in which are many many many things many things our military our vets everything with all of the things that we put in it\\'s like a tree it takes a little while to grab on you transplant it\\'s got to grab on if we have four more years there\\'s nothing that they can do our country is sailing our country is sailing so yuma thank you very much arizona thank you very much thank you for all your support we love you we will never ever let you down we will never let you down governor thank you martha go out and win go out and win vote mcsally thank you everybody eggs of minnesota to the hills of tennessee across the plains of texas from sea to shining sea from detroit down to houston and new york to l.a where there\\'s pride in every american heart and it\\'s time we stand and save thank you very much this is really great we love this state we won this state i don\\'t know if you know what\\'s going on outside but that\\'s right lou that\\'s as many people as you could possibly have all the way back how did you get in that\\'s my question i know you\\'re special friends of a group of people that have done a really good job and i want to thank you very much for being here but pennsylvania\\'s been very important to me i went to school in pennsylvania as you know college and i love it please sit down and by the time i finish i\\'m gonna have a nice sunburn right here this is good where\\'s my sunblock but i want to thank everybody in 75 days we\\'re going to win this state we\\'re going to win four more years they\\'ve had us under siege and we beat them and we beat them and we keep beating them but i\\'ll tell you you\\'ve never seen anything no president should have to go through what we\\'ve gone through no president should never happen and i watched president obama last night and i watched him talking about everything and i had to put it out i said yeah but he spied in our campaign and he got caught you know that\\'s about as bad a thing as you can imagine if that happened to another campaign on the other side it have had 25 people in jail for many years already many many years it\\'s a disgrace but in three years and what we\\'ve done in just a short period of time there\\'s been no administration that\\'s accomplished what we\\'ve accomplished and that\\'s despite pandemics and despite all of the opposition and all of the witch hunts the phony witch hunts no administration has done what we\\'ve done we\\'ve secured our borders brought back our manufacturing jobs we built our military wiped out the isis caliphate 100 killed our terrorist enemies achieved american energy independence and guess what we\\'re just getting started that\\'s a just a small part of it that\\'s a that\\'s a small part of it at stake in this election is the survi and you know this you know it and i mean it and i\\'ve never met it more at stake in this election is the survival of our nation it\\'s true because we\\'re dealing with crazy people on the other side they\\'ve gone totally stone cold crazy you know you look at hillary she was a lot smarter than joe but i\\'ll tell you there was a certain sense of sanity four years ago these people have gone insane and their radical left and you look at some of the things happening in these democrat-run cities which we could solve in two minutes all they have to do is call us right our great ex-congressman all they have to do is and thank you for being here but all they have to do is call us we\\'ll be in there in two minutes and we\\'ll take care of the problem joe biden is a puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the american way of life they don\\'t understand and probably when it happened they\\'d say what did we ever do joe biden has pledged to hike your taxes by four trillion dollars in the largest tax hike in history and they\\'re going to waste the money on the green new deals the green new deal you know what you get out of that nothing nothing except debt and death they want to eviscerate the second amendment they want to take away your guns they want to take away your guns well you remember that just that one point alone and they want to take away your guns so who\\'s going to vote for that i mean we want our second amendment i\\'ve held it strong and you think it was easy i\\'ve held it totally strong give free health care to illegal aliens you don\\'t get free health care expand deadly sanctuary cities force taxpayers to subsidize late term abortion shut down the energy fields of pennsylvania they want to shut them down no fossil fuel no fossil fuel texas isn\\'t too happy either go to texas i just left texas a little while ago two weeks i said they don\\'t want energy they don\\'t want guns and they don\\'t want religion guy stands up says not going to win texas but you have the same thing because you do be you\\'re a big fracking state you want to see your taxes go up stop fracking doesn\\'t hurt you at all fracking they want to throw up windmills that are going to ruin your houses i mean you know put up a big windmill you walk out your door you see this big monster churning but even that they don\\'t want to do i don\\'t think they want to do anything i think they want to close your businesses but just remember second amendment they\\'re going to take it away as sure as you\\'re sitting or standing they\\'re going to take it away from you the second amendment don\\'t let it happen close down charter schools eliminate school choice so important to abolish the suburbs they want to put low-income housing in the suburbs so the american dream and by the way we have a lot of minority groups that live in the suburbs african-american asian-american hispanic-american all did phenomenally last year with jobs best jobs we\\'ve ever had in the history of our country best economy we\\'ve ever had [Applause] but they\\'re a big part of the suburbs and they want to put low-income housing on the suburbs at a level that they\\'ve never done it before and it\\'s been a very look this has been going on for 20 years i terminated the regulation that did that they said well we can change i said no let\\'s terminate it people have to aspire to go there they want to aspire to live in the suburbs they want to abolish cash bail releasing 400 000 criminals onto our streets think of no no more cash bill look at what happened in new york cuomo ended cash bail cuomo that wasn\\'t even de blasio that it was cuomo the governor he ended it in new york and now the crime rate has gone through the roof the speaker at biden\\'s convention proudly declared we\\'re talking about abolishing the police we\\'re talking about abolishing ice and we\\'re talking about abolishing prisons and that\\'s the only thing they\\'re not abolishing are taxes because your taxes are going to go up at a level that you\\'ve never even heard of before if you want a vision of your life under biden presidency think of the smoldering ruins in minneapolis the violent anarchy of portland the blood-stained sidewalks of chicago and imagine the mayhem coming to your town and every single town in america you\\'re not going to have law and order do you notice and i shouldn\\'t say it because i\\'ll put it in his speech if he can read it which i doubt but they\\'ll put it in there tonight i shouldn\\'t say it because he\\'s going to speak later should have a good audience people are going to find out what the hell\\'s going on i see he hasn\\'t answered a question since they just said i just see it on the newscast since july 17th hasn\\'t taken a question from the fake news back there no think of it i take about 100 questions a day these people you know it\\'s one thing i\\'ve learned the uh the people heading these other countries whether it\\'s president xi of china putin of russia erdogan turkey any of them kim jong-un north korea remember we\\'re going to be in war with north korea remember it\\'s going to be a war right congressman there\\'s going to be a war if trump said we\\'re going to have a war no that it would have been a war if yet hillary clinton would have been a war if obama were allowed to stay any longer he thought there was going to be a well where\\'s the war i don\\'t see the war maybe things happen you don\\'t know but there\\'s been no war nobody killed you would have lost 25 30 million people they don\\'t say that they say 100 000 people no no seoul is 32 million people and it\\'s right next to the cannon fire and uh we have a good relationship with him i have a good relationship with him you know when i say that isn\\'t that terrible they say no it\\'s not terrible it\\'s great it\\'s great i have a relationship president obama said when i sat down that first meeting right in the white house he said it was the biggest problem we had in north korea and uh he would have had a big problem would have been a hell of a war tell you right now you\\'d probably be in that war right now so when i say that we got along and we\\'ve met everyone says oh that\\'s so terrible no it\\'s a good thing it\\'s a good thing not a bad thing it\\'s a good thing does it mean bad things don\\'t happen but it\\'s a good thing there\\'s only one thing standing between your family and the radical left-wing mob and that\\'s your vote this november this is a very important i feel like i\\'m a wall you know we built the wall on the southern border we\\'re gonna have 300 miles by two weeks from now even less 300 miles [Applause] and by the end of the year we\\'ll be up to almost 500 miles and then we\\'re going to go on a little bit further some areas that are loose a little bit loose we found out i\\'m going to put a little bit more about 536 miles going up at a record clip that\\'s doing phenomenally well if you want mobs and criminals you got to vote democrat look because that\\'s what it\\'s about it\\'s they don\\'t talk about law and order now i\\'m bringing it up now but if they haven\\'t i haven\\'t seen anybody get up i got just the other day endorsed by all the sheriffs of florida all the law enforcement i got endorsed i got endorsed by pennsylvania i got endorsed by texas by ohio i mean i think everybody i don\\'t know how can you endorse somebody else how can how could law enforcement endorse somebody else we gave all of our all of our ex-army equipment you know we have tremendous surplus equipment and it was sitting in warehouses all over the united states hundreds of millions of dollars i distributed it to the police whereas biden and obama they didn\\'t want to do that because they said no no no it makes the police look too strong i want the police to look strong you\\'ve got to look strong and a lot of it was protective equipment if you want jobs and you want a lot of police and you want a lack of crime you know if you take away new york and chicago and some of these terrible cities that you see about you know with a crime the crime is so bad i left new york four years ago and i could see because he\\'s a terrible mayor i could see there were things that were happening that were bad he\\'s no rudy giuliani i can tell you that but i could see things were happening but the last six months seven months it just exploded it\\'s incredible crime up 368 percent 368 it\\'s crazy it\\'s crazy but if you want law and order and i can say sometimes they\\'ll say sir say it gently people want to hear gently they want say it gently don\\'t say law and order say if you\\'d like law and order and safety no i can\\'t do that if you want law and order you gotta have law and order you can\\'t have what\\'s happening in portland did you see the kid get whacked the other day just whacked like he was a piece of garbage i mean who could take it we don\\'t want that and pretty soon we\\'re going to have to send in our people because you know we\\'re supposed to wait till requests i don\\'t know if they\\'re embarrassed or what but these democrat cities they\\'re out of control they have none look at seattle where she said no we want a summer of love i mean this woman is crazy and they would have never taken back seattle except they knew we were going in the next day that\\'s the only reason they even did it so tonight we have slo judo will speak at the democrat convention and i\\'m sure that he\\'ll just knock him dead and he\\'ll remind us that he was born in scranton but you know he left like 70 years ago right he left a long time ago he wanted one you know i view it differently he\\'d say he was born here but he left that he was like eight nine or ten so he left 68 years ago he left a long time ago so i view it differently he wasn\\'t born here he abandoned scranton okay his family had something to do with that you know his parents but he loves grant i mean he keeps talking about i was born in screen i lived in scandinavia for a few years and then he left for another state you know the state but the scranton stuff that\\'s why i figured i\\'d come here and explain to you one thing but i think you people know it better than i do he left he abandoned pennsylvania he abandoned swent he was here for a short period of time and he didn\\'t even know it and today it\\'s amazing it goes around in a circle he still doesn\\'t know it okay but he spent the last half century in washington selling out our country and ripping off our jobs and letting other countries steal our jobs mexico china all of them just stealing our jobs he\\'s been there for 47 years and now he\\'s going to come in and make a change i don\\'t think so his son walked out with 1.5 billion dollars to manage that\\'s millions of dollars a year and the sun didn\\'t even have a job before that and i asked the wall street people tell me is that possible smartest people top people on wall street they say can\\'t happen it can\\'t happen the smartest people the people that do get money from every country from everybody they say can\\'t happen he walked out of there in 10 minutes with 1.5 billion dollars he explained that one right and then if they want to look at him nobody looks at him nobody looks at ukraine he gets 83 000 a month and a three million dollar upfront payment because of his great expertise and energy but he had none and he even admitted no i don\\'t know anything about energy but he goes on to an energy company gets millions of dollars 83 it\\'s actually double that because it was him and some guy that knew less than he did and is that okay yeah is it okay when joe biden goes and says a billion dollars you\\'re not getting it unless you get rid of those prosecutors you talk about quid pro quo right that\\'s your quid broke row and they did quid pro quo right and they did they got rid of the prosecutors and then he\\'s called he says now you\\'re getting your money okay figure this how about if that\\'s a republican doing that what happens to that republican it\\'s over it\\'s a disgrace but it\\'s changing slowly too slowly as far as i\\'m concerned joe biden is no friend of pennsylvania he\\'s actually for the reasons we just said he\\'s your worst nightmare biden supported every single globalist attack on pennsylvania workers nafta china\\'s entry into the world trade organization which built china into a power tpp korea the horrible ridiculous paris climate accord which stripped our nation of its energy and the so-called clean power plan the only good thing about it was the name it was a horrible unfair deal horrible for you and horrible for pennsylvania they want to take your power away you know what your power is your power is the billions of dollars you make on going deep into the earth and taking out what you have to take out everything you want from fracking you you don\\'t realize how big a fracking state does anybody know how big fracking is you\\'re not you\\'re not going to be allowed to frack anymore it\\'s not going to be uh no oil no nothing no oil no gas no nothing just think of that what would happen is you well first of all many of you i guess six hundred thousand six hundred and seventy thousand lose their jobs no money no oil higher taxes your stock market would crash if they get in beyond fracking if they get in you\\'ll have your 401ks which you\\'re setting records by the way stock market just hit a new high and don\\'t forget we\\'ve been going through this horrible plague from china it just hit a new high so think of that it\\'s incredible but your 401ks how many people have 401ks here good that\\'s a lot that\\'s a lot how about if they went down to like 10 of what they are now because that can happen that can happen and it will happen if if we\\'re stupid and we don\\'t go out and vote and secure your ballot absentee ballots are good but the stuff where they take millions and millions of ballots and send them all over the place we\\'ll grab it and we\\'ll just put them in a big pile there everyone grab it it\\'s a disgrace even common sense tells you that look at new york look at what happened in new jersey look at what happened in virginia look at what happened i won\\'t go through the details you know the story they have no control whatsoever in new jersey 20 percent of the ballots were defective fraudulent 20 and that\\'s because they did a good job okay so uh this is just a way they\\'re trying to steal the election and everybody knows that because the only way they\\'re gonna win is by a rigged election i really believe that i saw the crowd outside for every sign we had for trump pence every single sign i never i mean you know but and that\\'s not that atypical in texas we had people on the highways on the roadways we\\'re driving to some oil well where we gave a speech but between it was 20 minute drive between the plane and that oil well there were tens of thousands of people and they had the signs trump and trump pence and flags american flags you know when the other side does show up which is rarely they never have an american flag i can always tell if there\\'s a group of people they never you\\'d never see an american flag the fake news would tell you that but you never see but they don\\'t put it down they\\'ll tell you that personally but they won\\'t write it but you never see an american flag it\\'s an amazing thing but if you look outside today is it a hundred to one two hundred to one and then you\\'ll read tomorrow that biden was well represented he wasn\\'t well there were hardly anybody there every once in a while see a bite not be waving to the people i see a bite and i\\'d say well i waved to her anyway who cares no but was it a hundred to one i mean it\\'s just massive and you\\'ll read tomorrow that he had a massive crowd also pennsylvania lost more than one in three manufacturing jobs after nafta and china\\'s entry into the wto and that was a vote and courtesy of sleepy joe biden looked american labor into the eyes it took their dues their union endorsements and their votes the unions i mean the unions have to be more reasonable they have to be more reasonable and we love the unions we love non-union we love i\\'ve had it all you know i built every building i built in new york was with unions and unions are fine you know a lot of republicans don\\'t want me to say that but i\\'ll tell you unions are fine tell them to keep their dues down please but they\\'re fine and you have unions here you have non-unions but what i talk about is the worker they treated our workers horribly we lost our jobs to foreign lands our workers got fired whether they were in the unions or not then he sold out and he passed the cadillac tax you know what that is on union healthcare plans attacked their energy jobs and sent their factories to china and now he\\'s back begging for their votes and you know people it\\'s like a custom democrats except with me i came in i got so many union votes i get far more i mean you look at you\\'ve seen it i\\'ve a couple of people either lost their job or came very close that were unbeatable because they led a charge for the democrats for crooked hillary last time they let a charge and the the people in the union didn\\'t want that they didn\\'t want hillary they wanted trump and we had union revolts we call them they revolted but these guys right here are you all union people i can tell are you union it\\'s good right it\\'s fine that\\'s fine look at that you get a hand certain parts of the country they wouldn\\'t be as happy but that\\'s okay right and it\\'s great but they were not happy and you know what was happening they were not happy when the bosses got endorsed by the democrats american labor will vote for trump pence in 2020 they\\'re all saying that and this area is going to be an incredible area this used to be all democrat until i came along until i came along this was democrat this was heavily union it was democrat it was everything but they like trump and i\\'m gonna never let you down and they will let you down they will let you down first of all the country will be let down because the country you will see a crash like you\\'ve never seen before and as good as those stock market numbers are there\\'s a headwind the head one is that if he won the market\\'s gonna crash the green new deal all of the different things socialized medicine that\\'s what they want it\\'s socialized medicine no doctor no plan obama lied about it 28 times remember he said you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan it wasn\\'t true 28 different times they have them for the last four years we\\'ve been reversing biden\\'s betrayals and delivering historic wins for the people of pennsylvania your state lost over 50 000 manufacturing jobs when biden was vice president in my first three years pennsylvania gained 14 000 jobs manufacturing and going up at a level that nobody\\'s ever seen before we\\'ll catch all of those jobs that were lost they said manufacturing jobs will never come back remember you need a magic wand where\\'s the magic wand well we have the magic one my first week in office i withdrew from the trans-pacific partnership it would have been totally destructive to your jobs it would have been a horror show i withdrew from the one-sided paris climate accord which would have cost us so many billions of dollars and all it would have done is made the competition even tougher all over the world i believe it was designed to hurt the united states and to get jobs away from us and companies i stood up to china\\'s rampant cheating plunder and theft i repealed that horrible tax so many taxes how many taxes did i repeal you know i\\'m getting a list of them now i\\'ll have it for you for the next meeting because i\\'ll be back to pennsylvania that i promise and i\\'m standing up to the special interests and the big farmer weeks ago i signed four historic directives to dramatically reduce the cost of prescription drugs think of it you know what i did i signed i signed as you know and as you\\'ve seen i guess but other countries have sometimes 10 percent of what we pay for the same exact pill same drug same prescription drug and i signed a deal that we get that\\'s not signed by the drug companies they hate it they\\'re taking advertising whenever you see bad ads on me from drug companies just remember one thing that means your prices are coming down that means your prices but it was it\\'s called favored nations favored nations we were the least favorite nation in the whole world we paid the highest price so i signed if germany as an example pays 10 cents for a pill and we pay three dollars for the exact same pill we pay 10 cents also now what means is they\\'re going to go up we\\'re going to come way down you could we could drop drug prices by 50 60 or 70 percent at a level that has made them very angry and rebates too i ended rebates rebates go to you nobody else would have done that they could have done that a long time ago biden could have done it he didn\\'t know what it meant but i will tell you most people do know what but they can\\'t do it because big pharma is the most powerful group and i guess they say number one is it number one mr cup but you didn\\'t take any money from big pharma right good i\\'ll bet you didn\\'t uh i\\'ll bet you didn\\'t my man i ended the nafta disaster and i signed usmca into law usmc is phenomenal and it\\'s going to keep your companies from moving to mexico and other places after years of building up other nations we\\'re finally building up our nation and we are finally doing something that i\\'ve been talking about for years we are finally putting america first and i\\'ve done that right from the beginning we\\'re honored to be joined today by some incredible warriors that were really fantastic to me and friends of mine but they really fight these pennsylvania people are fighters in case you haven\\'t noticed representative scott perry scott where scott thank you scott great job scott the warriors lloyd smucker lloyd thank you thank you lord john joyce john thank you great job great job and a friend of mine and a great great man he would have been here forever if he decided to but he decided maybe it was time to do something else but uh this was a fighter like no other fighter and those three other gentlemen will attest right our friend lou barletta lou and they\\'re shouting i\\'m saying this with the media they\\'re shouting lou they\\'re not booing you know they\\'ll say he stood up and he got booed horribly it was a horrible embarrassing no that\\'s what they do they\\'re fake thanks also to our congressional candidates jim bognett jim oh look at him i\\'ve heard good things jim is it easy out there on the stump oh good good and you\\'re gonna win jim you\\'re gonna win and lisa sheller lisa thank you very much great job i hear you two are doing really good if you have any problems call lou he\\'ll help you let me also thank my campaign state chairwoman bernie comfort where are you thank you very much bernie thank you bernie great job you\\'re doing how we doing in pennsylvania okay yeah i think so i think so we don\\'t they did a lot of manipulation also a friend of mine for a long time and a great friend of his father and his maybe his grandfather i don\\'t even i hate to say that because it makes me sound a little bit older than i feel i feel young state gop chairman lawrence tabis what a great family i miss dan tabis you know that dan tabis what a great man he was i don\\'t know if you know him but he started out with about two cents and he ended up being a rich man and he employed a lot of people and he was a real friend of mine he didn\\'t like many people that was long before i ran for politics he didn\\'t like many people but he liked trump right people would go he was a rough guy people would go up to him and say hi dan how you doing he became a very successful guy and he\\'d look out at me and say i don\\'t want to talk to anybody i just want to talk to trump i like that kind of a guy right but he was a fantastic man actually he\\'s a good man before the china virus invaded our shores we built the greatest economy in history nothing even close we added 7 million jobs nationwide including 209 000 new jobs in pennsylvania by the way in the last three months we ha we right bernie over nine million jobs an all-time record this is now during and hopefully closing moments of the pandemic you notice how they at any time there\\'s a good country they like to compare because we\\'ve done an incredible job you look at our mortality rates you look at all the things but they like to compare us to others so they they were talking about new zealand new zealand it\\'s over it\\'s ultra for new zealand everything\\'s gone they\\'re beautiful they had a massive breakout yesterday south korea it\\'s over it\\'s over big breakout yesterday you know it\\'s a tough it\\'s a tough deal we\\'ve done a great job we\\'re a big big country and you know maybe this is popular to say maybe it\\'s not i don\\'t care because based on the crowd outside it looks to me like we\\'re going to win this thing but i think by a by the way buy a lot but your governor has you in a shutdown like few what\\'s going on what\\'s going how did they all get out there and they were not socially distant i can tell you we\\'ll have to on the way back they\\'ll still be there because they\\'re incredible people but what is he doing he\\'s got you in a shutdown still shut down wolf he can\\'t do this he\\'s going to destroy your soul you know what happens is depression anxiety problems with family members drugs heart attacks obesity i mean what is he doing it\\'s more dangerous than the virus he\\'s got to open this state up you know when he\\'s going to open it up no i know what he\\'s doing because a lot of them are doing it doing it in the great state of north carolina right they\\'re doing it in north carolina but they\\'re doing it in a lot of different areas but they\\'ve got to open this state up and you have to do it right this this wonderful incredible right i would call it a commonwealth do you have a mind if they call it a state no call it commonwealth whatever the hell you want to open it up and what is he doing what is he doing it\\'s very so the commonwealth of pennsylvania we\\'re going to get it open and i know when he\\'s going to do it you know what it is november 4th november 4th he\\'s going to say well we\\'re going to open it up then your results are no better than other states by the way it\\'s not like oh gee this is great it\\'s uh michigan has it closed down and north carolina has a close down and this uh commonwealth has a close down it\\'s really uh it\\'s a very sad thing to see and the results are not good the results it\\'s not like oh this is wonderful the results in some of these places is worse than those that are open and you know you have other states up i mean if you look at the country it\\'s really we have states we\\'re thriving we\\'re thriving and there\\'s no shutdown it\\'s enough we shut it down because we had to we didn\\'t know anything about what was happening we shut it down we learned a lot protect our seniors etc etc you\\'ve all heard it but we learned a lot that we opened it up and now we have a big v remember they said the v will never happen we have a big beautiful v we enacted the largest financial relief package in american history and through the paycheck protection program we saved nearly 2 million pennsylvania jobs we\\'ve also delivered nearly that\\'s right 2 million jobs we delivered nearly 11 billion dollars in direct support to pennsylvania families and over the past three months we\\'ve gained over 9 million jobs it\\'s uh nobody can even believe the numbers and watch the numbers will get better and better because we\\'re opening up and frankly the democrats should do it they should do what\\'s right for the country they know they should open wolfe knows he should open he knows that and how about his uh how about his person with his with the with her mother right with her mother where the mother was protected but the other people weren\\'t you had a massive number of deaths in nursing homes but 95 year old mother as i read and i said well that person will be gone very quickly and that person is still there i would say that\\'s something if somebody ever wants to run for the governor of pennsylvania that would be something good to use so they took the mother out of harm\\'s way and then moved her back when everything was okay and nobody says anything about it and there\\'s no firing retail spending is now at an all-time high who would have believed that auto production has gained 28 percent biden would terminate this unprecedented recovery he wants to impose a permanent lockdown combined with a socialist takeover of the u.s economy did you hear him the other day lock it down he wants to lock it down so everything that we\\'ve gained over the last number of months he wants to lock it down no we\\'re doing good florida is going down substantially arizona done a great job in arizona texas going down california\\'s going down it opened these states up and everybody wants to practice good hygiene all of the different things do the masks i mean it\\'s not going to hurt do them do them if you feel it do them but these things these places have to be opened up but november 4th you\\'ll open don\\'t worry about it but that\\'s a long time from now if you think about it right that\\'s a long time from now in biden\\'s policy manifesto written with socialist bernie sanders biden pledges to quickly outlaw american oil he\\'s going to outlaw american oil coal american call he\\'s going to outlaw natural gas which is really an amazing form of energy it clean by mandating net zero carbon emissions from all homes and buildings within nine years and from all power plants by 2035 so he wants to basically get rid of all fossil fuels and you know i know everything about energy i know so much about energy our new forms of alternative energy just aren\\'t powerful enough to power these massive plants and all of the things that are creating all of these jobs and all of this wealth for your state and for the country this week in california there were rolling blackouts because the radical democrats have mandated impossible restrictions on energy production and i see again the forest fires are starting starting again in california i said you got to clean your floors you got to clean your forests they have many many years of leaves and broken trees and they\\'re like like so flammable you touch them it goes up i\\'ve been telling them this now for three years but they don\\'t want to listen the environment the environment but they have massive fires again in california maybe we\\'re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don\\'t listen to us we say you got to get rid of the leaves you got to get rid of the debris you got to get rid of the fallen trees you know when a tree falls after 13 to 14 months it becomes extremely dry you look at some of these fires they don\\'t really catch where the trees are growing because they\\'re wet the water\\'s pouring up the tree and they just don\\'t want to listen they mocked us when i said that you gotta clean your floors just an expression clean the floors and they have many many years decades of of leaves dry leaves and everything that\\'s why they have it there are other places forest cities their forests they were developed in forests and they don\\'t have any problem with more flammable trees than you have in california but they just don\\'t want to do it senior citizens were forced to sit in their homes with no air conditioning in the middle of the summer and biden wants to eliminate power plants all across america you had a problem over here but think of that if they do that get used to no air conditioning they probably don\\'t want that either under my administration we ended the war on american energy and i put the miners back to work we put them back to work the miners are back to work now i approve the keystone xl and the dakota access pipelines almost right at the beginning i just approved them right at the beginning and uh a lot of jobs and it\\'s by the way it\\'s cleaner it\\'s a much cleaner form of transportation america is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world think of that one to protect our great steel workers you have a couple of steady steel workers here by the way to protect our great steel workers i placed tariffs on nations that were dumping cheap foreign steel all over the place and we have created an incredible industry out of nothing it was ready to go out within months steel imports dropped by 26 and american steel production surged by 18 million tons almost immediately biden abandoned the steel industry and saved other industries that were worthless but he didn\\'t save the steel industry we saved the seal industry you wouldn\\'t have a steel industry right now when joe biden was vice president the border was an open pipeline for criminals gang members and cartels flooding our schools with drugs under my administration we ended the catch and release horrible catch and release you catch the criminal you take their name you say is this right we don\\'t have identification oh that\\'s okay it\\'s like voting they don\\'t want to have voter id why there\\'s only one reason the democrats don\\'t want voter id you have id for almost everything you have your picture everything nice but not on a vote most important thing you can do is to vote and voter id but they don\\'t want it there\\'s only one reason they don\\'t want voter id and you know what that is right that\\'s really better you guys all in favor by the way of voter id if they if they weren\\'t they wouldn\\'t be congressmen in good standing for uh for very long i\\'ll tell you that we stopped asylum fraud and we deported 20 000 gang members and 423 000 criminal aliens we got him the hell out of our country but if biden is elected all of the security will quickly vanish control of the border will be seated to violent cartels and the left-wing crazies who empower them and you know used to see these massive amounts of illegals coming up from honduras right from guatemala el salvador they\\'d come up and it\\'d be just thousands of them you don\\'t see that anymore mexico is putting sev they have right now they have for months 27 000 of their soldiers on our southern border got to do it you got to do it mexico has been really working with us very well i have to tell you the new president of mexico now he\\'s not so new he\\'s been there a little while but the president of mexico has done a great job as far as i\\'m concerned from the standpoint of our relationship and our relationship with mexico in his joint manifesto with bernie sanders biden has called for a complete suspension of deportations closing down detention facilities ending border prosecutions think of this restoring and expanding catch and release handing out free welfare to new arrivals work permits for illegal crossers and mass amnesty for all illegal aliens can you believe this no this is a bernie said this is bernie plus you know i thought bryden would be taken right this is to show you how good a negotiator is bernie took him left he\\'s supposed to start and they\\'re supposed to meet a little bit left of center maybe for them for us it\\'s right or center but bernie actually took him left along with aoc plus three right aoc plus it\\'s another beauty she\\'s the designer of the green new deal she knows nothing about the environment she probably never studied and asked her how many hours have you taken on the environment biden wants to open your borders in the middle of the pandemic thank goodness we have that 300 miles of wall because you would have had a problem like you never would have seen before i want strong borders and i want safe communities if we don\\'t have borders i was saying this from day one if we don\\'t have borders we don\\'t have a country i imposed a travel ban on jihadist regions to keep terrorists out of our country and it worked and it got approved and the press said he failed and they were right the lower court failed your appeals court failed and i wanted the supreme court so they still say it failed because i lost it the first two courts that\\'s how dishonest they are they say he lost because i lost in the first two courts but we won at the supreme court they forget to mention that fact joe biden has pledged to remove this ban opening the floodgates to terror and terror hot spots and increasing the number of refugees allowed into our country by 700 that\\'s the manifesto of aoc and bernie joe biden and kamala she\\'s another beauty also strongly support the deadly sanctuary cities that have been so bad for you and everybody else as district attorney in san francisco kamala put a drug-dealing illegal alien into a job and jobs program instead of into prison four months later the illegal alien robbed a 29 year old woman mowed her down with an suv fracturing her skull and ruining her life we believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding americans not for criminal aliens after eight long years joe biden and barack obama left america weak disrespected and endangered we are respected again we are a respected country again they said that one of the leaders called up top top leader of one of the countries he asked me to call president erdogan of turkey who i get along with very well he said sir please would you do me a favor call her to one i said why can\\'t you do it he says you\\'re the only one he respects you\\'re the only person he respects i tell you this story i like telling very personal stories but they did say that you\\'re the only one he\\'ll listen to i said is that because of the united states they said no it\\'s because of you so you know that\\'s not so bad i might as well i might as well tell you the stories because they won\\'t we\\'ve invested more than two trillion dollars to rebuild our military our military\\'s in the best shape it\\'s ever been and everything everything is made in the usa and we\\'ve revived the historic shipyard in a place called philadelphia with hundreds and hundreds of new jobs you know that and we\\'ve just launched space force i never talked about it the campaign trail lou right i never talked about i\\'m the only one probably that ever ran for office in this country that\\'s achieved more than i said i would i never talked about space force i never talked about it but i realized how important it was that we got it the sixth branch think of that six brands that\\'s a big deal american rockets are once again sending american astronauts into space we renewed nasa it was a field of weeds the field of weeds president obama closed it down we\\'re now sending rockets up and a lot of those rockets are paid by rich people they like sending up rockets for whatever reason they like it i say go ahead you can use pay us a little rent and you can use that properly we withdrew from the disastrous iran nuclear deal a horror show the isis caliphate was destroyed the founder and leader of isis the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead the world\\'s number one terrorist kasim sulaimani is dead joe biden voted for the war in iraq i kept us out of new wars everyone said oh trump is his personnel he\\'ll be in a war\\'s first week instead of that i got you out of wars we\\'re down to a minimum number in iraq afghanistan will be down very shortly to 4 000 troops and that\\'ll come back shortly too syria we took them all out other than were we kept the oil if that\\'s okay with you we kept the oil we have some back and keeping the oil we should have kept the oil in iraq too remember i used to say keep the oil don\\'t go in i\\'d say don\\'t go into iraq but i was a civilian nobody cared i was like you so nobody cares i want to get that mosquito out of you they\\'ll say it\\'s cruelty to animals i don\\'t know it\\'s true they they have they were saying the other night the shark they were saying no sharks we have to protect them i said wait a minute wait they actually want to remove all the seals in order to save the shark they say wait don\\'t you have it the other way around that\\'s true i\\'m not a big fan of sharks either i don\\'t know how many votes am i going to lose i have people calling me up sir we want to do we have a fund to save the shark it\\'s called safe the shark i say no thank you i have other things i can contribute to i recognize israel\\'s true capital opened the american embassy in jerusalem and recognized israel and its sovereignty over the golan heights nobody else they talked about it for years for years and years many many presidents talked about the capital of israel jerusalem and they never did it i did it in golan heights 52 years they\\'ve been meeting on golan heights i did it last week we reached a historic breakthrough in the middle east finalizing a groundbreaking agreement between israel and the united arab emirates people can\\'t even believe it even the new york times gave us a great editorial they can\\'t even believe it we pass veterans choice and veterans accountability for our great vets nobody\\'s done for the vets what i have nobody not even close we love the vets and federal workers who failed and mistreated our veterans now can be told you\\'re fired that\\'s accountability we couldn\\'t fire them we had sadists we had thieves we had some bad people they let go of 9 000 people in the va they were bad people they didn\\'t love our vets now they have to love our vets in a second term in office we will create 10 million jobs in the next year we will hire more police we will ban sanctuary cities we will appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in the rule of law not the rule of that horrible mob that you get to watch on television we will provide school choice in every home we\\'re gonna we\\'re gonna let you have school choice that\\'s a very important thing the democrats don\\'t want anything to do with school choice we will lower the price of prescription drugs as i said we will build and expand our energy infrastructure to a level that is even greater than what we have right now and when i said before we\\'re number one we\\'re number one by a lot nobody thought would ever be number one and we are energy independent which is very nice and as we\\'ve been doing we will end our reliance on china and other countries for drugs and other things we will make our critical drugs medicines and supplies here in the united states we will give tax credits to companies to bring jobs back to america and if they don\\'t do it we\\'ll put tariffs on those companies and they\\'ll have to pay us a lot of money so what are they going to do they\\'re going to bring the jobs back in every action every moment and every decision i\\'m fighting for you i\\'m fighting for pennsylvania a lot of people got rich and got powerful at your expense now these same liberal hypocrites want to open up orders and let violent mobs rule the streets while they live in waldorf compounds and communities they wanted to fund police while hiring private security they want to let rioters burn churches while jailing you for praying in your church they want to abolish school choice while sending their children to the best private schools in the land they want to cancel you totally cancel you take your job turn your family against you for speaking your mind while they indoctrinate your children with twisted twisted world views that nobody ever thought possible you notice they\\'re not knocking down statues and monuments anymore because when i saw what was happening i took an old law and i signed a nice new executive order and then i explained 10 years if you knocked down a statue federal statute or monument and they were all set to march and washington were going to knock down some nice statues and then they said you know what let\\'s not march the march ended very quickly there was no more marching they said you know 10 years that\\'s a long time it\\'s a long time to knock over a statue that many people love and many people don\\'t and there\\'s a way of getting it down you do it through a legal process it\\'ll go quickly if it\\'s right joe biden is the candidate of these privileged liberal hypocrites who hold you and your values in disdain but you can send them all a thundering message on election day by voting for trump pence do we love our vice president do we love our vice president i\\'ll tell you i watched kamala last night and i said i\\'ll take mike i\\'ll take mike by a lot he\\'s been a great vice president actually pennsylvania is the state that gave us the declaration of independence valley forge gettysburg and generations of american patriots just like you you\\'re patriots you love this country that\\'s why you\\'re here you\\'re sitting in this boiling crazy hot sun but you\\'re smarter than me because with you it\\'s on the back of your head with me i\\'m gonna go home and my wife is going to say what happened you look like a lobster look at the sun this is great i want to look like lou nice and dark right but with lou it\\'s a little easier i think this is the state where workers got their hands dirty mining the call and forging the steel that raised up the mightiest nation in the history of the world and we\\'re going to be stronger than ever before remember that we are already we are going to be stronger than ever before and that\\'s happening right now proud citizens like you helped build this country and and you know this look together we\\'re taking back our country but i was just thinking as i said stronger they want to come in and raise your taxes they want to come in and put regulations on all of your factories and all of your jobs and all of your personal things you know little things and they laugh at it when i say it the light bulb those new expensive light bulbs i said what happened to the old ones they\\'re better they said they were mandated out i said why nobody could explain why i said we\\'re letting them back the light bulbs are back dishwashers they have dishwashers they don\\'t give you any water they give you not enough water so they\\'re lousy so what do people do they press the button again and again no water i let them have lots of water just got back from whirlpool in ohio they\\'re thriving now because of what i did to competition from other countries i tariffed him and whirlpool now went from a company that was just about over to a company that\\'s thriving sink faucets shower faucets i won\\'t say the third element of the bathroom because they always just bring that up so i won\\'t say that but you know what i\\'m talking about they don\\'t allow water you go into a new hotel you turn on the water there\\'s no water i opened it up i said they could have as much water i mean does pennsylvania have a problem with water no yeah you have a problem with water you have too much of it right you have too much water you got to get rid of it so why are we having restrictors they have restrictors on so i took it off these are little things i tell you about them a lot of people appreciate it a lot of people don\\'t know about it but now you can go out buy a light bulb for a tiny fraction of the course that\\'s better won\\'t last as long but it\\'s better it\\'s better light makes me look much better that\\'s a very important it\\'s a very important thing but you can buy now faucets where water actually comes out and so instead of having it like on for many times longer and actually when i take a shower i can have water hit my hair instead of drop drop it\\'s hard enough my hair without that so now we can actually have water pouring out of our shower heads okay so a lot of good things we\\'ve done a lot of things that nobody talks about nobody writes about but it\\'s about quality of life and i think the people really appreciate it i really do not so easy to do not so easy to do i don\\'t think anybody else could have done it nobody else would have thought to do things like that but nobody else would have would have done it we\\'re returning power to you the american people from scranton to easton how\\'s ernie doing good huh how good is ernie right yeah is he great ernie holmes he was heavyweight heavyweight champ right the chair larry larry sorry about that i know another one named ernie holmes larry holmes is he still in the area of uh how good was larry right that was probably muhammad ali\\'s uh most dangerous fight it was i\\'ve never seen anything like it mohammed would never go down but larry holmes was a great champion and i know he loved easton he used to tell me that i want to invest my money in he said i don\\'t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing i hope he\\'s doing well but he was one hell of a fighter from scranton to easton to allentown we\\'re going to fight for every job every family every neighborhood and every vote together we\\'ll unite citizens of every race color religion and creed as one people one family one glorious nation under god that\\'s another word they don\\'t want you to say god you know that right did you see they were doing something last night that was extremely basic and always has had the word god and they decided to take the word god out but this is where they\\'re coming from they\\'re coming to get you this is where they\\'re coming from and me we with a wall between the american dream and total insanity and the destruction of the greatest country in the history of the world we\\'re all that stands we\\'re all that stands and a typical republican probably wouldn\\'t get there but i think i\\'m you know very republican in many ways but your typical republican would not be able to win like your area this has always been a democrat area and yet the votes for trump here are through the roof you know how successful we were four years ago incredible it\\'s a great area these are great people they\\'re great hard-working incredible people and we love them with your drive and devotion we will win a historic victory on november 3rd and we will make america greater than it\\'s ever been before i just want to thank the people of scranton the the lack of home okay the lack of home for joe biden remember the next thing we\\'re going to stop them from saying these things but you look at he\\'s going to make a speech tonight it\\'s going to be very interesting to see how he does and i hope he does well i\\'ll be honest i do i hope he does well i really hope he does well but i also want him to tell the truth he\\'s got to tell the truth about things and he\\'s going to do a lot better if he does but hopefully not well enough right now we are leading a war that\\'s incredible but right now we\\'re leading in so many polls that they refuse to put out we\\'re doing so good in this state in north carolina in florida in texas in ohio in michigan you know how many car plants are being built or expanded in michigan we\\'re doing fantastically in michigan we\\'re doing great in new hampshire these are real polls these aren\\'t suppression polls these aren\\'t polls where they do registered voters register no you want to do voters that are going to vote registered voters you want to do what\\'s called likely voters likely in other words people that are likely to vote not registered voters many of whom have died many of whom aren\\'t going to vote and then you want to do an even count you don\\'t want to do many more democrats they do a poll many right many many democrats few few republicans trump is down by six and then you look and you say well that poll is true we\\'re up by 10. so we\\'re going to see you\\'re going to see they did it last time they had me losing every swing set i think he had to be losing like nine states that i won but he\\'s going to lose right you were the first one that told me lou he\\'s going to lose seven swing states he\\'s going to lose them all he\\'s down by 14 washington post abc they had me down one week before the election 12 to 14 points the day of the election because we complained that it was a fake poll so they changed it the day of the election and they had us just about even remember that whole big deal we said you can\\'t say we\\'re done because that\\'s called suppression then you say hey i love trump but i can\\'t vote for him because i don\\'t have the time because he\\'s not going to win but if you would have gone out and voted we would have won the problem was last time for them 2016 everybody went out and voted there was no suppression there was incredible exhilaration except except on the other side that they would not you ever see those pictures of the craziness going on but the polls were fake just like their stories are fake just like the news is fake the polls are even worse and we\\'re now actually doing work as one of the most accurate polls was rasmussen and rasmussen came out today did you see it 51 for trump 51. [Applause] i think they were one of the three most accurate polls and the ones that are telling the truth sometimes i mean they have a poll that came out recently that was very favorable they refused to release it they didn\\'t want the people to see it what kind of stuff is this that\\'s why you\\'re going to do a great job right you\\'re going to make sure this stuff doesn\\'t happen but we\\'re going to make sure too so we\\'re going to win this and i think we\\'re going to win it really big when you see those people outside and i mean you can take this crowd or multiply at times it looks like a hundred right you can multiply it times 100 but when you see this crowd and when you see the kind of enthusiasm there\\'s nothing like it we\\'re leading by the way even they admit we\\'re leading by enthusiasm by numbers like they\\'ve never seen before record numbers meaning we have record enthusiasm and he has a record lack of enthusiasm and that is a big big factor so i just want to thank all of the people from this incredible place i mean it\\'s just a a great great great place i\\'ve been here for so long and so much and i love it i love the people we\\'re gonna have the biggest victory we\\'re gonna have a victory that will equal or surpass what we did in 2016. thank you all very much thank you very much [Music] cause you\\'re in a new town there\\'s [Music] and i\\'m sure you will find many ways to have a good time [Music] it\\'s fun to stay at the mca it\\'s fun to stay at the fire [Music] enjoy [Applause] friends delegates and distinguished guests please i stand before you tonight honored by your support proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for america over the next four years we begin this evening our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of hurricane laura we are working closely with state and local officials in texas louisiana arkansas mississippi sparing no effort to save lives while the hurricane was fierce one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago and this is due to the great work of fema law enforcement and the individual states i will be going this weekend and congratulations thank you for that great job out there we really appreciate it we are one national family and we will always protect love and care for each other here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible and filled my life with so much joy for her incredible service to our nation and its children i want to thank our magnificent first lady i also want to thank my amazing daughter ivanka for that introduction and to all of my children ivanka please stand up thank you and to all of my children and grandchildren i love you more than words can express i know my brother robert is looking down on us right now from heaven he was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are all doing thank you we love you robert let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction our vice president mike pence and mike is joined by his beloved wife a teacher and military mom karen pence thank you karen my fellow americans tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism i profoundly accept this nomination for president of the united states the republican party the party of abraham lincoln goes forward united determined and ready to welcome millions of democrats independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of america and the righteous heart of the american people in a new term as president we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment soaring incomes and record prosperity we will defend america against all threats and protect america against all dangers we will lead america into new frontiers of ambition and discovery and we will reach for new heights of national achievement we will rekindle new faith in our values new pride in our history and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country because we understand that america is not a land cloaked in darkness america is the torch that enlightens the entire world gathered here at our beautiful and majestic white house known all over the world as the people\\'s house we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great american story this has been the home of larger than life figures like teddy roosevelt and andrew jackson who rallied americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future within these walls lived tenacious generals like president grant and eisenhower who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom from these grounds thomas jefferson sent lewis and clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent in the depths of a bloody civil war president abraham lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed washington monument and ask god in his providence to save our nation two weeks after pearl harbor franklin delano roosevelt welcomed winston churchill just inside they set our people on a course to victory in the second world war in recent months our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy like those brave americans before us we are meeting this challenge we are delivering life-saving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year or maybe even sooner we will defeat the virus end the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before what united generations past was an unshakable confidence in america\\'s destiny and an unbreakable faith in the american people they knew that our country is blessed by god and has a special purpose in this world it is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union our westward expansion the abolition of slavery the passage of civil rights the space program and the overthrow of fascism tyranny and communism this towering american spirit has prevailed over every challenge and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor and yet despite all of our greatness as a nation everything we have achieved is now in danger this is the most important election in the history of our country thank you at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies or two agendas this election will decide whether we save the american dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny it will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high-paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas as has foolishly been done for many decades your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding americans or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists and agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens and this election will decide whether we will defend the american way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it that won\\'t happen at the democrat national convention joe biden and his party repeatedly assailed america as a land of racial economic and social injustice so tonight i ask you a simple question how can the democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country in the left\\'s backward view they do not see america as the most free just and exceptional nation on earth instead they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them this is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history but in this country we don\\'t look to career politicians for salvation in america we don\\'t turn to government to restore our souls we put our faith in almighty god joe biden is not a savior of america\\'s soul he is the destroyer of america\\'s jobs and have given the chance he will be the destroyer of american greatness for 47 years joe biden took the donations of blue-collar workers gave them hugs and even kisses [Applause] and told them he felt their pain and then he flew back to washington and voted to ship our jobs to china and many other distant lands joe biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of american workers offshoring their jobs opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars wars that never ended four years ago i ran for president because i could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer i could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade borders foreign policy and national defense our nato partners as an example were very far behind in their defense payments but at my strong urging they agreed to pay 130 billion dollars more a year the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments and this 130 billion dollars will ultimately go to 400 billion dollars a year and secretary general stoltenberg who heads nato was amazed after watching for so many years and said that president trump did what no one else was able to do thank you from the moment i left my former life behind and it was a good life i have done nothing but fight for you i did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive breaking the cardinal rule of washington politics i kept my promise together we have ended the rule of the failed political class and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary you\\'ve seen that they are angry at me because instead of putting them first i very simply said america first thank you days after taking office we shocked the washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration\\'s job-killing trans-pacific partnership i then immediately approved the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines ended the unfair and very costly paris climate accord and secured for the first time american energy independence we passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before within three short years we built the strongest economy in the history of the world washington insiders asked me not to stand up to china they pleaded with me to let china continue stealing our jobs ripping us off and robbing our country blind but i kept my word to the american people we took the toughest boldest strongest and hardest hitting action against china in american history by far they said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace nafta but again they were wrong earlier this year i ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new u.s mexico canada agreement into law and right now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in america not firing their employees and not deserting us for other countries in perhaps no area did the washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-american immigration but i refuse to back down and today america\\'s borders are more secure than ever before thank you we ended catch and release stopped asylum fraud took down human traffickers who prey on women and children and we have deported twenty thousand gang members and five hundred thousand criminal aliens we have already built 300 miles of border wall and we are adding 10 new miles every single week the war will soon be complete and it is working beyond our wildest expectations we are joined this evening by members of the border patrol union representing our country\\'s courageous border agents thank you very much for being here thank you brave brave people you see this country loves our law enforcement they do thank you they really do love and respect i learned that the tennessee valley authority laid off hundreds of american workers and forced them to train their lower paid foreign replacement i promptly removed the chairman of the board and now those talented american workers have been rehired and are back providing power to georgia alabama tennessee kentucky mississippi north carolina and virginia they have their old jobs back and some are here with us this evening please stand you went through a lot please stand thank you thank you very much you\\'ve been through a lot thank you very much last month i took on big pharma you think that\\'s easy it\\'s not and signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs and give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures we passed the decades long awaited right to try right to try we also passed va accountability and va choice our great veterans for taking care of our veterans 91 percent approval rating this month the va given by our veterans first time anything like that\\'s ever happened by the end of my first term we will have approved more than 300 federal judges including two great new supreme court justices and to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform prison reform opportunity zones and long-term funding of historically black colleges and universities and before the china virus came in produced the best unemployment numbers for african americans hispanic americans and asian americans ever recorded and i say very modestly that i have done more for the african-american community than any president since abraham lincoln our first republican president and i have done more in three years for the black community than joe biden has done in 47 years and when i\\'m reelected the best is yet to come oh oh thank you very much [Applause] when i took office the middle east was in total chaos isis was rampaging iran was on the rise and the war in afghanistan had no end in sight i withdrew from the terrible one-sided iran nuclear deal unlike many presidents before me i kept my promise recognized israel\\'s true capital and moved our embassy to jerusalem but not only did we talk about it as a future site we got it built rather than spending one billion dollars on a new building as planned we took an already owned existing building in a better location real estate deal right and opened it at a cost of less than five hundred thousand dollars many things like that that government is doing right now we also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and this month we achieved the first middle east peace deal in 25 years thank you to uae thank you to israel in addition we obliterated 100 of the isis caliphate and killed its founder and leader abu bakar [Applause] al-baghdadi then in a separate operation we eliminated the world\\'s number one terrorist by far kasim solomini unlike previous administrations i have kept america out of new wars and our troops are coming home we have spent nearly 2.5 trillion dollars on completely rebuilding our military which was very badly depleted when i took office as you know this includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors we also launched the space force the first new branch of the united states military since the air force was created almost 75 years ago we have spent the last four years reversing the damage joe biden inflicted over the last 47 years biden\\'s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime he has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history biden voted for the nafta disaster the single worst trade deal ever enacted he supported china\\'s entry into the world trade organization one of the greatest economic disasters of all time after those biden calamities the united states lost one in four manufacturing jobs we laid off workers in michigan ohio new hampshire pennsylvania and many other states they didn\\'t want to hear biden\\'s hollow words of empathy they wanted their jobs back as vice president he supported the trans-pacific partnership which would have been a death sentence for the u.s auto industry he backed the horrendous south korea trade deal which took many jobs from our country and which i\\'ve reversed and made a great deal for our country he repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants he voted for the iraq war he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden he opposed killing solomani he oversaw the rise of isis and cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and the world some positive development that\\'s why china supports joe biden and desperately wants him to win i can tell you that upon very good information china would own our country if joe biden got elected unlike biden i will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world they caused in recent months our nation and the world has been hit by the once in a century pandemic that china allowed to spread around the globe they could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out we are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude many americans including me have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease as one nation we mourn we grieve and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken so unnecessary in their honor we will unite in their memory we will overcome and when the china virus hit we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii invoking the defense production act we produce the world\\'s largest supply of ventilators not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator which is a miracle good job heading the task force by our great vice president thank you very much mark please please stand back we shipped hundreds of millions of masked gloves and gowns to our front line healthcare workers to protect our nation\\'s seniors we rush supplies testing kits and personal to nursing homes we gave everything you can possibly give and we\\'re still giving it because we\\'re taking care of our senior citizens the army corps of engineers built field hospitals and the navy deployed our great hospital ships we developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world america has tested more than every country in europe put together and more than every nation in the western hemisphere combined think of that we have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation which is india we developed a wide array of effective treatments including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma you saw that on sunday night when we announced it that will save thousands and thousands of lives thanks to advances we have pioneered the fatality rate and you look at it and you look at the numbers it has been reduced by 80 percent since april 80 the united states has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world the european union\\'s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours but you don\\'t hear that they don\\'t write about that they don\\'t want to write about that they don\\'t want you to know those things all together the nations of europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the united states think of that we enacted the largest package of financial relief in american history thanks to our paycheck protection program we have saved or supported more than 50 million american jobs that\\'s one of the reasons that we\\'re advancing so rapidly with our economy great job as a result we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation and we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody over the past three months we have gained over nine million jobs and that\\'s a record in the history of our country unfortunately from the beginning our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize when i took bold action to issue a travel ban on china very early indeed joe biden called it hysterical and xenophobic and then i introduced a ban on europe very early again if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died instead of following the science joe biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country his shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation\\'s children families and citizens of all backgrounds the cost of the biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses depression alcohol addiction suicides heart attacks economic devastation job loss and much more joe biden\\'s plan is not a solution to the virus but rather it\\'s a surrender to the virus my administration has a very different approach to save as many lives as possible we are focusing on the science the facts and the data we are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk especially the elderly while allowing lower risk americans to safely return to work and to school and we want to see so many of those great states be open by democrats we want them to be open they have to be open they have to get back to work they have to get back to work and they have to get back to school most importantly we are marshaling america\\'s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time under operation warp speed we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now years ahead of what has been achieved before nobody thought it could ever be done this fast normally it would be years that we did it in a matter of a few months we\\'re producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available we will have a safe and effective vaccine this year and together we will crush the virus at the democrat convention you barely heard a word about their agenda but that\\'s not because they don\\'t have one it\\'s because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee joe biden may claim he is an ally of the light but when it comes to his agenda biden wants to keep us completely in the dark he doesn\\'t have a clue he has pledged a four trillion dollar tax hike on almost all american families which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets that we have right now will also collapse that means your 401ks that means all of the stocks that you have on the other hand just as i did in my first term i will cut taxes even further for hard-working moms and dads i will not raise taxes i will cut them and very substantially and we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of china back to america and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves america to produce jobs overseas we will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country as i\\'ve already been doing for quite some time if you\\'ve noticed joe biden\\'s agenda is made in china my agenda is made in the usa biden is promised to abolish the production of american oil coal shale and natural gas laying waste to the economies of pennsylvania ohio texas north dakota oklahoma colorado and new mexico destroying those states absolutely destroying those states and others millions of jobs will be lost and energy prices will soar these same policies led to crippling power outages in california just last week everybody saw that tremendous power outage nobody\\'s seen anything like it but we saw that last week in california how can joe biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can\\'t even keep the lights on joe biden\\'s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform you can\\'t get away from this co-authored with far left senator crazy bernie sanders the biden bernie manifesto calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens implementing nationwide catch and release and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers everybody gets a lawyer come on over to our country everybody has a lawyer we have a lawyer for you that\\'s what we need is more lawyers joe biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to your giveaway he was going to give it away your healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants which is going to bring massive numbers of immigrants into our country massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all of the goodies that they want to give education health care everything he also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens he promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent this is in the manifesto the biden plan would eliminate america\\'s borders in the middle of a global pandemic and he\\'s even talking about taking the wall down how about that biden also vowed to oppose school choice and close all charter schools ripping away the ladder of opportunity for black and hispanic children in a second term i will expand charter schools and provide school choice to every family in america and we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve great people great great people joe biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up until the moment of birth democrat leaders talk about moral decency but they have no problem with stopping a baby\\'s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life and then they lecture us about morality and saving america\\'s soul tonight we proudly declare that all children born and unborn have a god-given right to life during the democrat convention the words under god were removed from the pledge of allegiance not once but twice we will never do that but the fact is this is where they\\'re coming from like it or not this is where they\\'re coming from if the left gains power they will demolish the suburbs confiscate your guns and appoint justices who will wipe away your second amendment and other constitutional freedoms biden is a trojan horse for socialism if joe biden doesn\\'t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed marxists like bernie sanders and his fellow radicals and there are many there are many many we see him all the time it\\'s incredible actually then how is he ever going to stand up for you he\\'s not the most dangerous aspect of the biden platform is the attack on public safety the biden bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail immediately releasing 400 000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods when asked if he supports cutting police funding joe biden replied yes absolutely when congresswoman ilhan omar called the minneapolis police department a cancer that is rotten to the root biden wouldn\\'t disavow her support and reject her endorsement he proudly displayed it shortly later on his website displayed it in big letters make no mistake if you give power to joe biden the radical left will defund police departments all across america they will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide they will make every city look like democrat run portland oregon no one will be safe in biden\\'s america my administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement every day police officers risk their lives to keep us safe and every year many sacrificed their lives in the line of duty one of these incredible americans was detective miostas familia she was part of a team of american heroes called the nypd or new york\\'s finest was very very proud to get their endorsement just the other day great people great great people they were allowed to do their job you\\'d have no crime in new york rudy giuliani knows that better than anybody thank you rudy three years ago in the fourth of july weekend detective familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge detective familia was a single mom she recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids two years ago i stood in front of the u.s capitol alongside those beautiful children and held their grandmother\\'s hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored detective familia\\'s extraordinary life it was extraordinary detective familia\\'s three children are with us this evening genesis peter delilah we are so grateful to have you here tonight thank you very much for coming thank you very much thank you very much i promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever we must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country and that\\'s the overwhelming majority our noble courageous and honorable we have to give law enforcement our police back their power they are afraid to act they are afraid to lose their pension they are afraid to lose their jobs and by being afraid they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you and those who suffer most are the great people who they protect and who they want to protect at an even higher level when there is police misconduct the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable and it will but when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today we must never allow mob rule we can never allow mob rule in the strongest possible terms the republican party condemns the rioting looting arson and violence we have seen in democrat-run cities all like kenosha minneapolis portland chicago and new york and many others democrat run there is violence and danger in the streets of many democrat-run cities throughout america this problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to just call we\\'re ready to go in we\\'ll take care of your problem in a matter of hours just call we have to wait for the call it\\'s too bad we have to but we have to wait for the call we must always have law and order all federal crimes are being investigated prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law when the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside i signed an order immediately 10 years in prison and it was a miracle it all stopped no more statues they said that\\'s just too long as they looked at a statue i think we\\'ll rip it down then they said 10 years in prison i think that\\'s too long let\\'s go home during their convention joe biden and his supporters remain completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in democrat-run cities they never even mentioned it during their entire convention never once mentioned now they\\'re starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rocking water it\\'s too late joe in the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in minneapolis chicago and other cities joe biden\\'s campaign did not condemn it they donated to it at least 13 members of joe biden\\'s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals arsonists anarchists looters and rioters from jail here tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain david dorn a 38-year veteran of the saint louis police department a great man and a highly respected man by all in june captain doorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect the store from rioters and looters or as the democrats would call them peaceful protesters they call them peaceful protesters we\\'re honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife ann and beloved family members brian and kalyn to each of you we will never forget the heroic legacy of captain david dorn thank you very much for being here thank you thank you very much great man great man as long as i am president we will defend the absolute right of every american citizen to live in security dignity and peace if the democrat party wants to stand with anarchists agitators rioters looters and flag burners that is up to them but i as your president will not be a part of it the republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep america safe and salute the american flag last year over 1 000 african americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four democrat run cities the top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by democrats and have been for many decades thousands more african-americans are victims and victims of violent crime in these communities joe biden and the left ignore these american victims i never will if the radical left takes power they will apply their disastrous policies to every city town and suburb in america just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the u.s government just think of that liberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of american institutions but who exactly is attacking them who is hiring the radical professors judges and prosecutors who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent in every case the attacks on american institutions are being waged by radical left always remember they are coming after me because i am fighting for you that\\'s what\\'s happening and it\\'s been going on from before i even got elected and remember this they spied on my campaign and they got caught let\\'s see now what happens we must reclaim our independence from the left\\'s repressive mandates americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases and the ever more restrictive political decrees many things have a different name now and the rules are constantly changing the goal of cancel culture is to make decent americans live in fear of being fired expelled shamed humiliated and driven from society as we know it the far left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true very sad but on november 3rd you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget thank you thank you very much [Applause] joe biden is weak he takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage these same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land they want to open our borders while living in waldorf compounds and communities in the best neighborhoods in the world they wanted to fund the police while they have armed guards for themselves this november we must turn the page forever on this failed political class the fact is i\\'m here what\\'s the name of that building but i\\'ll say it differently the fact is we\\'re here and they\\'re not to me one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world and it\\'s not a building it\\'s a home as far as i\\'m concerned not even a house it\\'s a home it\\'s a wonderful place with an incredible history but it\\'s all because of you together we will write the next chapter of the great american story over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world we will expand opportunity zones thank you tim scott bring home our medical supply chains and we will end our resilience for bad things we will go right after china we will not rely on them one bit we are taking our business out of china we are bringing it home we want our business to come home we will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before we will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months and it will be higher than that we will hire more police increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities we will ban deadly sanctuary cities and ensure that federal health care is protected for american citizens not for illegal aliens we will have strong borders and i\\'ve said for years without borders we don\\'t have a country don\\'t have a country strike down terrorists who threaten our people and keep america out of endless and costly foreign wars we will appoint prosecutors judges justices who believe in enforcing the law not enforcing their own political agenda which is illegal we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race religion color and creed we will uphold your religious liberty and defend your second amendment right to keep and bear arms and if we don\\'t win your second amendment doesn\\'t have a chance i can tell you that i have totally protected it we will protect medicare and social security we will always and very strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions and that is a pledge from the entire republican party thank you kevin we will end surprise medical billing require price transparency and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums they\\'re coming way down we will greatly expand energy development continuing to remain the number one in the world and keep america energy independent and for those of you that still drive a car look how low your gasoline bill is you haven\\'t seen that in a long time we will win the race to 5g and build the world\\'s best cyber and missile defense already under construction we will fully restore patriotic education to our schools and always protect we will always always protect free speech on college campuses and we put a very big penalty in they do anything having to do with your free speech colleges have to pay a tremendous tremendous financial penalty and again it\\'s amazing how open they\\'ve been lately we will launch a new age of american ambition in space america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on mars this is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together so tonight i say to all americans this is the most important election in the history of our country there has never been such a difference between two parties or two individuals in ideology philosophy or vision than there is right now our opponents believe that america is a depraved nation we want our sons and daughters to know the truth america is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world our country wasn\\'t built by cancer speech codes and soul-crushing conformity we are not a nation of timid spirits we are a nation of fierce proud and independent american patriots we\\'re a nation of pilgrims pioneers adventurers explorers and trailblazers who refuse to be tied down held back or in any way reigned in americans have steel in their spines grit in their souls and fire in their hearts there is no one like us on earth i want every child in america to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history no matter where your family comes from no matter your background in america anyone can rise with hard work devotion and drive you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition our american ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent they braved the freezing winters crossed the raging rivers scaled the rocky peaks trekked the dangerous forests and worked from dawn till dusk these pioneers didn\\'t have money they didn\\'t have fame but they had each other they love their families they love their country and they loved their god when opportunity beckoned they picked up their bibles packed up their belongings climbed into their covered wagons and set out west for the next adventure ranchers and miners cowboys and sheriffs farmers and settlers they pressed on past the mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier legends were born why erp annie oakley davey crockett and buffalo bill americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range soon they had churches and communities then towns and with time great centers of industry and commerce that is who they were americans build their future we don\\'t tear down our past we are the nation that won a revolution toppled tyranny and fascism and delivered millions into freedom we laid down the railroads built the great ships raised up the skyscrapers revolutionized industry and sparked a new age of scientific discovery we set the trends in art and music radio and film sport and literature and we did it all with style and confidence and flair because that is who we are whenever our way of life was threatened our heroes answered the call from yorktown to gettysburg from normandy to iwo jima american patriots raced into canon blasts bullets and bayonets to rescue american liberty they had no fear but america didn\\'t stop there we looked into the sky and kept pressing onward we built a 6 million pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space we did it so the two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous american flag planted on the face of the moon for america nothing is impossible over the next four years we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy we will reach stunning new heights and we will show that the world for america there is a dream and it is not beyond your reach together we

closely with state and local officials in texas louisiana arkansas mississippi sparing no effort to save lives while the hurricane was fierce one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago and this is due to the great work of fema law enforcement and the individual states i will be going this weekend and congratulations thank you for that great job out there we really appreciate it we are one national family and we will always protect love and care for each other here tonight are the people who have

brother robert is looking down on us right now from heaven he was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are all doing thank you we love you robert let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction our vice president mike pence and mike is joined by his beloved wife a teacher and military mom karen pence thank you my fellow americans tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism i profoundly accept this nomination for president of the united states the republican party the party of abraham lincoln goes forward united determined and ready to welcome millions of democrats independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of america and the righteous heart of the american people in a new term as president we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment soaring incomes and record prosperity we will defend america against all threats and protect america against all dangers we will lead america into new frontiers of ambition and discovery and we will reach for new heights of national achievement we will rekindle new faith in our values new pride in our history and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country because we understand that america is not a land cloaked in darkness america is the torch that enlightens the entire world gathered here at our beautiful and majestic white house known all over the world as the people\\'s house we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great american story this has been the home of larger than life figures like teddy roosevelt and andrew jackson who rallied americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future within these walls lived tenacious generals like president grant and eisenhower who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom from these grounds thomas jefferson sent lewis and clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent in the depths of a bloody civil war president abraham lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed washington monument and asked god in his providence to save our nation two weeks after pearl harbor franklin delano roosevelt welcomed winston churchill and just inside they set our people on a course to victory in the second world war in recent months our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy like those brave americans before us we are meeting this challenge we are delivering life-saving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year or maybe even sooner we will defeat the virus end the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before what united generations passed was an unshakable confidence in america\\'s destiny and an unbreakable faith in the american people they knew that our country is blessed by god and has a special purpose in this world it is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union our westward expansion the abolition of slavery the passage of civil rights the space program and the overthrow of fascism tyranny and communism this towering american spirit has prevailed over every challenge and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor and yet despite all of our greatness as a nation everything we have achieved is now in danger this is the most important election in the history of our country at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies or two agendas this election will decide whether we save the american dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny it will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high-paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas as has foolishly been done for many decades your vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding americans or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists and agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens this election will decide whether we will defend the american way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it that won\\'t happen at the democrat national convention joe biden and his party repeatedly assailed america as a land of racial economic and social injustice so tonight i ask you a simple question how can the democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country in the left\\'s backward view they do not see america as the most free just and exceptional nation on earth instead they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them this is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history but in this country we don\\'t look to career politicians for salvation in america we don\\'t turn to government to restore our souls we put our faith in almighty god joe biden is not a savior of america\\'s soul he is the destroyer of america\\'s jobs and if given the chance he will be the destroyer of american greatness for 47 years joe biden took the donations of blue-collar workers gave them hugs and even kisses and told them he felt their pain and then he flew back to washington and voted to ship our jobs to china and many other distant lands joe biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of american workers offshoring their jobs opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars wars that never ended four years ago i ran for president because i could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer i could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade borders foreign policy and national defense our nato partners as an example were very far behind in their defense payments but at my strong urging they agreed to pay 130 billion dollars more a year the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments and this 130 billion dollars will ultimately go to 400 billion dollars a year and secretary general stoltenberg who heads nato was amazed after watching for so many years and said that president trump did what no one else was able to do thank you from the moment i left my former life behind and it was a good life i have done nothing but fight for you i did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive breaking the cardinal rule of washington politics i kept my promise together we have ended the rule of the failed political class and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary you\\'ve seen that they are angry at me because instead of putting them first i very simply said america first thank you days after taking office we shocked the washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration\\'s job-killing trans-pacific partnership i then immediately approved the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines ended the unfair and very costly paris climate accord and secured for the first time american energy independence we passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before within three short years we built the strongest economy in the history of the world washington insiders asked me not to stand up to china they pleaded with me to let china continue stealing our jobs ripping us off and robbing our country blind but i kept my word to the american people we took the toughest boldest strongest and hardest hitting action against china in american history by far they said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace nafta but again they were wrong earlier this year i ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new u.s mexico canada agreement into law and right now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in america not firing their employees and not deserting us for other countries in perhaps no area did the washington special interest try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-american immigration but i refuse to back down and today america\\'s borders are more secure than ever before we ended catch and release stopped asylum fraud took down human traffickers who prey on women and children and we have deported twenty thousand gang members and five hundred thousand criminal aliens we have already built 300 miles of border wall and we are adding 10 new miles every single week the war will soon be complete and it is working beyond our wildest expectations we are joined this evening by members of the border patrol union representing our country\\'s courageous border agents thank you very much for being here thank you brave brave people [Applause] you see this country loves our law enforcement they do thank you they really do love and respect when i learned that the tennessee valley authority laid off hundreds of american workers and forced them to train their lower paid foreign replacement i promptly removed the chairman of the board and now those talented american workers have been rehired and are back providing power to georgia alabama tennessee kentucky mississippi north carolina and virginia they have their old jobs back and some are here with us this evening please stand you went through a lot please stand thank you thank you very much we\\'ve been through a lot thank you very much last month i took on big pharma you think that\\'s easy and signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs and give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures we passed the decades long awaited right to try right to try we also passed va accountability and va choice our great veterans were taking care of our veterans 91 approval rating this month the va given by our veterans first time anything like that\\'s ever happened by the end of my first term we will have approved more than 300 federal judges including two great new supreme court justices and to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform prison reform opportunity zones and long-term funding of historically black colleges and universities and before the china virus came in produced the best unemployment numbers for african americans hispanic americans and asian americans ever recorded and i say very modestly that i have done more for the african-american community than any president since abraham lincoln our first republican president and i have done more in three years for the black community than joe biden has done in 47 years and when i\\'m reelected the best is yet to come thank you very much [Applause] when i took office the middle east was in total chaos isis was rampaging iran was on the rise and the war in afghanistan had no end in sight i withdrew from the terrible one-sided iran nuclear deal unlike many presidents before me i kept my promise recognized israel\\'s true capital and moved our embassy to jerusalem but not only did we talk about it as a future site we got it built rather than spending one billion dollars on a new building as planned we took an already owned existing building in a better location real estate deal right and opened it at a cost of less than five hundred thousand dollars many things like that that government is doing right now we also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and this month we achieved the first middle east peace deal in 25 years thank you to uae thank you to israel in addition we obliterated 100 of the isis caliphate and killed its founder and leader abu bakar al-baghdadi then in a separate operation we eliminated the world\\'s number one terrorist by far kasim solomini unlike previous administrations i have kept america out of new wars and our troops are coming home we have spent nearly 2.5 trillion dollars on completely rebuilding our military which was very badly depleted when i took office as you know this includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors we also launched the space force the first new branch of the united states military since the air force was created almost 75 years ago we have spent the last four years reversing the damage joe biden inflicted over the last 47 years biden\\'s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime he has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history biden voted for the nafta disaster the single worst trade deal ever enacted he supported china\\'s entry into the world trade organization one of the greatest economic disasters of all time after those biden calamities the united states lost one in four manufacturing jobs we laid off workers in michigan ohio new hampshire pennsylvania and many other states they didn\\'t want to hear biden\\'s hollow words of empathy they wanted their jobs back as vice president he supported the trans-pacific partnership which would have been a death sentence for the u.s auto industry he backed the horrendous south korea trade deal which took many jobs from our country and which i\\'ve reversed and made a great deal for our country he repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants he voted for the iraq war he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden he opposed killing solomani he oversaw the rise of isis and cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and the world some positive development that\\'s why china supports joe biden and desperately wants him to win i can tell you that upon very good information china would own our country if joe biden got elected unlike biden i will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world they caused in recent months our nation and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that china allowed to spread around the globe they could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out we are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude many americans including me have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease as one nation we mourn we grieve and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken so unnecessary in their honor we will unite in their memory we will overcome and when the china virus hit we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii invoking the defense production act we produce the world\\'s largest supply of ventilators not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator which is a miracle good job heading the task force by our great vice president thank you very much mike please please stand up we shipped hundreds of millions of masked gloves and gowns to our front-line healthcare workers to protect our nation\\'s seniors we rush supplies testing kits and personal to nursing homes we gave everything you can possibly give and we\\'re still giving it because we\\'re taking care of our senior citizens the army corps of engineers built field hospitals and the navy deployed our great hospital ships we developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world america has tested more than every country in europe put together and more than every nation in the western hemisphere combined think of that we have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation which is india we developed a wide array of effective treatments including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma you saw that on sunday night when we announced it that will save thousands and thousands of lives thanks to advances we have pioneered the fatality rate and you look at it and you look at the numbers it has been reduced by 80 percent since april 80 percent the united states has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world the european union\\'s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours but you don\\'t hear that they don\\'t write about that they don\\'t want to write about that they don\\'t want you to know those things all together the nations of europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the united states think of that we enacted the largest package of financial relief in american history thanks to our paycheck protection program we have saved or supported more than 50 million american jobs that\\'s one of the reasons that we\\'re advancing so rapidly with our economy great job as a result we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation and we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody over the past three months we have gained over nine million jobs and that\\'s a record in the history of our country unfortunately from the beginning our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize when i took bold action to issue a travel ban on china very early indeed joe biden called it hysterical and xenophobic and then i introduced a ban on europe very early again if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died instead of following the science joe biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country his shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation\\'s children families and citizens of all backgrounds the cost of the biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses depression alcohol addiction suicides heart attacks economic devastation job loss and much more joe biden\\'s plan is not a solution to the virus but rather it\\'s a surrender to the virus my administration has a very different approach to save as many lives as possible we are focusing on the science the facts and the data we are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk especially the elderly while allowing lower risk americans to safely return to work and to school and we want to see so many of those great states be open by democrats we want them to be open they have to be open they have to get back to work they have to get back to work and they have to get back to school most importantly we are marshaling america\\'s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time under operation warp speed we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now years ahead of what has been achieved before nobody thought it could ever be done this fast normally it would be years that we did it in a matter of a few months we\\'re producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available we will have a safe and effective vaccine this year and together we will crush the virus at the democrat convention you barely heard a word about their agenda but that\\'s not because they don\\'t have one it\\'s because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee joe biden may claim he is an ally of the light but when it comes to his agenda biden wants to keep us completely in the dark he doesn\\'t have a clue he has pledged a four trillion dollar tax hike on almost all american families which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets that we have right now will also collapse that means your 401ks that means all of the stocks that you have on the other hand just as i did in my first term i will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads i will not raise taxes i will cut them and very substantially and we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of china back to america and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves america to produce jobs overseas we will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country as i\\'ve already been doing for quite some time if you\\'ve noticed joe biden\\'s agenda is made in china my agenda is made in the usa biden has promised to abolish the production of american oil coal shale and natural gas laying waste to the economies of pennsylvania ohio texas north dakota oklahoma colorado and new mexico destroying those states absolutely destroying those states and others millions of jobs will be lost and energy prices will soar these same policies led to crippling power outages in california just last week everybody saw that tremendous power outage nobody\\'s seen anything like it but we saw that last week in california how can joe biden claim to be an ally of the like when his own party can\\'t even keep the lights on joe biden\\'s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform you can\\'t get away from this co-authored with far left senator crazy bernie sanders the biden bernie manifesto calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens implementing nationwide catch and release and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers everybody gets a lawyer come on over to our country everybody has a lawyer we have a lawyer for you that\\'s what we need is more lawyers joe biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to your giveaway he was going to give it away your health care dollars to illegal immigrants which is going to bring massive numbers of immigrants into our country massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all of the goodies that they want to give education health care everything he also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens he promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent this is in the manifesto the biden plan would eliminate america\\'s borders in the middle of a global pandemic and he\\'s even talking about taking the wall down how about that [Music] biden also vowed to oppose school choice and clothes all charter schools ripping away the ladder of opportunity for black and hispanic children in a second term i will expand charter schools and provide school choice to every family in america and we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve great people great great people joe biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable yet the party he leads supports the extreme late term abortion of defenseless babies right up until the moment of birth democrat leaders talk about moral decency but they have no problem with stopping a baby\\'s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life and then they lecture us about morality and saving america\\'s soul tonight we proudly declare that all children born and unborn have a god-given right to life during the democrat convention the words under god were removed from the pledge of allegiance not once but twice we will never do that but the fact is this is where they\\'re coming from like it or not this is where they\\'re coming from if the left gains power they will demolish the suburbs confiscate your guns and appoint justices who will wipe away your second amendment and other constitutional freedoms biden is a trojan horse for socialism if joe biden doesn\\'t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed marxists like bernie sanders and his fellow radicals and there are many there are many many we see them all the it\\'s incredible actually then how is he ever going to stand up for you he\\'s not the most dangerous aspect of the biden platform is the attack on public safety the biden bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail immediately releasing 400 000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods when asked if he supports cutting police funding joe biden replied yes absolutely when congresswoman ilhan omar called the minneapolis police department a cancer that is rotten to the root biden wouldn\\'t disavow her support and reject her endorsement he proudly displayed it shortly later on his website it in big letters make no mistake if you give power to joe biden the radical left will defund police departments all across america they will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide they will make every city look like democrat-run portland oregon no one will be safe in biden\\'s america my administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement every day police officers risk their lives to keep us safe and every year many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty one of these incredible americans was detective miostas she was part of a team of american heroes called the nypd or new york\\'s finest was very very proud to get their endorsement just the other day great people great great people they were allowed to do their job you\\'d have no crime in new york rudy giuliani knows that better than anybody thank you three years ago on the fourth of july weekend detective familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge detective familia was a single mom she recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids two years ago i stood in front of the u.s capitol alongside those beautiful children and held their grandmother\\'s hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored detective familia\\'s extraordinary life it was extraordinary detective familia\\'s three children are with us this evening genesis peter delilah we are so grateful to have you here tonight thank you very much for coming thank you very much thank you very much i promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever we must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country and that\\'s the overwhelming majority are noble courageous and honorable we have to give law enforcement our police back their power they are afraid to act they are afraid to lose their pension they are afraid to lose their jobs and by being afraid they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you and those who suffer most are the great people who they protect and who they want to protect at an even higher level when there is police misconduct the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable and it will but when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today we must never allow mob rule we can never allow marlboro in the strongest possible terms the republican party condemns the rioting looting arson and violence we have seen in democrat-run cities all like kenosha minneapolis portland chicago and new york and many others democrat run there is violence and danger in the streets of many democrat-run cities throughout america this problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to just call we\\'re ready to go in we\\'ll take care of your problem in a matter of hours just call we have to wait for the call it\\'s too bad we have to but we have to wait for the call we must always have law and order all federal crimes are being investigated prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law when the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside i signed an order immediately 10 years in prison and it was a miracle it all stopped no more statues they said that\\'s just too long as they looked at a statue i think we\\'ll rip it down then they said 10 years in prison i think that\\'s too long let\\'s go home during their convention joe biden and his supporters remain completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in democrat-run cities they never even mentioned it during their entire convention never once mentioned now they\\'re starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock and water it\\'s too late joe in the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in minneapolis chicago and other cities joe biden\\'s campaign did not condemn it they donated to it at least 13 members of joe biden\\'s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals arsonists anarchists looters and rioters from jail here tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain david dorn a 38-year veteran of the saint louis police department a great man and a highly respected man by all in june captain dorne was shot and killed as he tried to protect the store from rioters and looters or as the democrats would call them peaceful protesters they call them peaceful protesters we\\'re honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife ann and beloved family members brian and kalyn to each of you we will never forget the heroic legacy of captain david dorn thank you very much for being here thank you thank you very much great man great man as long as i am president we will defend the absolute right of every american citizen to live in security dignity and peace if the democrat party wants to stand with anarchists agitators rioters looters and flag burners that is up to them but i as your president will not be a part of it the republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep america safe and salute the american flag last year over 1 000 african americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four democrat run cities the top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by democrats and have been for many decades thousands more african-americans are victims and victims of violent crime in these communities joe biden and the left ignore these american victims i never will if the radical left takes power they will apply their disastrous policies to every city town and suburb in america just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the u.s government just think of that liberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of american institutions but who exactly is attacking them who is hiring the radical professors judges and prosecutors who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent in every case the attacks on american institutions are being waged by radical left always remember they are coming after me because i am fighting for you that\\'s what\\'s happening and it\\'s been going on from before i even got elected and remember this they spied on my campaign and they got caught let\\'s see now what happens we must reclaim our independence from the lefts repressive mandates americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words and phrases and the ever more restrictive political decrees many things have a different name now and the rules are constantly changing the goal of cancel culture is to make decent americans live in fear of being fired expelled shamed humiliated and driven from society as we know it the far left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true very sad but on november 3rd you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget thank you thank you very much joe biden is weak he takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage these same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land they want to open our borders while living in waldorf compounds and communities in the best neighborhoods in the world they wanted to fund the police while they have armed guards for themselves this november we must turn the page forever on this failed political class the fact is i\\'m here [Applause] what\\'s the name of that building but i\\'ll say it differently the fact is we\\'re here and they\\'re not to me one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world and it\\'s not a building it\\'s a home as far as i\\'m concerned not even a house it\\'s a home it\\'s a wonderful place with an incredible history but it\\'s all because of you together we will write the next chapter of the great american story over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world we will expand opportunity zones thank you tim scott bring home our medical supply chains and we will end our resilience for bad things we will go right after china we will not rely on them one bit we are taking our business out of china we are bringing it home we want our business to come home we will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before we will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months and it\\'ll be higher than that we will hire more police increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities we will ban deadly sanctuary cities and ensure that federal health care is protected for american citizens not for illegal aliens we will have strong borders and i\\'ve said for years without borders we don\\'t have a country don\\'t have a country strike down terrorists who threaten our people and keep america out of endless and costly foreign wars we will appoint prosecutors judges justices who believe in enforcing the law not enforcing their own political agenda which is illegal we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race religion color and creed we will uphold your religious liberty and defend your second amendment right to keep and bear arms and if we don\\'t win your second amendment doesn\\'t have a chance i can tell you that i have totally protected it we will protect medicare and social security we will always and very strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions and that is a pledge from the entire republican party thank you kevin we will end surprise medical billing require price transparency and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums they\\'re coming way down we will greatly expand energy development continuing to remain the number one in the world and keep america energy independent and for those of you that still drive a car look how low your gasoline bill is you haven\\'t seen that in a long time we will win the race to 5g and build the world\\'s best cyber and missile defense already under construction we will fully restore patriotic education to our schools and always protect we will always always protect free speech on college campuses [Applause] and we put a very big penalty in they do anything having to do with your free speech colleges have to pay a tremendous tremendous financial penalty and again it\\'s amazing how open they\\'ve been lately we will launch a new age of american ambition in space america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on mars this is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together so tonight i say to all americans this is the most important election in the history of our country there has never been such a difference between two parties or two individuals and ideology philosophy or vision than there is right now our opponents believe that america is a depraved nation we want our sons and daughters to know the truth america is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world our country wasn\\'t built by cancer culture speech codes and soul-crushing conformity we are not a nation of timid spirits we are a nation of fierce proud and independent american patriots we\\'re a nation of pilgrims pioneers adventurers explorers and trailblazers who refuse to be tied down held back or in any way reigned in americans have steel in their spines gritting their souls and fire in their hearts there is no one like us on earth i want every child in america to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history no matter where your family comes from no matter your background in america anyone can rise with hard work devotion and drive you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition our american ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent they braved the freezing winters crossed the raging rivers scaled the rocky peaks trekked the dangerous forests and worked from dawn till dusk these pioneers didn\\'t have money they didn\\'t have fame but they had each other they loved their families they love their country and they love their god when opportunity beckoned they picked up their bibles packed up their belongings climbed into their covered wagons and set out west for the next adventure ranchers and miners cowboys and sheriffs farmers and settlers they pressed on past the mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier legends were born why erp annie oakley davy crockett and buffalo bill americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range soon they had churches and communities then towns and with time great centers of industry and commerce that is who they were americans build their future we don\\'t tear down our past we are the nation that won a revolution toppled tyranny and fascism and delivered millions into freedom we laid down the railroads built the great ships raised up the skyscrapers revolutionized industry and sparked a new age of scientific discovery we set the trends in art and music radio and film sport and literature and we did it all with style and confidence and flair because that is who we are whenever our way of life was threatened our heroes answered the call from yorktown to gettysburg from normandy to iwo jima american patriots raced into canon blasts bullets and bayonets to rescue american liberty they had no fear but america didn\\'t stop there we looked into the sky and kept pressing onward we built a 6 million pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space we did it so the two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous american flag planted on the face of the moon for america nothing is impossible over the next four years we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy we will reach stunning new heights and we will show that the world for america there is a dream and it is not beyond

loss of poverty is staggering at this point all right we\\'ll we\\'ll be talking to you we\\'re going to be helping you with law enforcement we\\'re going to be helping you with some economic development get get it back in shape get kenosha back in shape and we\\'ll get it back in i think very quickly i really think so and we\\'ll be helped by john morrissey city administrator of kenosha john thank you very much john you have your work cut out for the next little while but you\\'ll be fine i think we do you\\'re going to be in great shape and samantha kirkman state representative district 61. thank you very much congratulations on doing a really great job thank you thank you great job you\\'re doing appreciate it and van wan guard state senator district 21 highly respected person actually thank you very much thank you very much great thank you so much for your rapid response and the fact that that you\\'re coming to a small city in the united states and just saying that that\\'s as important as every other city and the fact that we did get things under control uh this guard has been phenomenal our law enforcement people have been working together we usually work pretty well together in southeastern wisconsin yeah but this really helps and reince has a lot to do with that too you can tell because you\\'re good so thank you so much you\\'re in our prayer thank you and you your reputations a great one so thank you very much and also this this area is a special area we can\\'t let that happen to this area so we got here quickly and uh did the job violent mobs demolished or damaged at least 25 businesses burned down public buildings and threw bricks at police officers which your police officers won\\'t stand for and they didn\\'t stand for it these are not acts of peaceful protest but really domestic terror my administration coordinated with the state and local authorities to very very swiftly deploy the national guard surge federal law enforcement to kenosha and stop the violence and i strongly support the use of the national guard in other cities and the same thing would be happening if we did that you\\'d have the same thing happen in portland it would happen very quickly it would all be over very very quickly and i just want to thank the two of you for acting so strongly and so bravely and getting it done and the coordination has been fantastic you still need that coordination no matter how many people you send in i just came from a visit of one of the businesses that was burned down b l furniture and the great 109 year old camera shop which i i really respect because that was a had a reputation far beyond the state even and it\\'s terrible to see several other business owners uh they\\'re joining us and we have some in the back also to stop the political violence we must also confront the radical ideology that includes this violence reckless far-left politicians continue to push the destructive message that our nation and our law enforcement are oppressive or racist they\\'ll throw out any word that comes to them actually we must give far greater support to our law enforcement it\\'s all about giving them additional support these are great people these are great great people these are brave people they\\'re fighting to save people that they\\'ve never met before in many cases and they\\'re incredible we must really be thankful that we have them and we have to help them do their jobs we can\\'t be threatening them with their pensions are going to be taken away their job\\'s going to be taken away everything\\'s going to be taken away they\\'re going to be living a bad life if if they utter an incorrect word you can\\'t do it we have to have our law enforcement we cherish our law enforcement we wouldn\\'t be here without our law enforcement even me i\\'m here today i feel so safe and you went through hell just a few days ago but i feel so safe i better be safe i better be safe but we\\'re all safe and we\\'re safe because of law enforcement and we honor you and i will say this we have to condemn the dangerous anti-police rhetoric it\\'s getting more and more it\\'s very unfair you have some bad apples we all know that and those will be taken care of through the system and nobody\\'s going to be easy on them either and you have people that joke they\\'re under tremendous i said it yesterday i said it last night they\\'re under tremendous pressure and they may be there for 15 years and have a spotless record and all of a sudden they\\'re faced with the decision they have a quarter of a second quarter of a second to make a decision and if they make a wrong decision one way or the other they\\'re either dead or they\\'re in big trouble and people have to understand that they choke sometimes and it\\'s a very tough situation right it\\'s a very tough then people call them bad and horrible and they made a bad decision but if you think of it when they have and i know you practice this all the time where you give people uh literally a quarter of a second to make a decision and a lot of them can\\'t make that right decision it\\'s a very tough thing to do the vast and overwhelming majority of police officers are honorable courageous and devoted public servants they\\'re incredible yet many politicians ignore their sacrifice and ignore the african-american hispanic american victims we have people there was love on the streets i can tell you of wisconsin when we were coming in there was love on the streets and so many african-americans hispanic americans i can see waving pastor was so beautiful to see they want to have they want to have safety they want to have safety you look at i\\'m not a huge believer in polls obviously but you look at polls whether it\\'s 87 percent want to have great police they want to have strong police they want to have safety they\\'re the ones that are most affected by tragedies like you\\'ll see going around when these allegations of police wrongdoing and when you see that they have made allegations they must be fully and fairly investigated and that\\'s what we\\'re doing bill barr has done a fantastic job in that respect and we fully understand that because you do you do have problems the other way but there are very few you know the sad thing is you can do 10 000 great jobs as a policeman or policewoman you can do an incredible job for years and then you have one bad apple or something happens that\\'s bad and that\\'s the nightly news for three weeks that\\'s all they talk about they don\\'t talk about the thousands and thousands of good jobs the lives that you save they never talk about so i\\'m committed to helping kenosha rebuild we all are we will provide one million dollars to the kenosha law enforcement so that you have some extra money to go out and do what you have to do you took a rough it was a rough week to put it mildly and you\\'ve done it incredibly well i\\'m also providing nearly four million dollars to support these small businesses that i talked about today that got burned up burned down and we\\'re going to be providing over 42 million dollars to support public safety statewide including direct support for law enforcement and funding for additional prosecutors to punish criminals and resources to provide services to victims of crime and that was bill barr wanted that money put in so that\\'s 42 million dollars that will help with prosecutors and all of the other things that are so important to you you need that because when you when you grab them and then nothing happens and they\\'re back on the street that doesn\\'t work out too well my administration is restoring public safety we\\'re hiring more police surging tough one crime federal prosecutors increasing penalties for assaulting law enforcement and for dismantling antifa it doesn\\'t they don\\'t want to mention the word antifa nobody mentions that there\\'s a bad group of people very very bad very dangerous group of people and we are doing a big number on antifa they\\'re bad earlier this year we announced operation legend to surge federal law enforcement to high crime neighborhoods it is a thing that has really worked out amazingly well bill but it\\'s really under sort of really understated in a sense we we\\'ve already conducted more than one 000 arrests in our first month in chicago we went to chicago very recently obviously that\\'s been a disaster chicago total disaster with again radical left democrat and we just have to straight it\\'s all democrat everything\\'s democrat all of these problems are democrat cities we don\\'t want to say it but it is the top ten or democrat then you go into the top 25 and take a look at that it\\'s the same thing we cut the number of murders in chicago last month in half still way too many but the operation legend was very very very successful now it\\'s just really getting going but they cut it in half and just at its very early stage this in sharp contrast to those who want to slash police funding oppose using the national guard and want to hire radical judges and prosecutors who will release riders looters and criminals we have that in portland where the prosecutors don\\'t want to do anything you can catch somebody doing the worst crime and they don\\'t want to do anything so we\\'re very very uh not going to be cut police funding we want to increase police funding substantially they want to end cash bail which has been a killer for new york if you look at what\\'s happening in new york they allow thousands of people out of jail in new york and they\\'re walking around and they\\'re causing nothing but problems who would not know that you don\\'t have to know anything about policing i\\'m not a policeman but i would know that if you let these people out many of them are going to cause tremendous problems so they want to end cash bail incentivize prison closures they want to close the prison so that can\\'t hold anybody reimagine public safety end immigration enforcement resume catch and release at the border uh as uh chad will tell you we\\'ve had tremendous success on the border we\\'re up to over 300 miles of border wall and we\\'re having the best year we\\'ve ever had in the border people are coming in but they only come in legally or they for the most part they only come in illegally the wall will be finished very shortly it\\'s had a tremendous impact so and the other thing we want to appoint supreme court justices and judges we\\'ll be up to almost 300 judges by the end of the term and two supreme court justices and so we have a lot of things to do we have a lot of great things to do but it\\'s an honor to be in your neighborhood it\\'s an honor to be in your great state wisconsin and we\\'re here for you all the way some people thought it would be a good thing for me to come a bad thing i just wanted to come i really came today to thank law enforcement and to just really that what they what you\\'ve done has been incredible it\\'s been really inspiring because you see it happening all over and it just never seems to end and it never seems to end because it\\'s almost as though they don\\'t want it to end because you ended it really fast and congressman i want to thank you for the job you did you were the first call and i want to thank you very much brian great really great job with that i\\'d like to introduce bill barr attorney general of the united states say a few words thank you thank you mr president um as most of you know whenever there is an officer involved shooting in our country uh it\\'s reviewed by local uh authorities uh to ensure that it was reasonable force and when there are questions raised about it the federal government also the justice department also reviews it and like all procedures and processes in our country we do it under due process and we try to reach a dispassionate reasoned decision based on an analysis of the situation we do not allow judgments to be reached because of mob violence we do not have mob violence in this country make our decisions over the fate of individuals when when their actions are challenged and when the shooting occurred uh here in kenosha under the direction of the president we told the dod the defense department to get ready some national guard units in case they were needed to help here and from several states volunteered to supply national guard if they were needed and the president directed me to assemble a group of federal law enforcement that could be dispatched here uh which we did and staged them in chicago and we were picking up information that that these violent instigators were coming to kenosha they were coming from california washington state a lot from chicago and they were coming up to kenosha so we expected matters to get worse the violence that erupted shortly after the shooting is simply not a legitimate response to a police shooting and the looting and the arson were unacceptable and as it progressed it became more and more distant from the issue of racial justice it was violence for violence sake and once again we saw the hijacking of a protest by a hardcore group of of radicals who were carrying out planning a coordinated violent attack on law enforcement on public property and on private property and that can\\'t be tolerated these are the the same people many of them who came from out of town out of 175 arrests a hundred were from out of town and some these are the same people using the same tactics that have been used in various cities washington dc atlanta chicago now kenosha portland and they use these black block tactics throwing projectiles at police and literally trying to inflict injuries on police arson and rioting they came equipped as even the mayor of washington acknowledged they come equipped to fight and it\\'s completely unacceptable and the state is the first line of defense if if local leaders are committed to keeping the public safe it can be done and while it was slow in getting off the starting block this is an example that when you have the local political leadership backing the police you have the state willing to put in the resources in terms of national guard and the federal government able to come up uh with support such as the fbi the marshals and atf who have some special skills and forensic ability to help there will be peace on the streets and there\\'s going to be accountability what people don\\'t see is that in all of these cities there are task forces of federal and state officers reviewing all the video that we can get our hands on and when we are able to identify people who committed crimes in these riots going all the way back to the beginning whether they\\'re burning police cars or throwing rocks at people which are deadly they will be prosecuted that\\'s a large-scale effort and it\\'s going to continue so i can i can tell you mr president that as far as the federal government is concerned we welcome the opportunity to work with state and local to deal with this public safety issue law enforcement is used to working together we do a good job when we\\'re allowed to work together this is no different than dealing with violent crime where we work together we can achieve results and the federal government is willing to use all our tools and all our laws to bring these people to justice thank you thank you very much you\\'re doing a great job bill thank you senator ron johnson from your wonderful state and he is one of the great senators i can tell you that in the u.s senate he\\'s one of the best ron please there\\'s no doubt what you\\'ve been talking about in terms of the decisiveness the resolve the surging of resources i think 44 different counties sent representatives from different sheriff departments that really helped stop the rioting and and bring pieces the streets but we have you know pastor ward and his wife and and i reached out because i was just so appreciative of julie jackson\\'s words of forgiveness and of healing and so you combine the proper role of law enforcement the support for law enforcement with people that also want to end the violence that are willing to forgive and are willing to offer those words of healing so i thought that was very powerful i was really appreciative offer those words forgiveness and trying to attain that type of unity and healing so again mr president i thank you for coming here for for coming here to thank law enforcement to support law enforcement but also coming here just to support the citizens of kenosha and wisconsin as we rebuild as as we recover from something that the vast majority people abhor and do not support thank you very much ron appreciate it congressman please brian style mr president i appreciate you being here as events spiraled out of control um people started calling me they were scared they were nervous they were concerned about their safety their family\\'s safety their home their place of employment and they were looking for where to turn it was very clear from talking to folks here in the city of kenosha local elected leaders that we needed additional resources in the community of kenosha immediately that\\'s ultimately why i called you on tuesday morning and after only seven minutes you got on the phone with me you said brian i\\'m there for the people of kenosha and the people of kenosha everyone that called me wanted public safety here in this community and they wanted it immediately they didn\\'t care if the help was democrat republican or from the man on the moon but what you did is made the call and said enough\\'s enough we need to get resources into the community of kenosha and ultimately when that offer was accepted i think it became very clear to the criminal element that they knew that kenosha meant business we made some significant arrests in conjunction with local law enforcement working very well with the federal government hand in glove when i talked to folks in law enforcement here in kenosha and when the federal government works hand in hand with the state and with local government you can get a lot done and i think it speaks volumes about the people here in the community of kenosha this is a hard-working family loving town that wants safety in their community and one more piece is i\\'ve had the opportunity to talk to a lot of the men and women in law enforcement those on the front lines i spoke to a gentleman that had a brick thrown at him i\\'ve spoken to law enforcement officers who had horrific words said about them and these men and women are members of our community that wake up every day put the badge over their heart walk out the door sworn to answer the call to protect our community and i think you coming and saying thank you to those men and women in law enforcement speaks volumes and today we have public safety restored we appreciate all the work you did on that and now we begin the work of healing and rebuilding kenosha to make kenosha stronger than it\\'s ever been before we thank you very much for being here thank you brian great job david beth sheriff please mr president thank you so much for being here um when this started sunday night we knew it was going to get worse but we really didn\\'t know how bad and there\\'s no way that one or in our case two agencies can work together to fight what happened when we put out the call initially to the state and local law enforcement here it was a tremendous response but it still wasn\\'t enough on monday night the national guard started coming on monday night and started helping us and their numbers kept growing and we called brian on tuesday morning early the the leaders of kenosha and we said we\\'ll take help from whoever will send it our way will we want to protect the people of kenosha the city of kenosha the county of kenosha we want to protect it and brian said i\\'m going to make a phone call and a short time later we knew that the resources of the of the united states of the federal government and of the president were on its way and we we knew that it took a little a little uh uh discussion between state and federal levels and but we\\'re very thankful that it worked out because as i said i didn\\'t care who i got help from i wanted resources here and after it was approved uh and i got the word that the president said whatever you need it\\'s coming and i had some of uh some very very important people from washington tell me the president i have to report to the president mr barr and tell him what does the sheriff want and and the resources just kept coming the people kept coming the uh the gratitude kept coming for and i heard stories and i probably shouldn\\'t share this but some people that were in portland that weren\\'t treated as good as they were treated here and they said we can\\'t believe what a different place this is because of how we all worked together rather than not wanting to work together at all so thank you for being the president that likes law enforcement on behalf of law enforcement i\\'m telling you the group that\\'s here i hope you could feel the love that they have for you and everybody who came and and uh it\\'s quite an operation to watch to be part of in truth my life my life i never thought i would see anything like this and hopefully i never have to see this again but the resources that that in this case the federal government and you provided and mr barr and and mr johnson and the people here it\\'s unbelievable what we have here right now and uh it\\'s all to protect the people of kenosha and and uh i still i\\'ll take any help i can get and i thank you for it thank you sheriff i\\'ll tell you you\\'ve done a great job and you know just if they\\'re watching portland or chicago or new york or any one of other cities that we\\'re talking about but portland probably would be so easy maybe that would be the first one because i see it every night it\\'s on the news it\\'s burning they\\'re always playing games and i don\\'t know then he gets up and says we\\'re trying to work together and the whole thing is great then they want to burn down his house last night the mayor but we\\'re ready willing and able to send in you know a massive group of people that are really highly trained you saw that they\\'re here your experience right and we could solve that problem in less than an hour in portland so i hope they call eventually they\\'ll call and at some point bill would just have to do it ourselves we\\'re gonna have to do something that\\'s uh that i think the people will be extremely happy with maybe the mayor won\\'t and maybe the governor won\\'t but i don\\'t know if they know what they\\'re doing i just so sad to watch it happen but here you acted and acted appropriately please daniel go ahead mr president first of all thank you for the support thank you for coming to what is uh small town america kenosha\\'s 100 000 people by national standards we\\'re still small but what you also have here is a reaction to was an attack on small town america the tactics that are being used across this nation to attack law enforcement are warfare type tactics and we still use restraint and function within our rules so those two together there\\'s not a there\\'s not a tit for attack those aren\\'t equal so with the ability of the national guard to come out and assist us with the tremendous outpouring of support from the federal assets from every department that has come out we will excuse me we were able to restore peace and we\\'re working toward order and and healing and growth and as part of what is going on in the world police scrutiny is not a bad thing police or attacks on the police and the things that are happening that lead to riots that\\'s not about police scrutiny that\\'s not about anything else those are those are legitimate attacks so what worked for us was we certainly had a unified command we had a unified mission that normally takes some time to build but instantly between myself and the sheriff and the local leaders the city administration county we pulled together we worked with the city we worked with state we worked with officers from southeast of here and there\\'s not a lot southeast of wisconsin or kenosha to the northwest corner of the state we have people from two steps away from canada sending officers down here so the response here in the law enforcement community was tremendous and everybody i talked to was here to help restore peace and order for the good people of kenosha and thank you for helping us thank you daniel great job you did thank you and you two worked together beautifully it\\'s really good really good job uh please chad well thank you mr president uh americans need and deserve both law enforcement and public safety regardless of where they live regardless of their politics the decrease in violence that we\\'ve seen here in kenosha over the last several days is really just a prime example of how federal state and local law enforcement can work together it\\'s really a model that we can replicate elsewhere portland and other cities across the country and this administration mr president you\\'ve been very clear if cities need help they need assistance if they need resources and capabilities beyond their reach all they have to do is call law enforcement the federal government and we will be there dhs partners not only with the department of justice but with local communities every day to protect the citizens of those communities we\\'re providing law enforcement here in kenosha some assistance uh until you\\'re able to rebuild and get back on your feet so um certainly want to uh extend our appreciation for what you do and let me just say um the attacks on law enforcement recently have been very vocal about that uh are very disgusting we need to thank our men and women of law enforcement they put on a badge and a uniform every day they\\'re attacked every day for simply wearing that uniform and doing their job so again on behalf of the 240 000 men and women of the department i want to say thank you to the local law enforcement for doing your job and protecting your communities thank you really nice thank you pastors would you like to say a prayer yes sir i\\'d love to have that uh because you are so highly thought of in the area so please james sharon you still pray please father we come to you in the name of our lord jesus christ and we thank you for this time that you\\'ve divinely ordained father we ask you to forgive us all where we\\'ve strayed from your ways and well we\\'ve not acknowledged your word we ask that you would continue to cause this nation to be one nation under god that you alone are the one who can make us individual indivisible and by being indivisible there will be liberty and justice for all we simply pray that you would bring our nation back to you that your word will be dominant that you would cause us to walk in love to live in love restore empathy and compassion kindness concern for each other lord i pray for our president as your word says that you would strengthen him and continue to give him the wisdom and the heart to lead during this time as well as as all the leaders that are here we give ourselves to you and we ask you for your good hand to be upon us in the name of jesus our lord we pray amen amen thank you very much sharon would you like to say something i i would um i think i\\'m here first of all representing intercessors and people that are praying just really i think we need to mobilize people in prayer to pray for this country and also i think it\\'s important to have black people at the table um to help you know solve the problem and also um i think james and i are our prayers that we\\'re able to work to really bring about a change i think there\\'s a lot of great change that\\'s been mentioned here of how law enforcement has quickly solved the problem of the crime in the street but i think there\\'s i think this is a good opportunity for us to really solve the problem the nation and um i think james and i could help with that so that\\'s really well put yes james mr president if i may add being the only pastors in the room if i could maybe just share a little bit from a different perspective that i think would bring balance i have a great friend who is chief tony scarpelli the chief of police in the town where our church is right and i talk about the partnership between pastors and police and i often tell tony that if we can do our job well it will make his his job easier that\\'s because there are three types of law that govern society there\\'s spiritual law moral law and civil law most of the conversation here today has been about civil law but until we can really focus on spiritual and moral law and change the hearts of people we\\'ll have to continue to to build bigger jails and bigger princes prisons until we can bring our nation back to the place of spiritual and moral law we certainly want to honor julia jackson we\\'re her pastors we\\'re not the pastor of the entire family but on her you know yes sir i will give her your regards and we certainly pray for jacob\\'s continued healing and we pray for peace but i just want to offer to you mr president that um jesus himself says blessed are the peacemakers and we want to help be of service to you and to our nation of having these conversations of how do we rebuild the foundations of spirituality and morality which gives us the context of of love if you give a righteous good moral man the launch goes to our nuclear arsenal everyone will be safe because he\\'s a good man but if you give a malicious man who is immoral an ink pen you have to fear for your life i i would just want to want to say that we\\'re here to be of service to you and to our country to bring unity we believe that we can help to listen with empathy and compassion to the real pain that that hurts black americans but we want to be of service to you and to our nation to do whatever we can to bring true healing true peace and to really see god\\'s very best in our nation we\\'re here available we\\'re available anytime you will call upon us so you know what i think i think you\\'re an incredible couple i really do i think you\\'re an incredible couple thank you and thank you very much for being here yes sir really really great beautiful uh do you have any questions you\\'d like to please in federal agents for cities like portland no it\\'s not but yeah no it\\'s not it\\'s just that we\\'re tired of watching every night with portland they\\'re on night 104 now and we\\'re tired of watching it because it could be solved in an hour and we\\'re tired of watching a mayor that has no clue what\\'s going on and people are calling our office and people are calling washington that live in portland and live in the state and they\\'re saying please please send help and the governor we call the governor often and they say no we don\\'t need your help but i say your community is burning down they don\\'t need our help now i don\\'t know if that\\'s political i don\\'t know what is going on certainly not common sense but we can solve it just like here we all work together we came in the federal government the state government the city government everybody worked together the senator the congressman it was like a beautiful thing it just came it just worked and it was done almost instantly people were amazed and as you probably will have to report maybe people are surprised there\\'s been zero problem in terms of your safety our safety i feel so safe four four or five days ago james we couldn\\'t have done this the law enforcement\\'s been so great and we could do this in portland so quickly so easily it would it would be incredible we would have done it in seattle we were all set to go into seattle as you know the following day and they heard that and they sent the police and the police did a good job but they the people gave up they were exhausted they were there for a long time and they gave up they were exhausted so we\\'re there i mean we\\'d love to help oregon we\\'d love to help really love to help portland because we could solve that problem so easily we have the people there ready they could be there in less than an hour less than an hour and it would all end and they got a glimpse of that in this great state they got a really good glimpse of it it happened very quickly and now i mean i see it they\\'re already rebuilding you\\'re already rebuilding your stores you\\'ll be rebuilding your store soon your camera shop so uh we don\\'t want to do that but at some point we\\'re going to have to do it we\\'re going to have to do it okay can you tell me what you would say to the blake family i know you didn\\'t get a chance to talk to them but what would you say to them in terms of the pain they\\'re going through and the questions they have about what happened well i feel terribly for anybody that goes through that that\\'s why i was so honored to meet the pastors uh i feel terribly for anybody that goes through that as you know it\\'s under investigation it\\'s a big thing happening right now i guess it\\'s under local investigation i know bill you\\'re also participating but it\\'s under your local investigation group unit and i hope they come up with the right answer it\\'s a complicated subject to be honest with you but i feel terribly for anybody that has to go through and i didn\\'t get to speak to the mother i hear she\\'s a fine woman i\\'ve heard that from the pastor a really fine woman but you can see when i spoke to the pastors i see exactly what it is and they understand where i am and if we can help we\\'re going to help but it is a question it\\'s under investigation a lot of things happened with that and other things frankly that we\\'re looking at very very closely okay should every police officer in the united states wear a body camera body cam uh well that\\'s very interesting let me ask bill to answer that question go ahead well generally that\\'s that\\'s a local uh issue for each police force in each community the political leaders of a community to decide upon but i think most law enforcement people i know uh who were originally skeptical of body cameras are now coming around to feeling that they actually are a net benefit it\\'s a very tough you know it\\'s a very the whole thing with a body cam you read it and you read two sides of the story how do you feel about it daniel i believe that body cameras would be very helpful for you you think they\\'re good i believe they show both sides where right now officers would be vindicated for some of the things that they\\'ve been accused of and certainly if there were inappropriate actions those would be captured but you overall i support them how about you we\\'re good with it or it\\'s already been put into the budget for 2021 and uh okay so you\\'ll be having them we\\'ll be having them okay good they like them questions um the problem of police violence has been described as just the problem of a few bad apples repeatedly you\\'re gonna have to speak up please yeah uh the problem of police violence has been described by you including president uh as just bad apples few bad apples or people who choke occasionally some african-american community leaders and a lot of others actually have said it\\'s systemic where do you stand on that i don\\'t believe that no i don\\'t believe that i think the police do an incredible job and i think you do have some bad apples i think you\\'d agree every once in a while you\\'ll see something and and you do have the other situation too where they\\'re under this tremendous pressure and they they don\\'t handle it well they call it choking and it happens and no but i don\\'t believe that at all i think they\\'re i\\'ve met so many police i have the endorsement of like so many maybe everybody and frankly i think they\\'re incredible people they want to do the right thing it\\'s a tough job it\\'s a tough job it\\'s a dangerous job but i have to say this to the police the the people of our country love you you don\\'t hear that you don\\'t hear it from them but the people of our country love you and they respect you and they and you know it you feel it in your heart or you wouldn\\'t be doing it or you wouldn\\'t be doing it but there\\'s a great love and when they see what goes on and when they see a case like this where it\\'s solved so quickly they respect the police a lot really a lot so you should hear it at least follow on that um we\\'re focusing on violent uh actions but there have been countless non-violent protests here in wisconsin and across the country this summer uh people calling for an end to systemic racism do you believe systemic racism is a problem in this country well you know you just keep getting back to the opposite subject we should talk about the kind of violence that we\\'ve seen in portland and here and other places it\\'s tremendous violence you always get to the other side well what do you think about this or that the fact is that we\\'ve seen tremendous violence and we will put it out very very quickly if given the chance and that\\'s what this is all about yeah i keep hearing about peaceful protests i hear it about everything and then i come into an area like this and i see the town is burned down i mean you look at minneapolis they should have acted much quicker when we got the national guard in there it took literally a half an hour you saw the scene they formed they walked it was over and they haven\\'t had a problem of any consequence since their police weren\\'t allowed to do the job that they could do they\\'re very good police department but they weren\\'t now they want to break it up they want to end it they don\\'t want to have a police department they want to not only defund they want to get rid of it it\\'s ridiculous so i just say this that the kind of violence that i saw you may have protesters but you have some really bad people too you have anarchists and you have the looters and you have the writers you have all types you have agitators and that\\'s what you should be focusing on with your question i keep hearing about peaceful protests it\\'s become really i think it\\'s hurt the media very badly because you\\'ll have somebody standing on one of the networks i won\\'t say which one but there are more than one many of them seeing how it\\'s a peaceful protest and over the shoulder you see the whole place is burning down it\\'s become a pretty common sight so i don\\'t view the peaceful protest i think peaceful protesting is fantastic i think it\\'s great but by and large this is not peaceful protest when you walk into a an area and you see buildings that have burned down and fortunately here we stopped it early and so the damage is relatively minimal but when you look at some of these areas that they just don\\'t ask for the help they refuse to allow us to go in and help them and by the time you get there the place is is disintegrated and then they say it was a peaceful protest it\\'s not a peaceful protest and you shouldn\\'t call it a peaceful protest okay one more please answer my question my question was to the pastors say it again the peaceful protests that have happened you\\'re gonna have to speak up the peaceful protests that have happened you\\'ve acknowledged some of them are peaceful they\\'re calling for structural change mr blake was shot i mean seven times in the back do you believe that there is a need for structural change what is your message well i think people are calling for structural change and then you could take the people of kenosha that aren\\'t here and that you won\\'t see and that aren\\'t protesting but they want change also they want to see law and order that\\'s the change they want they want law and order they want the police to be police they want the police to do what they do better than anybody else in the world and that\\'s what they want too you don\\'t see them marching and you don\\'t see them on the streets but what they want is they want great police force they want people that are going to keep them safe where their houses aren\\'t broken into where they\\'re not raped and murdered that\\'s what they want and they\\'re protesters too but they don\\'t walk down the street up and down the street so you know just the way it is just the way it is so i want to thank you all and i\\'ll see you back at the plane thank you very much thank you thank you great job fantastic job thank you everybody thank you very much appreciate it me [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music]

carolina and god bless america thank you all very much thank [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] i was given a video of donald trump during a break in the deposition in the trump university fraud case and he doesn\\'t know the camera\\'s running and he and his lawyer dan petrocelli have a conversation here\\'s my full commentary on this hot mic video let\\'s see what happened job thank you i feel like and you\\'re not even complaining and that it\\'s a tough record to get down now as you can tell we can\\'t hear everything so well there\\'s a lot of room noise so it comes in and out what we can hear you know bits of conversation sometimes clearer than other bits of conversation yeah you know we\\'re going to want the whole [Music] yes don\\'t worry about it i have been under control the lawyers for the other side have not come back to the room that\\'s what they\\'re waiting on that\\'s someone sort of friendly with that yes so your name is eileen um obviously trump doesn\\'t look happy to be here there\\'s a chit chat going on he\\'s you know they they had a big blow up before they took this break he\\'s waiting for the lawyers on the other side to get back so he can get done with this and he is suffering through this is [Music] oh so you know they\\'re arguing about how long he\\'s going to be there um another hour today then two more hours and another time and i\\'m just looking at the transcript here that we made of this um you know he\\'s well he\\'s going to get into talking about the case see now he just said and it\\'s kind of hard to hear he said you know they made this personal they made this person now he\\'s not talking about personal in terms of attacking him he\\'s talking about the fact that he\\'s been held personally responsible for the accused fraud at trump university and so he\\'s asking his lawyer you know how can this be a personal case i have a corporation you know that\\'s why we have corporations so i can\\'t be sued it\\'s kind of what he\\'s saying and his lawyer is saying well you know um you know this is what happened and this is how you know the judge did not throw this out and this is uh how how the case is going forward um but what do you say here that um um you know everywhere he goes every this is classic trump right everywhere we\\'ve asked they say how could it be so personal we\\'ve asked all these in other words we\\'ve asked all the attorneys and no one can get this no one can get this um and you know you\\'ll see you know he goes on in the spain you have one more shot because they\\'re saying i don\\'t even get so there he says i have hundreds of cases and i don\\'t ever get sued personally and the lawyer says well that\\'s because in this case they are saying you are personally involved in making false statements and if you look at the video the promotional videos of for trump university at trump university we teach success that\\'s what it\\'s all about success it\\'s going to happen to you trump university was one of the many failed business ventures of donald trump it was set up to sell people the secrets of his success but it didn\\'t work out that way for a lot of the people who took the courses and they sued they sued donald trump personally because he put out promotional material saying that he hand-picked the instructors who knew how they could teach you how to be like him we\\'re going to have professors and adjunct professors that are absolutely terrific we are going to have the best of the best and honestly if you don\\'t learn from them if you don\\'t learn from me if you don\\'t learn from the people that we\\'re going to be putting forward and these are all people that are hand-picked by me then you\\'re just not going to make it in terms of the world of success and now he\\'s claiming well i didn\\'t know that much about it\\'s classic trump okay so that was hard to hear again but now they\\'re talking about the judge george gonzalo curiel who\\'s handling the case and trump asks his lawyer is he an asshole or and we can\\'t make out what\\'s on the other side of the ore and the lawyer says ladder i think and then trump says you really think so you know him a little bit don\\'t you and let\\'s hear what the lawyer says you know him a little bit i did it again he said he\\'s from the wrong side of the aisle too that\\'s not helping so he says he\\'s an average judge he\\'s then he was appointed by a democrat so that\\'s not going to help you now the next bit that comes on is very intriguing let\\'s see if you can make it out and um then i\\'ll say what what tell you what it is so what trump says right after the lawyer says you know he\\'s the democrat that doesn\\'t help trump says what about the spanish thing then there\\'s some words that are really hard to to make out so the question obviously is what\\'s the spanish thing that he\\'s talking about now you might remember a few months later he accused you know he said the judge was a donald trump hater was after him because he had been born in mexico his name is gonzalo curiel wrong he was born in indiana so he wasn\\'t mexican but this seems to suggest that early on trump wanted to make an argument maybe even the courtroom maybe in front of the judge that the judge was biased against him [Music] so he just said with this guy nothing nothing so he\\'s looking for some angle here to undermine challenge when it when the case after this against this judge and but as of now nothing well that\\'s why you have to strike [Music] okay so now trump is saying to the lawyer you know what do you think how are we going to win this case is this a good case and he goes if we have to try it i think we\\'ll win because juries like you because you\\'re honest that\\'s what the lawyer says and then trump is going to like press him further on whether this case is winnable do you think it\\'s an easy one um so trump says it\\'s an easy case and the lawyer says i put it at about 50 percent now they\\'re going to talk about an earlier part of the case where they were arguing about damages and whether you could do the damages in the class action way whether every individual had to come forward to claim their own damages if they lose the case and by the way we also need to deal with the damages separately right i like how trump is still looking for a win right they got the judge to agree with him on one a point about damages and he\\'s going isn\\'t this a great win isn\\'t it a great win uh but the big win they didn\\'t get was when the judge certified this as a class action case meaning you don\\'t have to you know you round up the plaintiffs you have one big case and you have to break it into a lot of little cases so it\\'s really stronger if you can have a class action case because now everybody\\'s gotta come and improve their own individuals so now they\\'re asking where the other lawyers are they\\'re they\\'ve been waiting for five minutes and they\\'re getting impacted ten minutes by the way it was five minutes not 10. we were here for half an hour at lunch one of the lawyers on the other side said we waited for you for half an hour this is really fascinating and i wish we could hear more uh it\\'s not just your ears you know they go back to what they were talking about and trump says something like go there and say we can\\'t make it out that thing about him you understand let\\'s go and do that thing do that thing say that thing and the lawyer dan petruccio is going to say i\\'ll give it a shot i\\'ll see what i can do so there\\'s another thing and they\\'re going to talk about it later all right can we give that a shot after this why don\\'t you do anything more than that and there he\\'s still talking about something we don\\'t fully you know comprehend because boom maybe you\\'ll get lucky just a reminder uh this deposition began about 10 a.m in the morning it is now shortly after 4 p.m so trump has been going through this for about six hours with some breaks uh and now he\\'s talking to his chief security guy body man keith schiller seems to say any calls upstairs go on go and check check with the phone yeah [Music] and here he back to complaining i\\'ve had some crazy cases this shouldn\\'t be much of a case do you know where the rest of these lawyers are um yeah i haven\\'t seen them they might be the black guy i\\'m gonna go get them yeah i would like to get rolling i think you should put on the record yeah we left and we came back when did we start our break and here we\\'re back to arguing about who took a longer break during the day uh remember we\\'re this is in a conference room at trump tower they\\'ve obviously put up some screen behind there to block out whatever we might see of this room and the lawyers are off on the other side or off they\\'re trying to print something out and they\\'re having trouble doing that for five minutes what do you have yeah it\\'s fighting after my um computers i can\\'t tell but is trump actually winding his watch there does he have does he wear a watch you have to wind i don\\'t know and now while he\\'s waiting he\\'s going to ask dan pacelli about a man named barack it\\'s not barack obama i believe it seems to be tom barrack who is a wealthy republican fundraiser friend of donald trump someone who raised a lot of money for him who he\\'s known a long time and he\\'s going to be surprised by some news about this close personal friend of his he didn\\'t know that his friend tom barrack had gotten married sometime the previous year and what was the first question he asked i don\\'t know if you caught that but the first question he asked was is she beautiful and petrochelli says young yeah she\\'s 38 she\\'s 37.38 how long does he live he was actually 69 at the time he gets a kick out of his focus with everything on your mind i don\\'t know how you\\'re doing this i really feel bad for you now that\\'s either a very empathetic lawyer or someone who\\'s kissing you know what that\\'s dan petricelli\\'s saying with everything on your mind i don\\'t know how you\\'re doing this i feel really bad for you there have been a problem with the printer but they\\'ll be here in two minutes again okay printing something easier yeah okay if okay so here we have him going back to the issue of how strong a case is this and he says to petruccelli you ever do better than 50 meaning do you ever tell your clients that you have a better than 50 percent chance of winning the case he goes um well we just heard pepper chelly say you never go above 70 in a case so if you think you have a lock you still don\\'t tell your client it\\'s a lock trump asked him and petrochelli says i have never gone above 75 percent now trump is going to think about this and then talk about how he describes his own chances to win the republican nomination remember it\\'s december 2015 he\\'s when he\\'s leading in the polls but there have been no votes yet somebody said what\\'s your chances of getting the nomination even though i\\'m so trump says if they don\\'t ask him his chances of getting the nomination he says 50 percent because he\\'s at 40 in the polls at the time that may or may not be true i can go back and look and he says but i don\\'t want to say i\\'m going to get it so this is one of the stronger you read this this is a pretty uh key line here because trump is pushing to say it\\'s a lock and he says um well i would rate this this is he the attorney dan petrachelli i would rate this as above average i\\'ve but i\\'ve had stronger cases and one reason it\\'s not he\\'s not giving trump a stronger prediction is because he says your guys were quote a little sloppy and here it\\'s hard to see here what trump\\'s saying seems to be can you do something on another so it doesn\\'t affect me now they\\'re just talking about some details about the case ever before but the one thing that uh you know looks really good it\\'s cool he had all kinds of monitors he had a legal compliance program and now trump is going to say you know basically this is all bunk look at what i did for these people so here trump is saying everybody who\\'s involved in trump university was so professional and the people who went there walked out with books and charts and piles of stuff i think you\\'ll be better than 50 percent now they\\'re going to talk about trump is bringing this up how the better business bureau which reviews businesses charities nonprofits treated trump university okay so he says the better business bureau gave it an a then he lowers his voice and he says something we can\\'t make out and he says gave it a d a d do you know what that is it\\'s a kill for you and he goes on so now he\\'s saying and you can\\'t make out all the words but somebody called them up presumably the better business bureau and said again he\\'s lowing his voice i\\'m going to sue you an a they got an a got the d removed here he goes back you know he\\'s telling the story again do you know we were rated d he was a big then they get interrupted by the lawyer for the other side and that\\'s basically the end of the conversation is they get ready to go into the deposition but um in this case it seems as if trump is bragging that they got a d to an a by threatening to sue the better business bureau we\\'ve called the better business bureau to ask what happened and i haven\\'t heard from them but a few months later during one of the res republican presidential primary debates megan kelly when she was a fox news host asked him about the d rating that the better business bureau had received and trump got all huffy and said no we got an a we got an a and and then during the break he was waving a piece of paper at some of the journalists there saying we just got this the better business bureau just sent this in and shows that we got an a days later the better better business bureau said we didn\\'t send anything in and they explained that his rating or the trump university rating had vacillated between d minus and an a uh but what happens is their bad ratings are based usually on complaints that people send in to the bet of these business bureau but complaints roll off uh a business or subject after three years or so so they said in 2014 2015 or so the rating for trump university went up to an a well it closed in 2010. so what happened was you know it wasn\\'t really operating anymore and the complaints rolled off they had brought it down to a d minus and that\\'s why it rose to an a apparently no complaints may make you and give you an a rating it\\'s pretty easy a to make it seems but so you know that\\'s a bit of a different story than what trump is telling here about the threat of a lawsuit somehow raising the grade is he bragging is he telling the truth we don\\'t know sorry i\\'m trying to print but it\\'s not working i\\'m just going to do it verbally is it my machine\\'s fault it is terrible that\\'s right that\\'s okay let\\'s go back to the details and now the elevator and here they went back to the deposition and one of the first things they did once they got back on the record was argue about who took a longer break and the lawyers the plaintiff said we waited for you for half an hour at lunch time petrochelli said well you know we gave you you know at least you could eat the free food we gave you apparently they provided lunch for them and the lawyer for the plaintiff said no we didn\\'t eat it and trump says what you didn\\'t eat my food and they got back into it for the full story in all the videos go to motherjones.com [Music] you [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so thank you pennsylvania very much i\\'m thrilled to be in latrobe the home of the late great my friend arnold palmer what a great guy he was what a great guy thank you very much 61 days from now we\\'re going to win the commonwealth of pennsylvania and we are going to win four more years in the white house [Music] joe biden wants to surrender your jobs to china you know that his son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing right he wants to surrender your nation to the radical left-wing mob he\\'s trying to change now you know he\\'s saying that\\'s not working because we\\'re going up and he\\'s dropping like a rocking water [Applause] and before the china virus this election was over now i had to go back to work and we\\'ve done a great job on it we don\\'t get the credit we don\\'t get the crap we made a lot of governors look very good but i will keep you jobs in america and i\\'ll bring riders looters violent extremists anarchists we will bring them to justice that\\'s what we\\'re doing right

have you\\'re going to have an incredible economic year next year your stocks are going up your 401ks are through the roof had a little pause today people wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way but uh the stock market\\'s at record levels think of it in the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic we\\'re rounding that turn and vaccines are coming along great you know that the job that they\\'ve done the doctors everybody else we\\'re years ahead of schedule anybody else as president you wouldn\\'t be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now i\\'ll tell you right now that i can tell you biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family he is a puppet of the socialists marxists and the cop-hating extremists and they are cop-hating and we love our law enforcement we love our life and by the way we have i don\\'t know if you saw this if there\\'s any way of you seeing it we have thousands of people behind this hangar thousands and we\\'re trying to get them in and i\\'d love to get them in i mean it\\'s an airport let them go to the runways okay [Music] let them in we have i mean literally there we landed i actually thought that was the crowd you know we\\'re doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can\\'t do it because of the pandemic for a while a little while but in certain ways i like this better i don\\'t have to travel i get off the plane i make a speech i get the hell out of here naughties are great you remember the last days before the campaign i\\'d do a lot of them a day get off that plane it was a little different plan it was black and white instead of the blue and white but we had some time and that was an important that was an important day and that was an important year 2016 but i will tell you the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country and we had a level of enthusiasm i mean even look today with all going on look at look at the kind of crowds we have but we had record enthusiasm in 2016. by the way was that the greatest evening ever november and now it\\'s going to be november 3rd and we\\'ll keep it going and we\\'ll get it all like a tree you move that tree it takes a little while to plant your tax cuts they\\'re going to raise your taxes they\\'re going to take away your guns it\\'s really if you look and you know they\\'ll criticize me for saying this the fake news media which is back there with their fake with their fake polls the same as leisure we could just put it all on tape the fake poles the fake everything the fake you know they\\'re called suppression poles they\\'re meant to make you depressed are you depressed you don\\'t look depressed [Applause] the real numbers are we have the real numbers we\\'re leading everywhere we are leading everywhere i\\'ll tell you i think [Applause] i think we\\'re way ahead of what we were four years ago and there\\'s far more enthusiasm our base is bigger it\\'s stronger and we\\'ve done the greatest job again if we didn\\'t get hit by the plague from china this thing we wouldn\\'t have even between us i would have canceled mr congressman most of the rallies i wouldn\\'t have needed a rally that\\'s a little bit unfair but that\\'s okay that\\'s what china has done to our nation they\\'ve screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways never has anybody ripped off our nation like china and i\\'ve taken in billions and billions of dollars we never we never took in 10 cents from china and i gave 28 billion right 28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by china and our farmers are very unhappy i don\\'t think we have too many farmers in this wonderful pennsylvania town i know we have a lot of boilermakers over there we got a lot of boilermakers i\\'ll be talking about them look at those guys nobody going to mess with them i\\'ll tell you we\\'re going to be talking about them in a minute but for the entire summer biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement and democrat-run cities all burned down businesses terrorized civilians and just recently marched through the streets chanting death to america this is what we have death to america and by the way we could end it like immediately you saw what we did in wisconsin it ended took a while for the governor you know they have to ask us in it\\'s like otherwise uh we have to do something much bigger and it\\'s totally unnecessary the national guard is fantastic i went to see him two days ago biden went there today there was nobody there there was nobody there he was a little late i was going to say hey listen we ended that problem but we could end it in portland wise guys in portland anarchists they\\'re agitators they\\'re looters i\\'ll tell you we could end it in portland in a half an hour we did it in seattle we told them we\\'re coming in you either ended or were coming in congressman we were going in the next day we\\'re all set i was actually disappointed to be honest they ended it in seattle they took over 20 of the city do you believe this and the mayor said no it\\'s going to be a summer of love these people are crazy so we we end them very quickly we end them very quickly and now what we\\'re doing is we\\'re holding back funds for cities that don\\'t know what they\\'re doing where they allow crime to run rampant and we put a 10-year prison sentence on anybody that knocks down a statue i took out an old ordinance a very old one because today in congress you don\\'t get things like that today they think that you should just uh have no cash bail you know they do the no cash bail you kill somebody there\\'s no bail don\\'t worry about it go out but i took out an old ordinance i gave a new executive order it says 10 years in prison and amazingly [Music] amazingly that was like three and a half months ago and they were having a big march on washington march elsewhere and amazingly that was the end of the statues coming down no statues and we\\'re actually prosecuting people for having done it we made it retroactive to the beginning terrible and by the way the state statutes and monuments they have to do the same thing it\\'s real easy but the rioters that want biden to win they want him to win because their agenda isn\\'t a agenda it\\'s what they want it\\'s the craziest thing i\\'ve ever seen they both want to cut funding for police they want to end that cash bail they want to hire far left prosecutors and judges and let the criminals run wild the radical left district attorney in portland mike schmidt his name is has released hundreds of rioters and announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers disorderly conduct criminal trespass rioting and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance oh it\\'s worse it\\'s worse you have somebody in philadelphia who\\'s worse right worse in his manifesto with bernie sanders that\\'s what it is biden agreed to all these things you know you notice now no no i never said about frackie and i never said if you don\\'t do fracking in pennsylvania 900 000 jobs and your energy bills will triple other than that i don\\'t think you should have it okay no but he said in the manifesto plus he said many times you know we put on the clip yesterday worry no fracking know this know that i mean no guns how about guns no guns no second amendment biden has pledged to appoint prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide that\\'s what he\\'s done that\\'s called the manifesto he agreed to all this stuff the craziest thing you know you\\'re supposed to bring it to the right he actually brought it further left bernie never dreamt that this was possible crazy bernie you know crazy bernie you know i had a lot of his voters came to come to me four years ago a big percentage you know why because i agree with him and he agrees with with me on one thing trade the trade because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did i nobody else got it especially biden never got it he never got it still doesn\\'t get it now he really gets nothing i\\'ll tell you he didn\\'t get it in prime time now he really doesn\\'t get it [Applause] but it\\'s okay for them to make every city look just like portland which is a disaster and again we could clean it up we just go right through it five thousand tenth out right through it these guys are tough they\\'re smart and they love our country they love our country we\\'ll clean it up in one half hour it\\'ll be over did you see this radical left mayor wheeler his name is the radical left mayor they chased him mike they chased him out of his home last night and all he does is be nice to them because they don\\'t understand nice they only understand one thing strength that\\'s the only thing they under they don\\'t understand nice they chased him out of his home unbelievable biden\\'s plan is to appease the domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them and i will always defend law-abiding citizens that\\'s why the rioters are voting for biden and the law enforcement people you know we have it from everybody we just got the sheriffs in florida all of them all of them we got ohio we got texas we got north carolina we got south carolina we got everybody i don\\'t know if there\\'s anybody and i see rick perry right there rick perry what are you doing here rick rick perry one of the greats [Applause] but they\\'re all voting for me this election is about safety and this election is about jobs today i\\'m delighted to accept a very very special endorsement from people i like sort of grew up with these people i don\\'t know what it is the relationship we have with all of us with all of us but i\\'m endorsing i\\'m getting an endorsement tonight from some very very uh special people they work hard they do great we really put them back to work because this state was in trouble and last year you had the single greatest year economic year in the history of your whole operation right of your whole operation you\\'ve never had anything like that this has been your greatest this has been prior to the plague coming in it\\'s been the commonwealth\\'s greatest can we ever call the commonwealth of state you have two places you always have to say well wait a minute is this one a commonwealth two places you know what the other place is name it huh that\\'s right how did you know that congressman but this commonwealth it\\'s a great commonwealth it\\'s a great place and the boilermakers local union local 154 of the boilermakers they chartered in pittsburgh 125 years ago none of you are around to see it and it now represents members in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia and i want to thank john hughes and the boilermakers here today it\\'s a great honor to have you let me who\\'s john where the hell is john stand up john [Music] john we appreciate it we appreciate it do you know why john is the head you know why because look he\\'s got the worst location i say where\\'s john i\\'m looking in the front row he said put up your hand john look at that guy he\\'s good you\\'ve got my vote john hey boilermakers thank you what a job you do you\\'re the heart of this country you really are thank you very much that\\'s a great endorsement that\\'s a great endorsement [Applause] joe biden spent the last 47 years shipping pennsylvania jobs to china and foreign nations and i\\'ve spent the last four years bringing them back home and we\\'re bringing them back home bringing a lot of things back i in the last administration\\'s eight-year pure war on pennsylvania oil and coal and fracking and national if you look at the natural gas what they\\'ve done to this state what they were doing to this state it was sort of easy i just opened it up and i said do it and the investment put into pennsylvania the investment put into the commonwealth of pennsylvania has been record-setting but again you had the greatest year you\\'ve ever had last year prior to the virus you\\'re going to be set now with what we\\'re doing i believe that this next quarter which will be announced interestingly just prior to the election so i\\'m putting myself on the line but i know what\\'s going to happen the numbers are going to be great and next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for pennsylvania but for the entire country so joe hyden we have a new one joe hayden we call him joe hayden i have all of them what do you like better what do you like better we got a number let\\'s do a little poll can we do a poll i saved myself so much money you know i saved myself so much money we do these polls with thousands and those people are coming in from the back are they not yes they\\'re coming in i\\'m telling you wouldn\\'t have believed it i\\'m landing i wasn\\'t waving at you i was waving at them there\\'s more but i do these polls right and it\\'s like a perfect poll you know do you ever see the companies you give them a million bucks and they do a poll like 78 people were polled no you got thousands of people so tell me what\\'s your feeling first of all in the name what\\'s it you like magga make america great again yes huh oh you are the one you are a man i made you famous today you said the nicest things about me thank you did you see him on television today i think you\\'re great i think you\\'re great thank you now he called me a great christian and a great christian leader thank you but he did say i wasn\\'t perfect but that\\'s okay i said thank you anyway right no that was really great that was really great but if you look at it the things they\\'ve done we\\'re going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because i love the people saying do this or do that but one of the things i got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it\\'s so bad it\\'s a rip-off of our country the so-called paris climate accord it\\'s a disaster a death sentence it\\'s a death sentence for your energy jobs i took it out i withdrew from that calamity biden pledged to reinstate it it\\'s going to cost you billions and billions of dollars you know what it really is it\\'s a way of really taking advantage of the united states that\\'s what it is last year i visited the shell petrochemical plant in beaver county anybody ever hear of beaver county the largest investment in your state\\'s history all made possible by our pro-energy policies biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600 000 pennsylvania workers it\\'s probably 940 000 they say think of that also prices and everything else now biden today came out and said no no fracking\\'s okay it\\'s okay did you just say that fracking\\'s okay because he was getting killed and now he came out in favor of law enforcement look at all these handsome cops here and a beautiful cop [Applause] no but how can anybody believe it he\\'s totally against at his speech and at the dnc where we got much higher numbers than they did but you know they put out that they did they\\'ll say anything we got much higher by millions and millions of people we had a great did we have a great convention [Applause] good job you did but we had a great convention and it\\'s been uh really terrific you know i made a speech at mount rushmore and since that speech our numbers have been up up up like a rocket like a beautiful rocket the mount rushmore speech i said you know we\\'re getting hit by this pandemic very unfairly in the sense that we\\'ve done such a good job with the ventilators all of the things you know you\\'ve heard it a thousand times and we have to get back and i made a speech in really a great place south dakota but it was mount rushmore you know they want to blow it up you know they want to take off now right if you would see how beautiful if you would see how beautiful this is it was like this perfect evening the sun was setting the faces of these great great majestic heroes of our country right heroes of our country [Applause] and they want to blow up mount rushmore but how about this one the democrats yesterday came out with a plan did you see it now they\\'re the d.c democrats they want to change the name of the washington monument perhaps take it down [Applause] thomas jefferson pretty good thomas jefferson right you could forget about ever hearing that name again abraham lincoln you could forget about it they want to take down all statues all monuments in washington we have some of your greatest people right here let me not even talk to the congressman the heck with the congressman the boilermakers how do you like how do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great george washington thomas jefferson abraham lincoln andrew jackson all of them i don\\'t think the boilermakers you\\'ll ring you\\'ll do a ring around washington right along with christopher columbus he\\'s in big trouble i\\'ll tell you except there was one there was a group of great italians in new york they tried to take down [Applause] they tried to take down christopher columbus statue in new york you saw what happened right these italians formed a little circle they say come on the agitators decided to leave let\\'s get out of here darling they protected christopher columbus the italians no the italians aren\\'t big on taking down christopher columbus you take down those statues you can forget about the italian vote do we agree but they protected it when asked in a debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking and natural gas and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work and they produce you know just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country biden said no we would absolutely not allow anything like that we would make sure it\\'s totally eliminated that\\'s what he said he said we would make sure it\\'s totally eliminated or eliminated now he\\'s coming and saying this isn\\'t working too well this isn\\'t working you know i made a speech a week ago in texas we had crowds that were unbelievable on the highways it you can\\'t get in but the highways it\\'s like incredible you could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money go to ebay even as a used ticket you could probably sell but you go down the highways and you see and i was thinking in texas i\\'m making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil they like god and you know what i\\'ll say like they like their second amendment right so so think about it so whether it\\'s pennsylvania or texas or oklahoma or north dakota or any any place you take a look at this right and no oil no guns no god i don\\'t think george washington running with abraham lincoln as his vp he\\'ll pick abraham lincoln as vp is going to win in texas or in pennsylvania or anyplace else with those three things eliminated that\\'s what they want to do they want to take away your second amendment if i weren\\'t president you would either have an obliterated second amendment or it would be gone entirely i am standing between them and your second amendment and that\\'s it that\\'s it they know he put vado in charge of guns beto is in charge he wants to get rid of everything beto that\\'s a beauty remember he said i was born for this anybody that says they\\'re born for this remember better he was on the cover of a magazine i won\\'t mention the magazine they\\'re back there it\\'s a total phony magazine but he was on the cover of the magazine and he said i was born to run for presta he was born for it i was born anybody that gets that carried away that was when he was doing well since then he\\'s cratered ever since he made that statement he\\'s looked very bad but he\\'s uh take a look at what he says about guns and he got put in charge of guns so i guess biden pretty soon is going to be coming out saying no no i never said that check out all of the statement he\\'s made on everything and now he\\'s going the opposite way but he\\'s agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he\\'ll do that and then he figures later on he\\'ll go but everything he said is right because he has no control over what\\'s happening the radical left has captured the party they even elected a person that nobody ever heard of a senator it\\'s been a while against a young good-looking kennedy by 10 points in massachusetts did you know kennedy lost in massachusetts you know why because he wasn\\'t a radical left he was like a semi-normal person just slightly left no but think of it this is what\\'s happened and this is really what\\'s happened if you\\'re not a radical lefty meaning guns meaning fossil fuels they want wind wind you know to make the windmill which are made mostly in china and in germany by the way to make it so much emission is let out that it\\'s more than you can ever save it\\'s just the craziest thing also i\\'m a big i am truly an environmentalist but you have to understand when we do things and they don\\'t and we clean and it\\'s very expensive to do that and they don\\'t and we have this massive planet and china india russia germany all these places it\\'s fuming up and we\\'re doing our job and beautiful no they have to do it also otherwise it just doesn\\'t work the way it\\'s supposed to [Applause] they want to ban straws has anybody ever tried those paper straws they\\'re not working right they want to ban straws i said well you know i\\'ve had a couple of meals at mcdonald\\'s etc over the years right wendy\\'s friend of mine owns wendy\\'s i\\'ll give it a plug right burger king so they want to ban straws i said oh really what about the carton what about the plate what about the knives and the spoons that are plastic oh they\\'re okay but the straws we gotta ban has anybody ever tried seriously the new sort\\'s made out of paper right it disintegrates as you\\'re drinking if you have a nice tie like this tie this would have no chance by the time you get finished the straw is totally disintegrated does anybody walk around with a plastic straw because it\\'s not bad you know you whip it out boom boom you never had to do that when asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda you know what the answer is right it\\'s the green new deal right the screening this was made by this was made up this was made up by people that don\\'t get it either that or people that just don\\'t like our country very much but biden replied yes he\\'ll get rid of those jobs and he famously told a voter i want you to look in my eyes when he\\'s not wearing the mask because i\\'ve never seen a man that liked the mask look i\\'m all for it we have a big weekend distance on the weekend and all of that stuff and wear your mask when you close together in particular and wash your hands all those things we have labor day weekend coming up but did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him and then he makes a speech and he always has it not always but a lot of times he has it hanging down because you know what it gives him a feeling of security if i were a psychiatrist right no i\\'d say i\\'d say this guy\\'s got some big issues hang in there congressman give me your mask i want to have it hanging from my i don\\'t want to touch your damn mask mike i\\'ll never touch your man [Applause] no but the new one is you know i went for a physical the doctor said to me sir would you like to go over to walter reed it\\'s incredible by the way the job they do on people that have been just really hurt are heroes and the job they do is incredible but sir would you like to go over and do a physical you have some time you know why i had time some deal oh it was china i decided not to see china because they didn\\'t like the way they were doing business okay does that make sense so the doctor white house doctor highly respected sean sean connelly sir would you like to go over and do your physical do a piece of it or finish it or whatever it was but do a physic i said i don\\'t know i\\'m not in love with the idea well let\\'s if you do it we don\\'t have to do it okay let\\'s go come on so we went way one and we\\'re driving now you have to understand there are like you know 100 cars you see what happens here it\\'s like the plane times 50. so the cars are driving all over it\\'s about a 20-minute drive and we get to the hospital i get out i was there probably for an hour and a half two hours and then yesterday i read that i had strokes cnn fake news cnn right there now it\\'s mini strokes i called them i don\\'t know what a mini stroke is but it\\'s not good and there could be a day and donald admit i said hey it happens to all of us right except these young ones it\\'s never going to happen to them they\\'re not looking at that but you know what happens but nothing happens so i went in i did that part of the physical the end result was he\\'s very healthy they\\'re very unhappy when they heard that result and what you don\\'t remember is when this took place it was a long time ago they just started up because we wanna they wanna try and get me to be in biden\\'s physical level you know they viewed me as being somebody that\\'s you know i go around hey last week this week texas north carolina florida south carolina back to washington let\\'s go here let\\'s go there let\\'s go everywhere meetings all the time i think i\\'ve answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history and mean question you know i watched biden yesterday so he hasn\\'t answered questions in what two months or something and yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like i\\'ve never seen one young woman who i think is there one young woman is smiling hi hi i just like to ask you i\\'m sorry to bother you with this question it\\'s the most incredible so the doctor wrote a letter saying no this uh rumor is wrong and i don\\'t like you know rumors like that and by the way if it were a fact it\\'s fine it should i think it\\'s an important thing but if it\\'s not true my wife was like she came to me she said i think i would have known that i said yeah i think they would have known her too because they drove back with me you know the press follows me they have a special deal of van they followed me and then we go in we go out but if you remember last time i go in i spend a little time a physical like we all have hopefully you have a good thing to have i guess as long as they give you a good answer if they give you a bad answer don\\'t bother possibly too late but i go in i come out a couple of hours later i guess whatever it is short time later i get into the car the press sees me get into the car on my way home i get a call from my wife the first lady who\\'s very popular do we like our first she\\'s very popular great person great woman she said darling are you okay i go why do you ask she said they\\'re reporting that you had a heart attack now you have to understand i\\'m driving in a car which is about what six cars in front of the press because they have a big car a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible make it uncomfortable but they\\'re right behind me so they know i got in and cnn reported that i had a heart attack that was the same visit and that didn\\'t work [Music] you know it\\'s unbelievable cnn reported i had a heart attack so my wife was concerned i said no not that i know of and if i did i think i\\'d be back there no i\\'m i\\'ll be home in 15 minutes darling thank you for caring it\\'s always nice it\\'s always she sounded relieved that\\'s good when your wife sounds relieved but she said i wonder how that happened why did they do that because they\\'re fake news so i go in and that rumor lasted for a little while like a day or two it lasted for a little while no matter what i did you know i walk i\\'m in the same motorcade i go in and i go out they know i\\'m in the motorcade i actually have to report it but i\\'m in the motorcade and they said i had to cut one of them said it was a massive heart attack think of it again it could happen someday okay and when it does i hope things work out but they knew i\\'m in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they\\'re fake news now for the same visit that was the same you know that was the stupidest thing from now on when i go for a physical or something or go to the hospital announce it because this was a quick thing the doctor he got me in a lot of trouble he\\'s a great doctor i said no more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time but so now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the new york times who\\'s a third great reporter writes a book and he said the vice president was prepared to take over the reigns because they thought the president was going to go i guess under anesthesia do they still call it in the old days they called it anesthesia it\\'s essentially the same thing i don\\'t want to get into a situation like where biden use record player remember that you go home you turn on your record player but the anesthesia and i said how could that be so remember just the same visit same visit they said heart attack a long time all of a sudden out of this book and he said suffered mini strokes now they get a letter from the white house doctor that said it\\'s totally false totally false but they still go with it they go with it and they know i\\'m in the group with them coming back and if you i don\\'t know much about a mini stroke but i assume mr congressman if you have a mini stroke you\\'re not heading back to the white house right at least you\\'ll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital right so anyway these are really dangerous people they are so bad for our country if we had honest press it would be so great for the usa he\\'s so great they\\'re just a bunch of phony people not all of them you have some very good ones like about ten percent no you have some very good ones you have some great journalists but it\\'s really they know it\\'s phony stuff they\\'re doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the white house and i just don\\'t think the public is going to fall for it [Applause] i don\\'t think the public is going to fall for it you know in his best days 25 30 years ago he was weak he was weak as a senator he was weak he was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it\\'s not exactly prime time i can tell you that i just want to announce tonight because we\\'re joined with some very very special warriors and dan muser dan thank you very much great job you\\'re doing dan congressman these are congressmen who have uh really been warriors for me i really have been thank you very much dan fred keller fred thank you great job brett the great john joyce great thank you john guy reschenthaler do you know digression [Applause] what are you doing over there what happened you don\\'t get along with these guys huh oh okay that\\'s good now i understand that\\'s good glenn thompson great job great job brent really great and a real good friend of mine right from the beginning right mike you know we were in pennsylvania and a friend of ours a congressman long term right from kentucky no from actually tennessee came up to us i was getting ready to make a speech and tennessee is very early voting remember what he said this was four years ago he said i don\\'t know what\\'s happening in pennsylvania i don\\'t know what\\'s happening in the rest of the country but if what\\'s going on in the rest of the country is like what\\'s going on in tennessee he said they\\'re coming from the hills the roadsides the rivers he said they\\'re coming people that never really cared to vote they\\'re great americans but they never wanted to vote for the people that they would see he said they\\'re miles long they\\'ve got trump here trump hats trump pins right tennessee duncan congressman duncan right remember that mike that was the first time i mean they said they\\'ve never seen anything like it tennessee has been incredible by the way but so mike and i listened and we said i wonder what that\\'s all about but it is true people that weren\\'t really political people they\\'re coming in and you know the deal here like the miss universe good old miss universe right like this uh they came with hats they came with pins they\\'re loaded with pins one person had hundreds of pins they never had a pin in their life but they love the job that we\\'ve done and we\\'re going to do it even better in the next four years another great friend of mine who\\'s a tough cookie and a great congressman but he unfortunately he\\'s a former uh because he\\'s just uh i don\\'t know he\\'s just a special guy and really has a big beautiful heart lou barletta lou thank you you look good luke why don\\'t you run again and a man who\\'s tough you know there\\'s this guy you ever hear of a guy named conor lamb he\\'s like a lamb so we heard you know because he\\'s in sort of a trumpy area right and we heard that he\\'s going to be for trump but he\\'s going to be fighting for trump and you know i sort of i saw some of his commercials i thought he was a

are we doing in texas [Applause] huh we had a poll today in georgia you know they say george is going to be close well this was a poll that hates trump and warp seven that was the same thing happened last time right you know they used the words in play george is in play they say george is in play well we\\'re up seven and this is a poll that truly hates us okay but they did the last time didn\\'t they say last time that texas was in play and then it was eight o\\'clock the polls closed and they only announce of your way ahead so they say the polls have closed in the great state of texas donald trump has won the great state of texas and i kept hearing it was in play they said utah the home of our worst senator they said utah was in play that\\'s mitt romney mike lee is doing excellent i didn\\'t want to get them confused by them but they say utah same thing remember that four years ago we hit the guy with the shaved head what was his name rick what what a what a loser that was you know that\\'s right a mcmuffin i think something and he was going to win utah and i wanted by many many many points it was called immediately so these are people that are just not good in fact hillary even beat this guy hillary hillary came in second in utah in less than four years we\\'ve achieved more than anyone thought possible we passed massive tax cuts for hard-working families and we eliminated more regulations than any administration in the history of our country i saved the u.s auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration\\'s job-killing catastrophe known as the trans-pacific partnership it would have been a catastrophe not only for autos by the way for everything else too to protect our workers i impose stiff tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel that kept you guys very busy they were dumping all over the place is that right they were dumping and it was bad steel too it was dirt steel this week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from brazil and from mexico for the rest of the year despite the usmca sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them so we stopped that we\\'re reversing decades of the biden betrayals that decimated pennsylvania jobs you know that this state lost listen to this one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china\\'s entrance into the world trade organization one of the worst things that happened when china came in you know they were flatlined for many years then they came into this crazy deal they\\'re considered a developing nation you see i\\'ve been sort of protesting that like but they\\'re considering china as a developing nation you get all sorts of things that you would never get advantages over the united states well we have very strongly protested that they\\'re not a developing nation they\\'re a very powerful developed nation and you know what they got to pay what everyone else has to pay earlier this year i kept my promise to the commonwealth of pennsylvania when we ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new u.s mexico canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well everyone said it\\'ll never happen and i had great help from these gentlemen right here i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china\\'s pillaging plundering and rampant theft of pennsylvania and many other places jobs that\\'s all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by china and others joe biden\\'s agenda is made in china my agenda is made in america [Applause] after years and years of rebuilding other countries we are finally rebuilding our country it\\'s called america first we\\'re america first that\\'s enough and we\\'re bringing our soldiers back home you see what\\'s going on after 19 years in afghanistan [Applause] far away places to bring hope to our inner cities i created opportunity zones tim scott great senator from south carolina worked on it with me past criminal justice reform delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that obama would never do and before the china virus we achieved the lowest african-american hispanic-american asian-american unemployment rates ever recorded by far and they\\'re now heading back in that direction quickly democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades they failed the asian community the hispanic community they failed women the numbers on women\\'s unemployment were the best in 61 years biden spent the last 47 years betraying the american people he was always for things that you wouldn\\'t want and now he\\'s changing no i never said that i never said that i\\'ve spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the african-american community and for all communities and the best is yet to come [Applause] perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly portrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration you know we\\'ve been fighting for that under my administration we achieved the most secure border in american history we ended catch and release stop the asylum form and we\\'ve deported 20 000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out there thank you ice ice and border patrol ice and border patrol they don\\'t like ice because ice is they\\'re tough you got to be tough in that job by the way anybody up here like to work in ice i don\\'t think so let\\'s see who could you could probably be okay but you\\'d rather do what you\\'re doing right i agree with you these are tough guys they have to be tough these are bad bad gang members i mean you look at ms-13 you look at what\\'s happened with ms-13 you look at but we get them the hell out sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don\\'t even want to take a chance it can come back in after what they\\'ve done we built 300 miles of border wall and we\\'re adding 10 new miles every single work every week and the wall will be finished very soon and by the way they keep saying but mexico will be paying for the wall and i say it respectfully to mexico but they will be paying for the wall they understand that they just don\\'t want to ride it and that\\'s okay too because mexico\\'s treated us very well the president of mexico right now they have 27 000 mexican soldiers on our border guarding us from people coming in illegally [Music] we invested 2.5 trillion dollars in the united states military and launched the first new branch of the united states armed forces in nearly 75 years since the air force and that\\'s called the space force right sean pretty good going to send mike into space you want to go into space but our great congressman but think of that you know we created a new branch of the united states that alone if you had that that alone but then you add judges all the other things we pass va choice and va accountability so now instead of waiting for a week two weeks five weeks nine weeks to see a doctor you don\\'t have a doctor you go right out you get a private doctor we pay the bill and our great veterans get better quickly and accountability we keep people accountable for the way they treat our veterans and if they don\\'t treat them well we say sorry you\\'re fired get out no we couldn\\'t fire anybody we had sadists we had thieves we had some very bad people in the va and they\\'re all gone thank you i love you too thank you thank you such friendly voices right beautiful only in pennsylvania right thank you i withdrew from the last administration\\'s disastrous iran nuclear deal think of this obama paid 150 billion for a short-term deal he gave 1.8 billion in cash you ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in 100 bills it\\'s a lot it\\'s like the size of this right now think 1.8 billion how did you guys allow that to happen they said we all voted against it i kept my promise recognized the true capital of israel [Applause] you never know nowadays right and i opened the u.s embassy in jerusalem i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights they\\'ve been trying to get that done for 52 years i got it done immediately and by the way as far as the capital of israel jerusalem they\\'ve been talking about many many presidents they all promised it nobody did it i did it we get things done and we just did something that is incredible even the new york times gave it good reviews like not good reviews beyond good reviews tom friedman gave it phenomenal reviews you believe that and that\\'s we achieved the first breakthrough in middle east peace in decades a deal with israel right and the uae to deal with israel in the uae and that\\'s going to lead and i will tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we we want to get in that day you\\'ll have peace in the middle east but we want to get the hell out let\\'s get them all back let\\'s get them all back don\\'t forget we\\'re energy independent there used to be a reason now we do have a resource called israel but and we have some very good partnerships over there in all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we\\'re going to take care of those countries but we are energy independent for the first time and that\\'s a very good feeling and our military has never been stronger than it is now it\\'s new and it\\'s beautiful and i told you we took over 100 of the isis caliphate in iraq and syria and we killed the founder and leader of isis al-baghdadi [Applause] and separately we killed the world\\'s number one terrorist number one terrorist for decades and decades kasim solomoni is a big step for the middle east we kept america out of wars remember they always said oh this trump he\\'s radical he\\'s really i mean he\\'s off to he\\'s too radical he\\'ll get us in wars i kept you out of wars what happened with north korea look i get along with kim jong-un they say that\\'s terrible he gets along no it\\'s good if i get along if i get along with russia is that a good thing or a bad thing i think it\\'s a good thing these maniacs anytime they always talk about russia they never talk about china you know it\\'s very interesting it\\'s always russia i heard it starting again they said somebody spoke to russia two years ago russia russia russia this total maniac shifty shift he\\'s a total maniac so now it\\'s always do you ever notice i can\\'t even listen but when i hear russia i just turn it off it\\'s crazy but you know getting along with countries is actually a good thing can we explain that it\\'s a good thing not a bad thing it\\'s a very good thing but remember i was the one that was going to be leading you into war in the first week he\\'ll be in war he\\'s a radical kind of a personality i\\'m really not i like that piece but if we ever do get into war we will knock the hell out of them [Music] these guys only fight to tie they don\\'t fight to win we fight to win but you look at what\\'s happening where they\\'re all coming back home i even reduced in germany because germany they\\'re an ally but you know they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military so we removed a lot of soldiers out of germany they\\'re not happy they said this is going to hurt our economy well it\\'s good for our economy okay they thought it was going to hurt the german economy well they don\\'t treat us right they don\\'t pay their bills they\\'re delinquent you know what delinquent is they delinquent they don\\'t pay their bills we protect them they don\\'t pay their bills we got to do something and they and they treat us horribly on trade through the european union which basically they run together we\\'ve been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and biden was there for every one of them joe biden supported nafta china\\'s entry into the world trade he supported the korean deal the korean deal was so bad it was so bad this was a deal that was going to produce south korea done by crooked hillary clinton this was a deal that was going to produce 250 000 jobs she said this will be 250 000 and she was right for south korea produced 250 for us we got nothing we got no we got losses we got nothing it was a terrible deal i renegotiated now it\\'s a good deal and they also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens biden supported cutting social security he voted for the iraq war he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden he opposed the killing of solomonia when i did that he said that\\'s a terrible thing that\\'s a terrible thing everybody in the middle east they couldn\\'t believe it they celebrated some of them quite quietly i must have he oversaw the rise of isis and he cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and the entire world remember that now he\\'s trying to say well i could be tough in china too no he can\\'t china owns him china owns sleepy joe he\\'s not going to be tough in china and he said all these wonderful things and then all of a sudden his poll numbers started going down how about law enforcement he\\'s like so bad in his entire convention they didn\\'t even mention and by the way something else they did that i think is terrible really terrible the words under god right right right called the pledge of allegiance under god he left those two words out twice at their caucus which is part of their convention but that\\'s where they\\'re coming from he\\'s trying to say oh well we didn\\'t do this and then we gave it to him and he sort of shut up but then two days later he\\'s saying it didn\\'t happen they lie and these mail-in ballots these mail-in ballots are a disgrace and they know it [Applause] sign your mail-in ballot okay you sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on election day or early voting that is not tabulated and counted you go vote and then if for some reason after that it shouldn\\'t take that long it comes in they\\'re not going to be able to tabulate it because you will have voted but you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they\\'re going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff i\\'m trying to be nice i\\'m trying to be nice they want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots now there have been many races over the last year where they\\'ve done this and they\\'ve been a disaster you look at new york they had a con congressional race not a very good congresswoman very untalented i know her well i lived in new york she\\'s not got much going they have no idea what the vote is i think 20 percent of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said what about me he\\'s not too happy her opponent you look at what happened in paterson new jersey you look at what happened in virginia you look at what happened there\\'s not a race and these are small these are easy to control now they want to send out 80 million unsolicited i like it much better they used to say universal they used to say live ballots i like the word unsolicited and solicited so listen it\\'s okay because that\\'s when you\\'re asking and you want it then you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out that\\'s okay but you can\\'t this whole thing with the unsolicited unsolicited means you\\'re sitting there you know we have a big enthusiasm edge but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten balanced they have dogs have gotten balanced and they know i\\'m right and everybody knows them right and they say i\\'m right behind the closed doors and it\\'s a disgrace what they do to our country 80 million unsolicited ballots people that had no idea people that weren\\'t going to vote in all fairness it\\'s really unfair because our people have enthusiasm they\\'re going out to vote they\\'re all going out to vote everybody here going to vote everybody but they have no enthusiasm i said so that\\'s unfair that guy walks and then i\\'ll have somebody knock on the door say listen we\\'d like your ballot i don\\'t want to vote i don\\'t care about i\\'m a democrat i don\\'t care about this guy well look where is it here take it blah blah blah they even have a provision where you don\\'t have to verify signatures what is going on and they have another provision in some states where you can harvest that\\'s where you grab them all together and drop them and in nevada they actually have a provision where they don\\'t have to be counted till seven days after the election so that means if we have a close election could be close i hope it\\'s not i hope we have a landslide like you\\'ve never seen but if we have a close election that means nevada has the right to and i love nevada i think we\\'re going to win nevada except where they\\'re sending all these hundreds of thousands millions of unsolicited ballots to people in nevada and people that probably left a long time ago it\\'s very unfair it\\'s a very unfair but think of it they have seven days after the election did you know that mike seven days what does that mean i want to see the results of the election on november 3rd right and by the way if it\\'s anything like these other events it could go on forever i mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done they should make that do a do-over and i think in patterson they have a do-over i think they\\'re going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud theft people were selling ballots people were selling ballots and you know they talk about russia they\\'re so worried about russia what about sending out 80 million ballots that\\'s your real problem and you know if russia or china or these other countries want to cheat all they have to do is forge ballots it\\'s much easier than the way they have to go about it right so we have to put pressure on these people now the good news is we have a lot of court cases we have one in pennsylvania you know that right and we have two judges we have a state judge we have a federal judge i think both highly qualified judges from what i understand i hear that they\\'re not too happy about what they\\'re seeing so we\\'ll see what happens we\\'re going to see what happens the lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted and if it\\'s not counted vote and then they have the job if it comes in late and if it\\'s not too late they have the job of making sure that they don\\'t count it but follow that ballot because these people they\\'ll be lost they\\'ll be gone the numbers are incredible where they\\'re 25 and 30 percent off 20 off follow your ballot when i banned travel from china biden called it hysterical and xenophobic if we had listened to sleepy joe hundreds of thousands of more americans would have died you know that you know he\\'s always he always gets up today covert 19 covent i said joe look we got a country and i agree with that and we\\'ve done a hell of a job we\\'ve done a hell of a job if you look at some of our numbers but you got to start talking about the economy and you got to start talking your your place i mean this is a when you look at pennsylvania you\\'re in a shutdown you have a governor that has you shut down that\\'s right i didn\\'t even think i didn\\'t even think about it you have a governor that has you shut down that\\'s right and almost all states are open and frankly their numbers are very good you look at florida\\'s now way down arizona which had a spike way down california texas is going way down they\\'re all way down you haven\\'t even opened up you haven\\'t even opened up the great commonwealth well you have the same thing in north carolina and you have the same thing in michigan what she\\'s doing to michigan has said and you know you have death with a shutdown you have depression you have drugs and alcohol you have sickness you have loss of jobs and people you have suicides don\\'t even think about it but you have suicides you have a tremendous there\\'s actually at this stage we did the right thing we closed the country down we studied it we learned about it we know the susceptible are old people senior citizens nursing homes people that are old especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes we know that we learned it and we opened it up but the problem the shutdowns are causing much bigger problems you remember my original statement right the cure can\\'t be greater you know it was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it\\'s so true you have to open up this commonwealth it has to be opened up it has to be opened up now but here\\'s what i think they\\'re doing because you have the same thing in new york we have a governor in new york who\\'s 36 000 people died 11 000 people in nursing because he made a mistake he made a horrible mistake and i built him a convention center with 2 800 beds that they didn\\'t use it and i sent up a ship a great hospital ship a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn\\'t use it and he requested it and then i said you\\'re not using it why aren\\'t you using it he could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship what a shame but you look at new york the restaurants are all closed it\\'s so sad for me i love new york you know i grew up in new york i love new york i did well in new york and it\\'s so sad when i look at what\\'s happening with new york it\\'s all politics if you kill somebody they don\\'t prosecute you but they go after political enemies it\\'s a terrible what\\'s happening in new york is a terrible thing and the place is dead no restaurants a restaurant poor guys you can\\'t how long can you do this for the people are going to lose their jobs they\\'re never going to open again it\\'s not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world it\\'s a hard business new york is closed you\\'re closed north carolina\\'s close michigan\\'s all democrats and let me tell you what\\'s going to happen on november 4th they\\'re going to announce their opening they\\'re doing this for political reasons right sean they\\'re doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible going into november third election day and then as soon as the election\\'s over we\\'ll lose a draw for them they\\'re gonna they\\'re gonna open it they got nothing and you know what it\\'s a shame what they\\'re doing for political reasons they\\'ll be open you\\'ll be open on november 4th but you know what from your standpoint it\\'s very close for the election it\\'s very far if you have a restaurant then you can\\'t open your restaurant you can\\'t open your store it\\'s a disgrace and they ought to get together they ought to do it these are democrat governors in all instances and democrat mayor when the china virus arrived we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii thanks to the life-saving therapies that we\\'ve pioneered the mortality rate has been reduced by 85 since april think of that and we\\'ve achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world you never hear that from the fake news they don\\'t want to talk to you about it and this is a big country this is a tougher country to do that with the european union\\'s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours and if you look now spain is having a big blow up france is having a big blow up no we\\'ve done a great job we haven\\'t been given credit for it and he always starts off covert 19 that\\'s all he knows covert 19. i said what about the economy what about jobs what about all the other things we have to do all he does he thinks it\\'s a weak spot and actually in theory if we\\'re getting a fair shake from those people back there it\\'s actually what the job we\\'ve done is actually a strong spot and that includes you people with the ventilators that nobody had nobody that needed a ventilator didn\\'t get eventually now we\\'re supplying them all over the world all together the nations of europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the united states think of that you don\\'t hear these numbers cases in the u.s have declined by 28 percent nationwide over the last month and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials would have taken two years for another president i was going to say a normal president but they\\'ll hit me with a little truth to that too no but for another president especially you know the last administration they had the h1n1 pandemic it was called swine flu you know joe always calls it the n1h1 he gets it mixed up no it\\'s the h1n1 joe not that it matters i guess no do you ever notice he\\'s always calling it the other he calls it the opposite he has no clue where he is but he keeps saying oh if he was well he didn\\'t want to ban china and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning china i was the only one that wanted to do it actually and then we banned europe because i saw what was happening in italy and spain and france and we banned europe we saved hundreds of thousands and if i didn\\'t do the closing and the opening so we\\'re at 175 000. far too look one is too much because this was given to us by china and it\\'s a disgrace it\\'s a disgrace they could have stopped it they stopped it from going into china but not going to the rest of the world including our country it\\'s a disgrace but think of it joe biden got the worst marks you\\'ve ever seen for his handling of the h1n1 swine flu they said it was incompetent and the head guy who now he\\'s trying to retract it\\'s a little tough that\\'s one great thing about the tape he said it was horrible he said we did a horrible job he said they got lucky it\\'s not contagious like this we got this is a tough one i can look at that guy he\\'ll catch it right there and he\\'s very far away from me it\\'s a tough one because it\\'s so contagious but the swine flu is a different thing but also nothing\\'s easy about that pandemics or epidemics and his marks take a look at the job they did it was so bad that their top person criticized it and they went after him they said don\\'t ever say that again but it\\'s a little late he said it was one of the worst jobs and we actually had a gallup poll where we got very high marks for the job we did and they had a poll where it was so low it wasn\\'t recordable and then he\\'s coming along and telling us how to solve this very difficult problem we\\'ve done a great job and i don\\'t want credit but i want the people mike pence gov i tell you what our vice president mike pence and the task force headed up by mike and working along with a lot of great people they\\'ve done a fantastic job and they just get no credit if i was a democrat a different president and they did the same job they\\'d say it was one of the greatest jobs they\\'ve ever seen but take a look at what they say about the way they handled the swine flu it was a disaster it was incompetent they called themselves incompetent they called them and now they\\'re coming in like well we would have done this and biden by the way was totally against you remember xenophobic racist because i closed down china and then two months later two and a half three and nancy pelosi was having dances in chinatown right a month later no no problem i was way ahead and then biden comes out and he actually said that i was right but they said don\\'t say that try doing it a little softer than that so he did it a little bit softer but we were right they were wrong they handled it so badly just take a look because we i said to my people we\\'ve got to fight this a little bit differently because we\\'re getting a lot of fake news a lot of bad people saying things and you look at the stats and you look at how we\\'ve done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries it\\'s amazing and if you took new york out of it which was a disaster by cuomo if you took new york out of those numbers we would have numbers that would be even better than they are i could read numbers that would be even much better because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because new york was incompetently run by mayor de blasio and governor cuomo and by the way just today there\\'s another incredible thing happening pfizer great company announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks very shortly incredible under operation warp speed we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine in that record time that we talked about this would have been years later it will be delivered before in my opinion before the end of the year but it really might even be delivered before the end of october how do you like that wouldn\\'t that be nice that would be nice and you know why not because of the election be nice because we want to save people that\\'s why be nice that\\'s the important thing together we will defeat the virus the job we\\'re doing is the job that all of the people working on it are generals our admirals the distribution we bought billions and billions of dollars of things and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators very tough the ventilator is very complicated very big very expensive it\\'s like i made the statement it\\'s like building a car but more sophisticated they said no it\\'s not and they said they took a ventilator they took it apart these people are the worst the worst over the next four years we\\'ll make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on china once and for all that\\'s what we\\'re doing and let me just tell you something if they didn\\'t waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment based on a phone call that was perfect this stuff would have all been done it would have all been done it would have all been done and yet with all of the stuff the fake russia witch hunt the fake ukraine how about that did anybody read the transcript of that call it was a perfect call hey congratulations good luck it was like a perfect call now they\\'ll take it back and they\\'ll say well i don\\'t know this was a per in history there\\'s never been anything like this it was a totally lopsided 100 percent political witch hunt and it goes on and on these are bad people i really believe they don\\'t love our country i watch nancy pelosi you must wear your mask you have to wear your mask and we\\'re going to keep every beauty salon closed in california and all over the country and then i see a picture i say nancy pelosi well where\\'s a mess and i\\'ll tell you what she must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly she uses the salon and the salon turned her in the salon turned her in i don\\'t think i would have turned her in i would have said well you know she\\'s a customer i got to take care of my customers right but she made them open and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her how much do they hate nancy pelosi and then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that can\\'t be set up she said i was set up i was set up by the salon owner i was set up i said tell me she didn\\'t say that please so i just put out that if she was set up then she shouldn\\'t be leading the house of representatives i want the salon owner to lead the house of representatives because she set up think of it she set up the speaker of the house that was a big mistake as soon as i heard she said well she set me up nancy you\\'re not supposed to get set up you\\'re representing our country you know what she should have done honestly she should have said i made a mistake sorry and nobody would be talking about this is like the biggest story this would be crazy nancy highly overrated person let me just say she is a highly overrated person they give her such good play she is a highly overrated person look they just turned off a camera because they don\\'t want me saying that [Applause] so just in closing we will rapidly return to full employment soaring wages and record prosperity we will hire more police increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and banned sanctuary cities we will appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law not their own political agenda we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens we will not let them threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of endless foreign wars we will end surprise medical bill we don\\'t want surprise medical billing you know what happens it\\'s terrible but we have ended it and also we\\'ve signed something that\\'s incredible you\\'re going to see some people say it\\'s bigger than healthcare and i signed it unfortunately it takes place on january 1st you better elect me it\\'s called price transparency [Applause] i said to my people the other day when is price transparency this is going to lower your prices by 50 you\\'ll be able to negotiate you\\'ll be able to do things you\\'re not even allowed to do now with hospitals with doctors you get better doctors you get lower prices i said when does it start and it\\'s a complicated oh did i get i was fought you have no idea right fellas you were fought too but they fought me on this price transparency it\\'s bigger than health care could be bigger than health care but i said when does it start they said sir we have it all set when january 1st i said i better win this election this year because you\\'re going to see some unbelievable price reductions and that includes on drugs because we\\'re reducing health insurance premiums massively and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years last year but now it\\'s going to go down very big because we did a favored nations laws and i see the drug companies are they\\'re killing me with ads they have nothing but cash they have nothing but money and they\\'re spending because they can\\'t believe you know germany and other countries pay much less than we do and we want to have what we have to have is we have to have a comparison of prices and that\\'s what it\\'s called favorite nations laws i instituted a favor so if we\\'re paying 2.50 cents for a pill and some nation is paying 10 cents for the same exact bill from the same factory right we get the 10 cent price so what\\'s going to happen that\\'ll go up ours will come way down they can\\'t believe it the drug companies can\\'t believe and i will tell you mark meadows is here our chief of staff [Music] they want to negotiate they called we signed it it\\'s all done they want to negotiate and they are negotiating so uh let\\'s see what happens but we\\'re going to get you cuts on prescription drugs the likes of which you\\'ve never seen will protect medicare and social security they will not be able to protect it it will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always america will land the first woman on the moon and the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars when i took over nasa was dead now it\\'s the most vibrant space center in the world by far we will restore patriotic education to our schools and we\\'ll teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust for years you had a president who apologized for america now you have a president who is

we had great great luck and great people backing us in north carolina and i\\'m thrilled to be in winston-salem with thousands of loyal hard-working american patriots you are great people great people i don\\'t know how many people here but there\\'s a lot [Applause] we said let\\'s keep it down they didn\\'t do too good a job but that\\'s good right that\\'s good now these crowds i tell you it\\'s beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm beyond what we had four years ago in 2016 and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot this is the most important election we\\'ve ever had 56 days from now we\\'re going to win north carolina we\\'re going to win four more years in the white house this is a choice and i must say this is a choice for many many decades i don\\'t think you\\'ve had a bigger difference and maybe you\\'ve never had a bigger difference this is the american dream and the other i don\\'t want to say it because i\\'ll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there but the other is a basic disaster for our country joe biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs throwing open your borders dragging us into endless foreign wars along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children\\'s future to countries like china remember this very simple to remember if biden wins china wins it\\'s as simple as that so you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world we were forced to close it because of the china plague that came in and now we\\'ve opened it and by the way your state should be open your state should be open you ought to vote for dan forrest any governor that does that and even if you look statistically it\\'s you it\\'s michigan it\\'s a couple of others they\\'re closed new york look look what they\\'re doing in new york what they\\'re doing to our beautiful new york oh it\\'s so sad but you just take a look at what\\'s going on in north carolina they want to open they want to open they want to open in michigan so badly they want to open they want to have football they want to have their schools open and it\\'s a shame what\\'s going on and i\\'ll tell you what uh on november 4th every one of those states will be open they\\'re doing it for political reasons no they\\'re doing it for political reasons they think by hurting the economy by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings offices they think by keeping them and hurting them you\\'re hurting the economy our economy is doing phenomenally well and it\\'s not only is it a v it\\'s a super v you see what\\'s happened we just had a jobs number come out 1.4 million it\\'s down to 8.4 percent nobody thought that 8.4 so we had the greatest economy we closed it up and now we\\'re opening it up and your state should go with it we\\'re opening it up and we will have a great third quarter it\\'s going to be announced by the way just before the election but we\\'re going to have a great third quarter we have unbelievable retail numbers unbelievable numbers all over and this is that super v but next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of our country economically and unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody\\'s taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven\\'t seen and remember this if biden wins the violent mobs you see these mobs all over the place they\\'re biden people they\\'re biden states and cities they\\'re democrat states if they win the mobs when you see these guys they go around saying yeah i want you a meal give me that food give me the a woman sitting there she wants to eat and they come they grab her food they grab her drink nobody\\'s ever seen stuff like this this is all that ideology we\\'re not going to let it happen we\\'re not going to let it happen and you know in portland you see what happened last night they arrested over 50 people the first time we said either do it or we\\'re going in we\\'re going to have to go in do it let us go in we\\'re saying i spoke to the governor of oregon the other day let us go in i said let us go in we\\'ll straighten it out in less than a half an hour now the u.s marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody you saw that he killed a young man in the middle of the street violently he had other charges against him and i put out when is he going to be arrested and they went in about 15 minutes later and i\\'ll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go all they have to do is call us it\\'ll all be solved very quickly they have to call us but all of these places are democrat run places radical left-run places they don\\'t know what the hell they\\'re doing if biden wins the rioters arsonists and anarchists win he said the other day well you know if i win that doesn\\'t mean that\\'s going to stop he doesn\\'t he will never stop if they win it\\'s not going to happen hopefully but if because this is not like a second place crowd let\\'s face it and are you seeing are you seeing the are you seeing all the poll numbers are coming out that\\'s why he left finally he left his basement he said we got problems i don\\'t think he knows that but the people that manage him know it they understand it he does it so i\\'m running for re-election to keep jobs at home to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to america not to china and other countries because if we win america wins you know that you\\'ve seen that you\\'ve seen what we\\'ve done over the last three and a half years we\\'ve secured america\\'s borders fixed our broken trade deals and they were broken like you\\'ve never seen they weren\\'t even broken they were bad they were bad from day one rebuilt the awesome power of the united states military obliterated the isis caliphate 100 in fact i got it down to 98 remember a year and a half ago i got it down to 98 and they all said no no it\\'s got to be a hundred i said somebody else could finish we want to get home they said no you got to finish it so we took another two months we finished it and we\\'re bringing them home we\\'re bringing them home these great great warriors but people don\\'t like it when i say that secured american energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we are very simply we\\'re doing it again and we\\'re on track to have as i said the best year we\\'ve ever had next year you just had the best you know you just had the best year of the history of your state last year we\\'ve created a record-breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months next year will be the single greatest economic year in the history of our country and probably in the history of your state if your governor ever opens up but hopefully you\\'re going to have dan forest you\\'re not going to have to worry about it but if sleepy joe biden takes power the economy will collapse he won\\'t even know the difference how\\'s the economy not good so we\\'re in a depression or we are what\\'s that joe biden has spent 47 years shipping north carolina jobs to china and other countries you know that and i\\'ve spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country we never had so many jobs we\\'re up to 160 million jobs we were never anywhere close we got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that here in north carolina voting is already underway on november 3rd americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left-wing extremists that have no idea what they\\'re doing to burn down buildings or take control of government set fire to a whole country you know when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago right i signed a very strong executive order you want to knock him down that\\'s fine but you go to jail for 10 years it was amazing it was amazing how that stopped and then they said well we\\'ll do it easily we\\'ll do it through the process because you know they don\\'t want to spend 10 years you know they\\'d look at it they\\'d say not worth it 10 years is too much but the d.c committee did you see about that they want to change the name of the washington monument they want to get rid of the lincoln monument jefferson monument now we\\'re talking the big stuff they finally hit the big time took them a while to get there but i said that was going to happen don\\'t worry about it you don\\'t have a thing to worry about if our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple america they could hardly do better than the biden kamala harris kamala remember kamala she started at 15 she was supposed to win problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four it\\'s like a free fall you know why people don\\'t like her nobody likes her she could never be the first woman president she could ever be that would be an insult to our country biden wants to impose a four trillion dollar tax hike a ban on american energy eliminate america\\'s borders confiscate your guns he wants to get rid of your second amendment a point we\\'re going to be appointing very pro-crime judges but they want to destroy your suburbs you want to you know that you know the rule the regulation that i just terminated they want to build low-income projects in the suburbs they\\'ve been doing it they\\'ve been destroying suburbs we\\'re not doing it anymore somebody said suburban women how\\'s trump doing but do you remember last time too they said women don\\'t like trump i said i think they do i think they do no they said women don\\'t and though we did great with women remember that great was that one of the greatest evenings ever four years ago that was one of the greatest but one of the things they did first of all we did much better now we\\'re doing really well african-american vote much better hispanic vote much better he did better with african-americans that we thought he did better with hispanic than we thought he did better with asians than we thought he did really well with women what\\'s this all about you know ladies and gentlemen and they said donald trump is projected the winner of 2016 you remember that evening was that the craziest that was the craziest thing and they thought i think they didn\\'t think it but i\\'ll tell you what anything we had then we have much more now they don\\'t understand they do understand it they do right they understand it look at that beautiful dress and she wears that dress right through the middle of hollywood and everyone says thank you very much beautiful but they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruinous shutdown of the united states economy again biden said the other day well if the experts told me we\\'re not shutting it down again we don\\'t have to we learned about the disease we did the right thing we saved millions of lives people don\\'t realize we save millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting china we put a ban on china heavily infected and biden was against it three months later he said he did the right thing i have to admit it\\'s clear why both china and the flag-burning rioters want biden to win they know his policies will be the downfall of america and they know my policies will lift america to new heights of national greatness like we\\'ve never seen before that\\'s what\\'s happening that\\'s what\\'s happening and never forget they\\'re coming after me because i\\'m fighting for you there\\'s a lot of truth in that one and they do come after me they do come after me they have more things to say about me every day at something they said you don\\'t see the plane where it is sir would you like to take the car and say why i\\'m saying what well i heard you had a limp i do i don\\'t know about a limp hey someday i\\'m gonna have a limp i\\'ll let you know when you\\'ll see it no they make this stuff up they make it up they make stuff it\\'s called disinformation they give a phony deal out they did it two days ago with the military there\\'s nobody who loves the military more than me so they make they make you know i was very lucky though i had 15 incredible american patriots that came by and they said he never said that we were they were there they were there but they make up stories horrible stories many many hey look look at last time the uh fake dirty dossier it was all made up and frankly if the shoe was on the other foot right if it was on the other foot you\\'d have many people 20 25 people right now in jail for two years and they\\'d be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it\\'s treason or whatever else you want to call it and it\\'s a disgrace that has taken this long it\\'s a disgrace that has taken this long and let me just tell you a little secret obama got caught and so did sleepy joe biden [Applause] remember biden sitting in the room saying why don\\'t you use the logan act on general flynn look at general flynn what he\\'s going through for years if that were ever reversed i\\'m telling you you\\'d have many people in jail for many many years and it would have started two years ago it\\'s a disgrace but let\\'s see what happens biden\\'s a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to american communities and you know he talks about like well he\\'s going to do this he\\'s going to he doesn\\'t have any idea he has no clue he\\'s going to do this he\\'s been there for 47 years and you know he just really left you know he left three and a half four years ago right so he just left but he\\'s been there for 47 years i\\'m going to do this you know after 47 years he\\'s had a change of heart this is the craziest election this is the craig look somebody said what\\'s the difference between crooked hillary clinton and slo joe so the difference is the following she\\'s meaner probably not as nice i don\\'t know you can\\'t get any worse than her [Applause] but the big difference is she\\'s smarter than he is okay he\\'s a nicer person but he\\'s not smart he never was not in prime time and certainly not now the washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party\\'s nomination biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left you know that with crazy bernie and everyone and by the way you know who\\'s further left than crazy bernie kamala kamala kamala you remember she left the race sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory they should be able to win california i don\\'t know maybe we\\'ll make a play for that one too but they picked somebody from california i don\\'t i don\\'t quite get it but you always pick somebody that\\'s hot that\\'s going up in the polls right going up frankly i\\'m not sure i don\\'t think i\\'ve ever said this but probably hillary should have picked bernie sanders to be her running mate right because you know as crazy as it sounds he was hot he gave her a hell of a fight a lot of people think he won and it got taken away one thing about bernie\\'s the greatest loser i\\'ve ever seen because look any children here no not too many but they\\'ve heard it before he got screwed four years ago when he got screwed again [Music] you know biden got the nomination right he got the nomination but if biden would have sat back and if elizabeth warren pocahontas you remember pocahontas right she finally faded she faded badly but if she would have dropped out on super tuesday prior to super tuesday bernie would have been the nominee and i don\\'t know who i\\'d rather run against one is super left the other one\\'s had to become super left one is competent the other one is only half competent now and heading south he\\'s half competent and heading south rapidly but the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they\\'re united by their contempt for the american middle class in the truest sense that\\'s why powerful corporations and far-left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over if you look at that it\\'s over the law abiding areas that we have you know republican cities and towns are doing great we\\'re doing great and we don\\'t have crime and we don\\'t have this violence chicago over the weekend many people killed many people shot shot they\\'re actually shot and killed new york the same thing new york\\'s gone through the roof they\\'re up 300 percent in certain categories and you say what\\'s happening and we want to send them in so badly joe biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through democrat-run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters and you know we call you peaceful protesters you know why because they have rules in these democrat-run states that if you\\'re campaigning you can\\'t have more than five people they did that for me if you\\'re going to church you can\\'t go to church anymore you can\\'t go to church you can\\'t go to church you can\\'t do anything you have to stay in your house but if you\\'re willing to riot running down main street if you\\'re willing to riot and stand on top of each other\\'s face and do whatever the hell you want to do you\\'re allowed to do that because you\\'re considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests instead of standing up to the far left riders biden condemns law enforcement and condemns america didn\\'t even mention the words that we love and respect law and order you know they\\'re all telling me even my people my very brilliant consultant so i don\\'t listen to too much maybe i should sir please don\\'t say law and order it\\'s too tough now in the meantime you look at these streets people crazy they say say law and order but with safety and whisky i said look people get it it\\'s just law and order is that okay lord we want law and order they say lord order and safety sir could you add the word safety because it\\'s sir i said i don\\'t want to it\\'s sort of obvious right we want law we want order biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that america is racist by the way i\\'ve gotten the support of almost every police group in the country sheriffs in florida ohio texas north carolina all over the country but did you notice he\\'s starting to talk a little bit tougher now did you notice that he sees what\\'s going on his poles are dropping like a rock and he sees what\\'s going on now he\\'s starting to say no we need uh law and order no he didn\\'t say that did he can\\'t he\\'ll never get to say that he can\\'t say that because then it lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party you take a look you don\\'t want to be dealing with the left these people are stone cold crazy you don\\'t want to be dealing meanwhile biden he doesn\\'t say a word about the thousands of african-americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in democrat-controlled cities they\\'re murdered by the thousands and they never ever mention it my heart is with the hard-working patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities not the violent criminals of extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful americans remember this these are biden supporters and if he wins they will be in charge of your government as sure as you\\'re sitting there you\\'ll be taking your monuments down you\\'ll be taking your statues down i\\'m not kidding you\\'ll be taking them down you have to look at the dc report i\\'m just telling you go get it you wouldn\\'t even believe it it\\'s too crazy to even talk about but we\\'re never going to give them a chance to do it we\\'re never giving them a chance we\\'re going to win we\\'re going to win big this is a very important state and by the way and by the way when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots when you get a ballot say well i wanted to go and vote darling i wanted to go and vote why are they sending me those ballots there\\'s something really the only way we lose north carolina and a couple of others like nevada we\\'re doing great there now the governor decides we\\'re doing so well that they\\'re going to send out unsolicited you have solicited and unsolicited they\\'re going to send out millions of ballots to you people that never really thought in terms of it now sometimes you\\'ll ask for a ballot that\\'s a solicited ballot it\\'s okay you have to go through a process you have to sign a form you get it sending out millions of unsolicited ballots make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts make sure it does because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things that\\'s the only way look at this you know if joe biden came here and made a car this is not the most convenient place you know it\\'s an airport hi fellas they did a good job guiding the planet they\\'re great they\\'re great no this is an airport if he were honestly i really if he had 200 people i think it would be a lot i really mean do you ever see the gyms with the circles that\\'s his crowd if he had 200 people i was told we have 15 000 people here tonight as far as the eye can see but they\\'ll correct it they\\'ll say he\\'s wrong it was 14 500 he\\'s misrepresented he\\'s misrepresenting now i always tell we have 15 000 and we\\'re in the middle of an airport someplace it\\'s a wonderful thing and you know i actually think i don\\'t know if you agree so we go to the arenas but because of uh china the arenas aren\\'t working out too well right you can\\'t really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn i will tell you we\\'re rounding the turn on that but because of that so we said where because we have the same crowds i think we have bigger crowds potentially we were in new hampshire the other night we had to turn away 8 000 people at an airport we\\'re doing all mostly hangar things because we\\'re outside outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors right but they say it\\'s very much different so we\\'re doing these and we\\'re doing the outdoors we\\'re doing the hangers but i i really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago it\\'s pretty amazing pretty amazing we started off in new hampshire we said look let\\'s have a thousand people and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more you know we\\'re trying to be nice but then eventually we landed two weeks ago we landed in new hampshire and the entire runway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and i mean it\\'s really amazing what\\'s going on all over the country it\\'s amazing it\\'s amazing it\\'s a great thing more support than we had four years ago because you know four years ago i said i was going to do this i was going to cut your taxes i was going to cut regulations i was going to get right to try i was going to take care of your vets i was going to rebuild your military i was going to do all these things and you said you said i don\\'t know that\\'s a lot of you know what i\\'ve actually done more than i promised build a wall build a wall true i\\'ve done more for instance you never heard me say you never heard me say you a lot of you were at various rallies you never heard me talking about space force we built a new think of it a new branch of the united states military united states armed forces called air force i never talked about that that\\'s something we never talked about i only figured that one out after i became president because i saw what russia was doing and what china was doing i said we have to do the same thing and if you think that was easy that was not easy that was not easy it was very hard but what we\\'ve done you know the wall now is past 300 miles it\\'s exactly the wall that our great border patrol wanted i was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here boom boom you put it sir we have to be able to see through i said all right let\\'s go much more expensive and i said let\\'s go so we\\'re over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we\\'ve ever had by far and it\\'s a good time to have it too and you know mexico is paying for the wall just so you understand they don\\'t say that they never say it but we\\'re going to charge a small fee at the border you know the toll booths we have to say that it\\'s the biggest border in the world in terms of people going across and in terms of industry believe it or not the southern border we\\'re putting a small toll on and maybe we\\'re going to do something with remittance that\\'s where people come here make money and they send it back so we\\'ll do something and we\\'re going to get all the money that we spent in the mall wall will be coming back so remember i used to say who\\'s going to pay for it they\\'d say mexico life that\\'s right that\\'s right mexico is going to buy it and what happens if they fight us remember that answer it\\'s going to get 10 feet higher remember what happens if they fight us on the wall the wall is going to get 10 feet higher but now mexico and i get along great in fact they have 27 000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming into our country can you imagine that so 27 000 [Applause] and i did that so that we don\\'t put tariffs on their products coming in it was very simple i said you got to do it and the president\\'s been great he\\'s a friend of mine he\\'s doing a very good job not easy mexico\\'s not easy but he\\'s doing a very good job but the wall is almost completed and it\\'s a tremendous wall it\\'s everything that the border patrol people wanted i gave him everything i said what else do you want and it\\'s wired for every single thing you could have remember the democrats we don\\'t want a wall we want drones flying oh that helps us a lot drones so you can watch everybody pour into our country right biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail just last week sleepy joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police portland district attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters vandals criminals and violent extremists without charge now last night though they arrested more than they\\'ve ever done because we said you have to we said you have to and we told them about we will federalize them we\\'ll do whatever you need and i spoke to the governor it looks like they\\'re finally after 107 days like they\\'re finally doing what they\\'re supposed to be doing but we\\'ll let you know very soon otherwise we\\'re going in the biden birdie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide now you\\'ve got to understand bernie\\'s a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and i got a lot of bernie voters i think 15 last time because they agree with me on trade they understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off they\\'re ripping us off on trade i agree with him on that the difference is i know how to do something about it they don\\'t they don\\'t have a clue they just know they\\'re being ripped off and a lot of bernie people feel that that\\'s a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of crooked hillary which was a very nice thing we appreciate it we hope we don\\'t lose it because we\\'ve really implemented things you know we\\'ve taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for china from china and china has never given us 10 cents it\\'s a one-way street with china they haven\\'t given us we signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn\\'t dry when the plague came in so i view that trade deal as uh much differently than i did before much differently it\\'s a great deal they just last week they ordered the biggest order of corn in history the biggest order of soybeans in history and i say just shows you though they\\'re smart very smart instead of saying you know he\\'s not talking very nicely about us and we\\'re not going to order any more we\\'re not going to do business no instead they do the opposite they give us the biggest orders we\\'ve our farmers are very happy our farmers are very happy biggest order of corn biggest order of beef biggest order of soybeans and i gave the farmers 28 billion dollars because that\\'s what you were targeted for by china and i gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the u.s treasury but nobody\\'s ever done this before nobody\\'s ever done this before with biden it\\'s the reverse his son goes sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage he\\'ll make millions of dollars a year and he has no experience at all never happened before biden\\'s plan is to appease the domestic terrorists my plan is to arrest them so on november 3rd america faces a very simple choice do what you want vote for the candidate backed by violent left-wing rioters if you have to or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else when you see the numbers when you see them you know there was a poll that just came out it was i think it was gallup and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62 of the people that are polled are lying i said that\\'s a big number right i think it was 62 percent a couple of weeks ago it came out and they\\'re only lying if it\\'s us because they don\\'t want to be bothered in other words they\\'re not lying about sleepy joe they\\'re lying about us and i don\\'t know if i\\'m supposed to love that or hate it i don\\'t know if it\\'s an insult to that but i will take it we don\\'t give a damn but if that\\'s the case we have a virtual landslide going we have a virtual live cycle and this would look like we\\'re joined tonight by some really great friends of mine representatives senators just some incredible people people that have really helped me and we have to get them in office and let\\'s start off with senator tom tillis thank you he\\'s been by my side thank you tom very much representatives greg murphy virginia foxx mark walker dan bishop and ted budd what a group what a group water group thank you fellas they\\'re warriors boy i\\'ll tell you those house guys they were in there they were fighting for us we were 196 to nothing right when uh crazy nancy impeached us right they impeached me for making a phone call that was perfect it was a perfect call i\\'ll go down as the only president in history that got impeached for making an absolutely perfect phone call thank goodness i had the call because they totally misrepresented what was on the call if you ever heard the shifty shift get up in congress and say what i said if i ever said that it would have been terrible but you know what fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word we had the call perfectly and if i didn\\'t have it somehow with these people i guess i\\'d still be here if you want to know that too but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing the republicans stuck together and kevin mccarthy\\'s done a fantastic job he really has and with the exception of a half a vote from mitt romney you can have him [Music] he\\'s not too popular i want to tell you he\\'s not a very popular guy in utah he\\'s not too popular so he\\'s 52 and a half to a half he\\'s uh he\\'s a beauty i\\'ll tell you that guy he couldn\\'t get elected dog catcher in utah right now remember utah they said it\\'s too close to call this was before the election and then they announced utah the polls are closed donald trump has won the state of utah do you remember that like immediately i won by

he said you\\'re allowed to have ten people in the arena ten because it said one room ten you\\'re not supposed to have political rallies i said you know the money that your state is going to be losing but if this guy doesn\\'t open up your stay because almost all of them are open now if he doesn\\'t open up your state you have no choice you\\'re going to vote for him anyway but dan you\\'ll

cheat crowds are meaningless really if they\\'re going to cheat these big beautiful crowds you can have 15 000 you could have 50 000 these crowds are meaningless watch it be pole watches when you go there watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do because this is important we win north carolina we win we\\'re going to win florida i just left florida we\\'re going to win florida [Applause] and north carolina republican party chairman michael watley great thank you michael thank you great job [Applause] and a very good friend of mine a great guy mick mulvaney where\\'s mick oh i didn\\'t know mick was here look at him what a good guy thank you mick we have a lot of big big shots over there i see but what do you think about a guy named mark meadows chief of state we love mark doing a great job he\\'s doing a great job robert o\\'brien robert how many how many hostages have you and i negotiated to get back not giving anything but we have a record of what robert 50 50 you know we\\'re 50-000 hostages we got him back we got hostages back from countries that you never even heard of and it\\'s been pretty amazing robert thank you very much and thank you all for being here mick it\\'s good to see you oh wait a minute wait it\\'s a very very outstanding senator oh i\\'m lucky i got to see that does everybody do we love south carolina right come here lindsey graham everybody lindsey graham lindsey and tim scott two great ones two great ones they may be from a different state but they love you lindsay that\\'s good and tim is another one so we have just incredible people in the party we\\'ve achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that\\'s driving them crazy we passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations more than any president in history whether it was four years eight years or in one case more regulations [Music] [Applause] and to keep family farms in the family we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses remember you that was a terrible thing people were fighting for that your family lost the farm lost their small business because they had to go and pay this ridiculous estate tax or debt tax as they call it and now you don\\'t have to worry about it if you love your children you leave it to them if you don\\'t live love your children then it doesn\\'t matter what i did don\\'t leave it to him give it to charity give it this help no if they\\'re not good to you if you don\\'t love but does anybody here not love their children please raise your hand you nobody good i love that that\\'s oh look at that one you\\'re gonna love that one i guarantee you i guarantee you\\'re going to love that one that\\'s a keeper that\\'s a keeper right that\\'s great you\\'ll love that one someday in a long time from now that beautiful child will not have to worry about estate taxes unless the democrats do something in between but we don\\'t think no but it was a terrible thing you\\'d pass away and your kids would get the farm they\\'d go out borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive they\\'d put big mortgages on the farm they\\'d lose the farm they\\'d lose the business you don\\'t have that anymore it saved the u.s auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration\\'s job-killing catastrophe the trans-pacific partnership was a disaster for half a century joe biden shook hands with blue collar workers and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back biden supported nafta china\\'s entry into the world trade organization tpp the south korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens think of it but but the big news he\\'s changed he\\'s changed after 47 years i\\'ve changed i swear to you i\\'ve changed did you see him in the debates he was not too good but that\\'s okay he was better against bernie something\\'s going on there i don\\'t know you know what i\\'m talking about but he was better against bernie but in the other debates he was giving them everything he wants everything they want free health care for people to come into the country illegally colleges everything now the new deal under the new deal they get lawyers if they come in to our country illegally we supply them with legal advice you believe it lawyers this is what we need as more lawyers this state lost 43 percent of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of nafta and china\\'s entrance into the world trade organization that\\'s courtesy of biden and his friends earlier this year i kept my promise to north carolina when we ended the nafta nightmare and we signed the brand new u.s mexico canada agreement into law been incredible everyone said impossible they all said it was impossible to get done we got it done and it\\'s a great deal and it prevents people it prevents companies from fleeing your state opening up in mexico or canada making a product selling it to us with it\\'s such a disincentive to do that now that was the thing that was most important to me i used to hate when i see all these companies leaving our country going to mexico in particular but canada also a lot of them going to canada and they\\'d make a product everybody gets fired in our country they close their business and they make the same product in a different country they send it back to us no tax at the border no tariff no nothing it doesn\\'t work that way anymore i took the toughest ever action to stand up to china\\'s pillaging plundering ransacking and rampant theft of north carolina jobs and u.s jobs joe biden\\'s agenda is made in china my agenda is made in the usa in the face of china\\'s economic aggression we provided a historic 28 billion dollars in relief to our amazing farmers i will always stand with american agriculture these are the greatest people the finest people and we\\'re not going to let others take advantage of them you know for 20 years for 20 years you look at a chart it\\'s just been this way for 20 years now it\\'s going back up i mean it helped that i gave you 28 billion dollars in all fairness right if i didn\\'t do that and i took it all from china it was very easy if i didn\\'t do that i think you wouldn\\'t have any farmers right now really there was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers 28 billion over two years they got hit one year 16 billion one year 12 billion i said to sonny perdue secretary of agriculture great guy an ex-farmer governor of georgia for eight years great guy i said sonny how much are they being targeted for he said sir 12 12 billion dollars for the year before and last year sir it was 16 so i said 28 okay that\\'s fine i said we will give them 28 billion they were unfairly targeted and that was in order to get me and by the way china wants joe biden so badly oh they want you know who else would like them very badly iran would like them very badly because i ended that iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion in cash and you know what\\'s going to happen they\\'re just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes their gdp went down 24 percent nobody ever heard of that before their country is in trouble i don\\'t want them to be in trouble but they\\'re going to wait until after the election when i win the election they\\'re going to come to us and make a deal so fast watch how fast it\\'ll be they\\'re dying to make a deal but they do want to wait let\\'s wait two months maybe we\\'ll get lucky maybe we\\'re gonna get lucky and slow joe gets in and we\\'re going to make a great deal no they\\'ll be they\\'ll be in immediately after the election and they\\'ll make a deal we\\'ll make a fair deal with them but what obama did and biden did with that horrible iran deal i ended last administration\\'s war on american energy biden has pledged to end production of american oil shale clean coal no fracking wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters we don\\'t want to buy energy we\\'ve done that for a long time for decades and decades we don\\'t want to do that anymore i like being energy independent don\\'t you and i\\'m sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car oftentimes it\\'s below two dollars you said how the hell did this ever happen thank you president right thank you president trump [Applause] and look at your electric bills everything else these guys your electric would go up four five six times the green new deal it\\'s called the green new nightmare while i\\'m president america will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent it should be for many many years to come because the fact is we don\\'t have to be in the middle east other than we want to protect israel we\\'ve been very good to israel but other than that we don\\'t have to be in the middle east we don\\'t need you know there was a time we needed desperately or we don\\'t need that anymore we have more than they do isn\\'t that nice after years of rebuilding other countries we are finally building our country america first it\\'s america first to bring hope to our inner cities i created opportunity zones i worked with senator tim scott of south carolina what a great guy he has passed criminal justice reform prison reform delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that obama never did or couldn\\'t do and biden i call it oh biden oh biden\\'s too long to say obama and but just call it obide and before the china virus we achieved the lowest african-american hispanic american asian-american unemployment rates ever recorded and we\\'re heading back to that level rapidly biden spent the last 47 years betraying african-american voters he betrayed them look at 19 94. take a look at that he betrayed them what he did to them he closed the factories in baltimore and sent them to beijing they were all sent to beijing so many people went there they went to all parts of the world but a lot went to beijing he shuddered the plants in chicago and sent them to shanghai unlike the previous administration under my administration we put america first and actually if we weren\\'t interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere and nobody has been through what i\\'ve been through as president of the united states nobody you know they used to say abraham lincoln got the worst press i said there\\'s no way he got worse than me but lincoln was very very badly treated by the fake news maybe in his case it was real i can tell you in my case it\\'s fake it\\'s totally fake but nobody\\'s been and it should never be allowed to happen again let\\'s see what happens we caught him cold let\\'s see what happens [Music] but if we didn\\'t have to you know that takes time and energy and all of the things the time that we spent on this impeachment hoax nancy pelosi with her hair dryer and the whole thing everybody has to wear a mask you must keep all beauty parlors closed then she\\'s in her beauty brother with no mask oh and then she said the biggest the biggest first she could have said okay she just said you got me but she said i got set up by the beauty parlor owner who happens to be a trump person by the way [Music] i like the beauty parlor first she said i got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor now she set me up i said how you gonna do with putin kim jong-un and president xi of china [Applause] no it\\'s terrible she\\'s always preaching about the mask you gotta wear the mask at all times indoor outdoor when you go to bed at night put the mask on i\\'ve spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the african-american community and when i\\'m reelected the best is yet to come i\\'ll tell you [Applause] perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration under my administration we\\'ve achieved the most secure border in american history and i have to tell you that 300 miles of wall helps a lot remember they said walls are old-fashioned they don\\'t work really i always say and i\\'ve said it four or five times i\\'ll say it again if you\\'d like me to two things if you come back in a thousand years two thousand years or three thousand years if you\\'re lucky enough assuming we have something with with the world is a crazy place isn\\'t it but if you come back in a thousand years there are two things with all the computers and all the everything changes every day you invent a new cell you invent a new laptop everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invented right two things that will never get obsolete the wall and the wheel right a wheel and a wall maybe i\\'m wrong who knows but i would say walls and wheels have a great future we ended catch and release stopped asylum fraud and we\\'ve deported 20 000 gang members including the radical ms-13 we invested 2.5 trillion dollars in the united states military all made in the usa by the way [Applause] we have the newest finest military we\\'ve ever had and gave our great warriors their largest pay raisers in many many decades [Applause] we passed va choice and va accountability which everybody said could not happen and veteran satisfaction with the va has just reached 91 percent the highest satisfaction level in history i withdrew from the last administration\\'s disastrous iran nuclear deal as i said and i kept my promise and recognized the true capital of israel and opened the united states embassy in jerusalem and then i recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the middle east piece for many many decades decades even the new york times said that was an amazing achievement you believe that i said let me see that one no we did something that nobody thought was possible and it\\'s israel as you see and as you\\'ve read israel and uae highly respected leader mohammed highly respected and now we have other countries in the middle east they all want to come in it\\'s going to be a beautiful picture it\\'s going to be a beautiful picture [Applause] we killed the vicious founder and leader of isis al baghdadi we killed him why didn\\'t biden get him you know they were after him for eight years they never got him i got him the world\\'s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of american troops kasim solomony we got him to salomani [Applause] al baghdadi and salamandi the two worst terrorists in the world for many many years many decades we kept america out of new wars and we\\'re bringing our troops back home we\\'re bringing them back home from all these faraway places we spend hundreds of billions of dollars and what do we get out of it biden voted for the iraq war he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden he opposed the killing of salamani he oversaw the rise of isis and for eight years he couldn\\'t find or kill al-baghdadi the founder of isis couldn\\'t find them they looked they couldn\\'t find them i found them and we hit them good we hit them good and you saw the mueller family on television you saw that at the convention what al baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter and uh incredible how our troops handled that you should see it it was incredible biden also cheered the rise of china as a positive development positive development for america and for the world how we doing with china we just have the plague we\\'ve had other plagues sent by them i wonder if they did it on purpose what do you think [Applause] i got to tell you i was sailing to an easy election this was going to be so easy i probably would have not been here tonight i would have said no we don\\'t have to bother this was gonna be and now we have to work against the guy that doesn\\'t know where he is i can\\'t believe it when i banned travel from china biden called it hysterical and xenophobic do you remember that i banned it everybody told me no no no you don\\'t have to do that but i said we have to because wuhan is very infected and they\\'re coming here so i banned it later on it was said to be a great move if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died if biden wins china will own america and it won\\'t take long with his son hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever no investment he didn\\'t even have a job joe biden is weak and will always cave to china who is strong when the virus arrived we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii we\\'re delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers the case fatality rates we have the lowest of any major country in the world people don\\'t know that because the fake news doesn\\'t want to write about it under operation warp speed we\\'re producing a vaccine in record time this is a vaccine that we\\'re going to have very soon very very soon by the end of the year but much sooner than that perhaps and this is something that\\'s incredible this would have taken two or three years by the last administration and in all fairness by most other administrations we have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible and totally safe joe biden and kamala harris rated the most liberal are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that\\'s what they\\'re talking about so now they know we have it it\\'s only a question of weeks or a small amount of time so instead of saying that\\'s a great thing we\\'re going to save lives they\\'re trying to disparage it they\\'re trying to make it politics they\\'re trying to do so and now what\\'s going to happen is we\\'ll have it and people won\\'t want to take it that\\'s really bad okay that\\'s really bad but the biden harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we are close to putting it out getting it out and we\\'re going to get it out fast the vaccine will be safe these are the greatest companies in the world that do this the greatest labs the greatest doctors it\\'ll be effective and it\\'ll be delivered before the end of the year and maybe as i said much sooner than that joe biden\\'s plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide drugs alcohol abuse heart disease and much more and that\\'s what you\\'re in right now you\\'re in a shutdown it\\'s crazy i\\'ve been to many states they\\'re not in shutdowns and they\\'re doing better they\\'re doing better somebody\\'s got to speak to this man dan maybe you got to talk to him dan go in a little early and say you don\\'t know what the hell you\\'re doing you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing they\\'re hurting hurting our people north carolina has to open up [Applause] by contrast my administration is following the science protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work into school go back to school go back to school you ever see the statistics on young people i don\\'t know they just they have a great immune system let\\'s get some of that immune system but they\\'re amazing i mean thousands and thousands of people and they\\'re not even affected very little meaning a small percentage of one percent it\\'s an incredible thing nobody knew that when it first came here nobody assumed a thing like that was possible but young people are very strong against this horrible disease through our historic china virus relief programs we\\'ve saved more than 1.3 million jobs for north carolina workers that worked out great we provided 380 million dollars in relief for north carolina farmers and made 10 million dollars in ppp loans to save your state\\'s tobacco growers we save your tobacco growers we have them very much in our sites we want to help them the biden agenda would crush this come back and put our families in grave danger biden is promising to reimpose job destroying regulations we got rid of more regulations he wants to put those regulations back plus 50 percent you couldn\\'t build a road we took roads from 18 19 and even 20 years approval down to two and we\\'ll have it down to one and you may get rejected for a highway or for a road but you\\'re gonna know in the period of 12 months to 24 months you\\'re not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand i know all about it from the real estate business we brought it all the way down he wants to give illegal aliens government health care and taxpayer-funded lawyers establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records you wouldn\\'t believe i mean this stuff is not even really believable but it is what it is he wants to surge refugee admissions by 700 into our country flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants including many from jihadist regions of the world biden opposes school choice he opposes north carolina opportunity scholarships and he has stated that if he is elected charter schools are gone he said they\\'re gone and they\\'ve been incredible in a second term i\\'ll provide school choice to every parent in america and we\\'ll also take good care of our teachers our teachers are very very important to me very important nothing more important a vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities great jobs and a limitless future for all americans and just in finishing i have to say that over the next four years we will make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on china once and for all we\\'ll make our medical supplies right here in the united states [Applause] we will enact fair trade deals that create american jobs and grow american wages we\\'re going to bring our companies back home where they should be and i\\'ve been doing a lot of it but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible we will rapidly return to full employment soaring wages and record prosperity we will hire more police increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities we will protect government benefits for american citizens not for illegal aliens what you\\'re doing when you have all of these advantages when you\\'re giving them free health care and free lawyers and free college and free everything they all come they didn\\'t think of coming but they see this they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in they want to come to america you\\'re just bringing people in and we don\\'t want to do that we want people to come to our country but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally very simple we will appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law not their own political agenda we will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race color religion and creed we will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we will uphold religious liberty free speech and the right to keep and bear arms we will strike down terrors to threaten our citizens and we will keep america out of endless ridiculous foreign wars we\\'ll build up our military like it\\'s never been built up before we need our military for other reasons we will have the strongest we have now when i took over our military was depleted we have a lot of military people here our military was depleted our planes were 50 years old now you have brand new beautiful f-35s we have brand new rockets and missiles we and hopefully we never have to use them i will say that but the best way of not having to use them is to have them if you have them we learned that in the school yards right we learned that in the schoolyards the best way is to have them we have the strongest military we\\'ve ever had by far will end surprise medical billing require price transparency which i\\'ve already signed into law which by the way kicks in on january 1st you better elect me north carolina i did price transparency and i\\'ve cut the price drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody\\'s ever seen favored nations [Applause] so he did price transparency kicks in january first could you imagine if this guy\\'s president and your prices go way down hospitalization doctors you can choose your own doctor unlike with obama right price is going way down january first i said couldn\\'t you start it sooner but statutorily that\\'s when it had to start could you imagine if this guy\\'s in and prices start dropping like a rock and they\\'ll say what a great president he is he would have never done it and your drug prices prescription drug i\\'m instituting favored nations losses so we\\'re going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest end and you\\'re going to get back rebates that we were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world we\\'ll protect medicare and social security we will protect your social security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always always america will land the first woman on the moon in the united states will be the first nation to land an astronaut on mars very excited you know we reopened nasa that place was gone they had grass growing out of the runways you had to see it now it\\'s the number one space center in the world by far by far you see what\\'s going on there you see what\\'s going on we will restore patriotic education to our schools oh you know what i\\'m talking about look at you this is a very sophisticated group tom you know what i\\'m talking about patriotic education well the first thing they do is they want to take your history away [Applause] that\\'s a great group behind me i don\\'t know [Applause] they\\'re activists [Music] [Applause] no but you know what you know what it means they want to take away your history that\\'s why the monuments and the statues they want to knock them down the first thing they do is take away your guts you know it\\'s guts they take away your guts they take away your statues you take away your heroes they take away your great generals they take away your past and i said it was going to happen i said you know what they started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of and i thought that was bad and then they went up a little bit and i said you know someday it\\'s going to be robert e lee someday it\\'s going to be washington someday it\\'s going to be lincoln someday it\\'s going to be jefferson someday it\\'s going to be benjamin franklin it\\'s all of them it\\'s all of them they take away your past they\\'re never taken away our past then never take it away if that\\'s the way they do it you study it that\\'s the way they go they take away your guts and we\\'ll teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag and we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in god we trust [Applause] this is better than the arenas i have to say especially when you have a crowd like this but they\\'re like this they have such spirit in this country people love our country so much i went to texas i went to ohio went to florida it\\'s always it\\'s always like this they love they love our country and we\\'re not going to disappoint anybody we\\'re not disappointed for years you had a president who apologized for america [Applause] so you had a president who apologized for america now you have a president who is standing up for america and standing up for the people of north carolina this is the most important election in the history of our country and i wouldn\\'t say that lightly and frankly i thought the last one was and i said it but they\\'ve gone to a level that nobody even thought possible these people have gone stone cold crazy and you know what after we get in we\\'re gonna have tremendous success and it was building we were at a point we were so successful before the plague came in from china we were so successful that we were starting to get together people forget we were starting success brings people together it was so good our jobs numbers were so good and whether whether it was the black community the hispanic community the asian community our jobs were so good our numbers were so good there was no we were getting together and then the play came in and we had to stop we had to close it up we had to open it and start all over again and you know if you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock markets some of the stock markets have already broken every record you look at nasdaq you look at some we have we\\'re far ahead of what i had planned we\\'re far ahead of schedule but we did it once we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event a terrible event a horrible event so many people died nobody should have died not one person so many people died but if we didn\\'t do it right we would have been we would have lost millions of people millions of people and uh just a terrible thing but oftentimes i say bring people together and then i realized if you look at that last few months we were starting to come together i was getting calls from you won\\'t believe it democrats i was getting calls from democrats and they were sort of saying wow things are going really well it was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it\\'ll happen again there\\'ll be great unity eventually there\\'ll be great unity so get your friends and get your family get your neighbors and your co-workers and vote and i say this because it\\'s from charlotte to kitty hawk from durham to asheville

guys my name again is liz willis l-i-z-w-i-l-l-i-s that\\'s my instagram handle on twitter i think it\\'s the same thing so i also have a wonderful co-worker with me you can expect to see a lot more of him in the coming weeks for the next two months magnificent eventually he\\'s going to be basically on his own so we\\'re getting him ready to just take off at all these campaign stops i think you\\'re pretty much there but what did you think of today\\'s rally and how can people follow you and find out more about you mike yeah i gotta say you know of all the rallies i\\'ve been to i\\'ve been to at least 15 to 20. and this one by far had the most energy enthusiasm electricity i mean for the crowd to break out into a chain of we love you it actually gave me goosebumps i know that sounds cheesy but it did give me goosebumps because people for the first time maybe in their lifetime actually feel like there\\'s a president in office who\\'s fighting for them they feel like he is on their side he wants them to win we\\'ve never seen a president like this and i really feel that energy and that enthusiasm it really has you know a just a wide reaching feel like the feeling of love you feel that in this building you really do with the way people are smiling and cheering and just excited about this president it gets people fired up you know and i love that he hammered home that north carolina needs to be free i guess i didn\\'t really do my homework before we got to the state because i was unaware that north carolina was still locked down i find that to be so disappointing you know i don\\'t i don\\'t have any problem with anybody wants to wear a mask you know i understand people want to take precautions and decide to protect themselves but to be told that you have to cover your face restrict oxygen and airflow anywhere you go let alone an out there outdoor open-air event is just wrong the governor of this state needs to open it up and let their citizens be free and i\\'m happy that president trump gave that message because that\\'s what this state needs that\\'s what all states need to have is freedom and president trump represents freedom so that just goes to show you that on the ballot this november is voting for freedom or voting for whatever the democrats have for you which is not going to be nice so with that said i am so ecstatic to be with right side broadcasting i can\\'t wait for our next upcoming events we\\'re going to michigan on thursday and then liz engaged and the rest of the crew will be going out to nevada reno and then las vegas guys and before we go i just want to say thank you all for donating remember it\\'s your donations that allow us to go to these events please donate to our p.o box you can go

at president trump\\'s events if you want to follow me you can search magnificent on youtube it\\'s just like magnificent except you\\'re replacing mag with mike miknifin on youtube mikenibson813 on twitter instagram and all other social media platforms we are going to get this president re-elected period that\\'s the way it\\'s going to go and we\\'re going to come together as a country and overcome everything that the left has put us through and with that said guys we\\'re signing off thank you for tuning in to another right side broadcasting event of donald trump\\'s rallies president
