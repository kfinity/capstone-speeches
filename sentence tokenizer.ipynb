      "      unbelievable thank you hello green bay thank you in the great state of wisconsin home of the legendary green bay packers  and there's no place i'd rather be than right here in america's heartland right and there's no one i'd rather be within you the hard-working patriots who make our country run so well and it's running right now better maybe that it ever has thank you the strength of our nation is found in the heart of our people so true tonight america's heart is with the victims of the horrific synagogue shooting in poway california just happened our entire nation mourns the loss of life prays for the wounded and stands in solidarity with the jewish community we forcefully condemned the evil of anti-semitism and hate which must be defeated just happened and we are grateful to the law enforcement personnel for their courageous response incredible response today by law enforcement and i especially want to recognize a certain off-duty border patrol agent who bravely returned fire and helped disrupt the attack and saved so many lives border patrol  and i also want to thank mayor steve voss had a great conversation and governor gavin newsom had a great conversation and we stand together we will all get to the bottom of it we're gonna get to the bottom of a lot of things happening in our country  together we're building a new chapter of american greatness one founded on the idea that all citizens are entitled to live in safety prosperity and peace this is an exciting time for our great country this is an exciting time for america just yesterday it was an outset the united states economy grew some people thought unexpectedly not me i didn't think in fact frankly if we had the obama interest rates low almost nothing actually nothing and if we had quantitative easing instead of tightening we use this conservative approach we would have been even much higher than this but this is very high far greater first quarters always for the most part it's the lowest quarter we did 3.2 percent in the first quarter gdp crushing expectations and accelerating our economic boom and that was with a shutdown that was with a lot of different things that was with bad weather that was with everything you can imagine 3.2 in the first quarter usually the lowest and worse and prime minister robbie we're negotiating trade deals cuz every country has been ripping us off for years and i really like the prime minister he's a friend of mine but i said mr.\n",
      "prime minister forgot to do something for so many decades we've been losing tens of billions of dollars to china and japan and india and named any country yeah we lost but we're not losing anymore and i said listen we got to do something sixty eight billion dollars in trade losses over the last four or five years a year so we're renegotiating and i think he'll be fair i think he'll be four and by the way he he started by saying that he's putting 40 billion dollars into the united states for new car factories toyota's coming in with 14 billion dollars and they're coming in frankly to michigan they're coming back they want to be back to ohio to pennsylvania to north carolina south carolina florida and what's the name of this special place is called wisconsin  so they'll be investing very shortly and it started already 40 billion with the be forty billion dollars and it'll be a lot more than that the poverty rate for wisconsin families has reached the lowest rate in 22 years  the unemployment rate for wisconsin workers has reached historical has never been this low before ever ever ever think of that  never been historic law and we're now the number one economy anywhere in the world and it's not even close  by the way saturday night is there any place that's more fun than a trump rally  can you imagine sleepy joe crazy burnie you look at the candidates right i think pocahontas she's finished she's  no when it was found that i had more indian blood in me than she did and then it was determined that i had none but i still had more that was the end of her 32 year scam on colleges but can you imagine any of these people up here doing what i'm doing they'd be 200 people show up if they were president if they weren't president nobody would show up is that right  i have to say i was saying on the way over there tell me about bad weather by the way we may have to cancel tonight i said are you crazy how can you imagine i learned this morning they thought you're gonna have a big snowstorm right a big big saucer the people that get it wrong the most are the weather forecasters and the political analysts now they said there's a big big storm it's gonna be hitting green bay we may have to cancel i said like hell we're gonna cancel people are standing out 24 hours ago thirty two hours ago outside who stood out there for 24 hours thank you we love you thank you thank you and you know what and you rewarded with the best seats in the house right  america's futures never been brighter yet the democrats very friendly i've never been angrier than they are today you see somebody else with a very low level of energy we're supposed to be standing here instead of they wouldn't be in this room  that or not i got some problems i would say that but you know if you look two weeks out in 2016 i was going to rallies we were doing five and six like this and there were thousands of people outside just like there are right now we had sixty nine thousand people sign up to come in what is this place all in like 10 or 12 or whatever whatever it homes we set the record i just was told by the owners wizzy owner i don't know what the hell it halls but we just set the record  wizzy owner is this your record thank you thank you that's always dangerous he said yes it is sir so is dangerous yes like what no sir i'm dead they will take they will take that answer that'll be headlines thank you very much you saved me now this is the record we sent records everywhere and it's not me there's a movement like we've never seen in the history of but the radical liberal democrats put all their hopes behind their collusion delusion which has now been totally exposed to the world as a complete and total fraud the greatest political hoax in american history early husband so this witch-hunt was never really just about me it was always about stopping you the millions and millions of freedom-loving citizens who rose up on that incredible november day and demanded a government that puts america first ok and we're doing that with china we're doing that with india we're doing that with japan we're doing it with a great new trade deal that hopefully will get approved in the house i hope they go to approve it cuz it's great for the farmers everybody wants it everybody loves but we're all signed up and getting ready i guess in 30 days to put it in the u.s.\n",
      "mca like the song ymca right you remember us mca that's with mexico and canada it's a great deal and it's going to be very really good for manufacturers and really really because they have to ratify it you know they have to approve it and frankly with what you have today maybe they'd rather have us have a loss then do something that's good for the country right because nafta is one of the worst trade deals ever signed in the history of our country you look it around wisconsin but you still see the scarves empty buildings you up to new england you go to ohio you go to different places nafta was a disaster and what we had the one thing i wanted more than anything else i want to make it almost impossible for a company to leave wisconsin and leave other states and go to mexico and go to other places but go to mexico fire it's work open a new plant in mexico hire other workers and sell the equipment into the united states i don't want that and we're not gonna do it it makes it virtually not economically viable that's what i want so it's gonna be great i hope we can get congress to get it approved quickly because it's going to be fantastic for everybody in this room and especially manufacturers and farmers and people aren't going to be firing people and moving their plants to other countries   remember that spell we were going through before i was a politician remember can you believe i'm a politician i can't even politician but remember that spell where everybody was just leaving the country and going into mexico canada mexico canada and canada has been taking big advantage of your agricultural products you know that you know canada we love to soho canada let's say no canada we love the song but i came up here a year ago and i was with farmers and they were selling specialty milk now you're getting killed for years two hundred and ninety seven percent tariff that means you can't sell it that's essentially putting up a barrier so all of those things are taken care of in this new deal and you're gonna be opened up it's gonna be good for everybody it's gonna be good for everybody and if they didn't approve i would have just put tariffs on the cars i would have done that i didn't want to do that i didn't want to do but i said if that's not gonna happen we're putting tariffs on the cars and frankly we'll make more money but the farmers wouldn't be helped so much but you watch the company grow and prosper as you starve that's no good right so we like it and it's good actually it's good for canada it's good for mexico it's good for us we gotta get congress to improve it so put a lot of pressure on these geniuses we have over here that's gonna be a great trade deal and we're very close to making a deal with china but who knows i always say who knows cuz you would have those the deal is either gonna be a great deal has to be i told president she's a friend of mine i said listen this can't be like a good deal for moe this has to be a deal cos we have been losing to china for many years five hundred billion dollars a year we have rebuilt china we've given them so much more think of it and that's cash you know they can say it's surplus they can say it's deficit call it whatever we were losing cash we're giving them five hundred to help can you do it and as prime minister robby said to me today said nobody's ever talked to me this way  he said it friendlies a friend of mine but he said nobody from this country no president has ever sent this you know that nobody ever even talked about it will lose 75 for big in a year japan as an example sells us their cars the cars coming no tax they don't take our cars other than that it's a very fair to you so the cars come in two centuries two and a half percent but essentially it's no tax or agriculture they don't want it we want to sell the agriculture so they sell cars we sell practically nothing that's how we have these massive imbalances with so many countries now china is the big because with china it's at least three hundred and seventy five billion dollars here deficit honestly in all fairness to obama this was him but this was before obama a long time before obama this has been going on for a long time and all i'm telling you is if we don't make it deal we're gonna do even better okay we have all the cards don't forget we're the piggy bank that everybody's robbing whether we're the ones with the piggy bank that everybody is stealing from and robbing and taking advantage of but no matter how hard they try to stop us they can't because our love for america will always be stronger than a corrupt thirst for power this i don't i tell you what you know people say oh he wants to take over the country he wants to extend they don't believe i'm leaving in six years he wants to extend he wants to have presidency for life these are sick people i promise at the end of six years they'll be very happy but you're gonna be left with the strongest country you've ever had  all right usa usa and that's right and that's what this fight is all about we're taking on the failed political establishment and restoring government of by and for the people it's the people you're the people you are there and if you look at what's happened with the scum that's leaving the very top of government people that others used to say oh that's one then dirty these were dirty cops these were dirty players you take a look at what's going on there's 21 of them already and i'm not even doing they're just leaving because they got caught like nobody ever got caught and in the truest sense of the word what we are doing now is draining the swamp that's true  i mean we're draining the swamp but are we having a good time and look at all those beautiful red hats and some white rocks   look at that those are that's a lot of red hatsan but you do have the white ones too right and yet the black ones to have a lot of them you have a lot of different eyes but let me just say so we have to make a decision you want to make it tonight so we're doing great the country is doing great we're rebuilding our military we're doing so many things listen so we have a decision to make we may have the greatest theme in the history of politics it's called make america great is go make a country  it's called maggot country you know i didn't hear that term until that third-rate actor in chicago went out and he said i was beaten up by maggot country can you believe now that's a hate crime right he said he was beaten up by maggot country turned out to be a total lie but think of it mega make america great again and by the way i have to tell you that case in chicago is a disgrace to our nation  so so we have a decision now if this weren't the greatest thing i really believe but it's been said but make america great again ronald reagan you seldom let's make america great close but not the same let's too complicated doesn't work but ronald reagan was good he said let's bake but he didn't use it who use it a little bit we seriously used it right maca and maca we got for free cuz my whole deal was make america great again all of a sudden people to say going hashtag mag guy but we have a choice to make it a decision to me so very shortly we're gonna say you see what we did with our vets we have choice we have accountability where you can fire we have a lot of things okay we've done so much our military is like gonna be very soon in great shape we took a hundred percent of the caliphate in syria everyone said oh you're never gonna bid and by the way by the way and when some whack-job that picks up something over the internet goes out and blows up a store and people get killed i understand that happens i understand because these people are sick they're demented but we nevertheless in terms of a war we took a hundred percent but you're going to have these cells and they're going to do damage and it's a shame and we've got to stop them we've done a great job but we got to be careful we gotta be these are sick horrible human beings if you even call them human beings so we got to be careful and you know what when you see and i say this because we have a massive televisions do you ever see so many cameras if somebody else were here you'd have about like none just like the academy awards used to be before they started hitting us and their ratings started falling like a rock  so we have a choice the man ready so make america great again the problem is we've made america great versu we're gonna have a couple of things to do we should have had health care but one man decided to vote against us at the last moment even though he campaigned for eight years repeal and replace but that's okay that's okay because we're coming up

      "president for leading now she doesn't get it she doesn't get she doesn't understand me after all these years she's becoming too popular i'm jealous sara you're fired  she was wondering what was

lot they've been through a lot of phony stuff the witch hunts they've been through a lot so we're delighted to be joined tonight by many incredible wisconsin republican leaders a really great friend of mine a man who is really the focus of what's going on in so much of washington very tough guy very strong guy i call him wisconsin tough and i don't even know if you know it and i don't know if you appreciate it but i'm telling you he's really good ron johnson  thank you running a great job he's doing a big job now i can tell you that he's working on some things that are very important and members of congress bryan style bryan thank you brian  glenn grothman   this guy every time i introduce him you know i love champions i don't care if it's in sports just like champions so he's your tree climbing champion you know hunter for five years and that's eddie's he'd go up and come down he said the hard part was coming down because you'd get killed if you missed but for five years he was the champion the world champion five years and he's with us tonight and i'll tell he's our champion he fights so hard he's working on a reciprocal trade bill so if somebody charges us a tariff of a hundred percent or fifty percent or 25 percent we say thank you very much we're going to have a reciprocal tax of twenty five  what could be wrong with that and he's leading the charge and he's got tremendous enthusiasm but he's a great guy and he is a great champion shawn and his wife by the way is better than shonda  and another great friend of mine somebody that's been so effective mike gallagher mike thanks mike  and thanks also to was council house majority leader jim steiner key thanks yeah great wisconsin senate president roger roth senate majority leader scott fitzgerald thank you  these are great people they've done so much for us that we have other leaders in the room but we all know who they are they've been incredible the republican party's been incredible after just the first two years time america is winning again and america is respected again all over the world no more games all over the world  since the election we've created more than 6 million new jobs nobody would have believed that if i said this when i came here often i came here often remember i came and they didn't like certain people that were with me they booed the hell out of those people but they liked me that's all that mattered if i would have said 6 million jobs were going to create by this time two and a half years can you believe how time flies two and a half years already i said the other night i remember first night standing in my bedroom i should say our bedroom with our great first lady i said did you believe first night i said here we are here we are in the white house and four years sounded so long away and now four years is coming up with two and a half years and no administration has done as much as we have in the first   thank you and by the way yesterday was our first lady's birthday and people love it we're about the same age but if i would have said that we would be in june areas creating six million jobs people would have left 600,000 manufacturing jobs remember president obama said manufacturing jobs a gun you need a wand a magic wand we found the magic wand because they're coming and they're coming fast does it rachel in the state of wisconsin alone we have created 23,000 brand new manufacturing and construction jobs a record  and after years and years of declining wages wages are rising for the first time in 21 years and you know what's nice because i have a couple of friends here they're pretty wealthy people very successful people and you know what the hell with them i don't care i care about everybody you know what i love you know what i love i love the fact that wages are rising fastest for the lowest income americans  you know when they say it hasn't trickled down the most success percentage-wise the most successful are the lowest income americans there's something great about that and people that are now able to go out you know we got veterans choice we also have employment choice because you never had a chance you had to stay in a job that you hate it or you couldn't get a job now you can go out you have seven alternatives you get a job that you love and you get much higher salaries it's great  and you've heard me say this a hundred times but i say it again and i'll keep saying the unemployment rates from african-americans hispanic americans and asian americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country  and remember this if i make any mistake if i'm off by just a little tiny bit those people back there will be headlines so i have to be very careful fake news they're fake they are fake they are fakers  i'll tell you you know what sucks their ratings suck because we have cut 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the federal register that's an all-time record it's never happened before we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in our nation's history and you know something that is very important to me and very important to because of you to keep family farms ranches and small businesses together in the family when you pass on and go to heaven so you can look down at these great children and if you don't like your children don't listen to probably a couple of you out there to say you know i don't like the kid i'm not leaving on my damn far anybody in here like that raise you but on the assumption that you love you kids and you love your family and you want to leave the farm you remember what used to happen the estate tax was 45 50 55 percent they had to go out and borrow money and sometimes the land is worth more than the income and they couldn't do it and the banks end up and the banks fight them and that's not what they do for living the kids and they lose the farm they lose the ranch they lose the small business right well we have eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax or all of those zero that's a good one after decades of kilometers straight deals that stripped away our wealth literally stripped away this country's wealth and our jobs and so many other things took away our dignity when great companies would leave the united states for another country because of stupid taxes because of stupid regulations because frankly in some cases and the unions are gonna work on this i tell them you got to work on this you got to have a little flexibility because there are other choices but now the choices are going to be other states they're going to be competition but you know what now america fought back and all of these companies are coming back into our nation again they want to be where the action is and the era of economic surrender is over that's what we did we would like remember that i used to do when i was a civilian when i had no idea i was gonna be running for president right i had no idea i used to say what the hell is going on in michigan they gave me an award six years seven years ago i had no idea it was the man of the year in michigan i went to michigan i said do you people know what's happening you're losing all your car companies they're all leaving they're going to mexico canada they leave they're leaving they're going to china do you know what the hell is and this was before i was thinking about running for office but i've been saying it for 20 years and now we've stopped it those companies are wrong coming back  when the wisconsin timber industry was threatened my administration took immediate action we imposed tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products and saved countless timber jobs all across this great state and you know that you know that job big difference right they were losing you're losing a lot of jobs and they were taking the timber from other states and other countries nope not anymore we're doing good before i took office one of the gravest threats to the future of american manufacturing was the previous administration's trans-pacific partnership you think nafta would have been bad this would have made nafta look like a good deal the tpp would have decimated us manufacturing and gutted america's auto industry it would have gotten the industry and they were dying to do this crazy deal i also ended up another one you know the great paris accords how is paris doing lately how's paris how's paris to send to all the money to countries that the people never heard of and raised their taxes i ended that one too i thought i was going to take a lot of heat on that one saved a lot of money saved a lot of jobs saved a lot of it they said you know when i end this paris accord i'm gonna take heed i didn't even take heed mike people understood it it was a ripoff it didn't allow us to use our wealth would have stolen our jobs but just take a look at what's happening to other places where they're trying to do it and we had something we would have never ever been able to adhere to the rules that were so strict on us you know china can sign rules they're not going to be sued by greenpeace if greenpeace goes to china that's the end of greenpeace you'll never see him so china doesn't care of the violate greenpeace and some of these other wonderful environmental groups but the united states gets sued and we adhere to these things it's a little bit different we would have lost our ass on that deal that would have been a terrible deal and that's why i was willing to take the heat but there was going i'm still waiting i guess at some point they'll bring it up they'll probably bring it up bernie sanders will say what i'll say take a look at paris sort of saturday after there bernie how they doing over there good the yellow vests how they do it i don't think so good and they're great friends of mine but i don't think they're doing so good that's why in one of my first acts as president i withdrew the united states from the one sided job killing disaster known as tpp tpp what a mess that was another one of these deals that were set up for the strict purpose of taking wealth out of the united states for the benefit of those other countries that were in the deal it was a one-sided horror show america will not be taken advantage of any longer  for years we gave foreign nations free and unfettered access to our economy while they constructed massive barriers to american exports we give them you come in take us it's wonderful we want to go there no we don't do that we don't accept your product oh that's wonderful as one example we charge other countries zero tariffs on foreign paper products but when wisconsin paper companies exported abroad they sent their product abroad china charged us big tariffs india charged us big tariffs vietnam charged us massive towers unfair reciprocal trade chong reciprocal trade  look at harley-davidson look at harley does i met with them three years ago one of my first meetings harley davidson i said to the people they're very nice they would tell me tough to do business in certain guys how you doing in india they said oh we don't do any business said they weren't even complaining because for so many years so india charged a hundred percent tariff on a harley davis but when they send their motorcycles and they make them to us we charge em nothing so i called up prime minister modi i said unfair he cut it 50% but i said that's not good enough because look it's 50% to nothing and what we're doing is changing all of that stuff changing rapidly and that goes for military protection also that goes for military protection also where we are getting ripped we're defending the world we're defending wealthy countries that can well afford to pay us but they've been getting this free military or at least massive partial subsidies for so many years it's almost like habit it's more habit than anything else nobody does anything about it but we do there's one country we lose five billion dollars i would say i don't want to embarrass anybody the last thing i want to do is embarrass but they lose we spend five billion dollars a year defending them right so i said to the generals how much do we spend next thing sir we spent five billion dollars very wealthy country i said how much do they pay sure they pay five hundred million dollars i said you mean we lose four and a half billion nails to defend them and they're rich so i called the country right i called the country so we lose forward a half billion for the privilege of defending a country that's very tough on us on trade and so i called i said listen so good now they were to say the shot because they never got a call like this in 25 years i said it's no good we'll lose in four and a half billion dollars it's no good we can't do this anymore this is crazy and he got very upset angry this is not fair i said of course it's fair he said well we'll give you five hundred million more because the budget you see had already been set there's only a month left so you know i said you know what i want more we argued so they paid us more than five hundred million for one phone call it took me one call now i'm not breaking i hate the deal  ron knows one call his first call they've had it in 35 years i don't think they have a had a call one-sided horrible deal so i said it's okay you know i understand your budgets you know you go through a budget next year which now turns out to be in about two weeks i said we're gonna call you for much more you got to pay you gotta pay not fair we're defending you and you rich you know we can defend people they're not rich and they're being horribly treated and human rights and all this that's different these are rich countries but think of it one phone call we pick up five hundred million that's not terrible but now we're gonna pick up a lot more and we have that with many countries look saudi arabia very rich country we defend them we subsidize saudi arabia they have nothing but cash right we subsidize and they buy a lot from us four hundred and fifty billion dollars they bought you know you had people wanting to cut off saudi arabia they bought four hundred and fifty billion dollars i don't want to lose him but the military we subsidize saudi arabia i called the king i like the king i said king we're losing arrest offending you king and you have a lot of money  and he said but why would you be calling me nobody has ever made such a call before i said that's because they were stupid so we're working to deal with so there's so many things so many things i'll tell you what honestly it's easier than collecting a hundred and thirteen dollars and fifty seven cents from a tenant in a bad location in new york city and it's safer too it's easier it's true it's easier okay now for that but it's true so we're getting ripped off and trade we're getting ripped off for military nato i'm all for nato but you know we're paying for almost a hundred percent of defending europe and they're killing her son trade the european union the eu is killing us we lost 181 million dollars that were defending them for peanuts it does it does this make sense to you what i'm saying and in the meantime your taxes go up although they actually because it may have gone down so i guess the international trade commission recently announced that under the us mca american dairy exports to canada are expected to surge by more than 50 percent okay we got to get the deal done ron you got to get that deal you'll get it done got to get it done and my first 100 days in office i traveled to this very state to sign an executive order declaring that we will live by two simple rules by american and higher american right here  but while we are unleashing america's economic read or the new agenda of the democrat party it's not the democratic party it sounds but they were to change their name it's much better but why should i make their name sound good right the democrat party radical left they should change that do call it officially the radical left democrat party would drive our nation into economic and financial ruin very quickly and they will take your guns away too by the way nothing is more dangerous than the democrats crazy immigration agenda we wanted solved we're building the wall by the way we're gonna have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next  you know we can get money for anything they were willing to give me money for every single thing more money that i wanted i said i don't need that much money give me money for the world we're not giving you anything for the wall you know why because politically they don't like it so i went out and did it a different way and we have the money for the wall and we're building the world because their entire party has been taken over by far-left radicals who want to nullify and erase american borders they want open borders they want open borders they want people and they think that's gonna be votes ultimately for them these left-wing extremists don't believe america as the right to enforce our immigration laws or decide who gets to enter and remain in our country not gonna be that way and think of border patrol we apprehend a hundred thousand people a month you know what that is democrats want to allow totally unlimited uncontrolled and unchecked migration all paid for by you the american taxpayer the republican party believes america has not only the right but the absolute duty to control our borders and to enforce our laws  and we believe the immigration system must put the needs of american workers and families first and people can come into our country we need people to come in we have so many companies coming they need workers but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit and we will always support the heroes of ice and border patrol these are great here last month alone 100,000 illegal immigrants arrived at our borders placing a massive strain on communities and schools and hospitals and public resources like nobody's ever seen before now we're sending many of them to sanctuary cities thank you very much they're not too happy about it i'm proud to tell you that was actually my sick idea hey hey what they why did they say we want him i said we'll give him to you thank you they said we don't want yet well wealthy liberals preach open borders they live behind gates and guards they send their families to the best doctors and private schools and while pushing immigration policies that drain the public services every day citizens depend on you and they depend on you i depend on you because we can change our immigration laws i used to say in 45 minutes it's really 15 minutes it's so simple but we need democrats to vote on it otherwise we can't change them and they don't want because number one they don't want to give us a victory we're gonna take it anyway we're gonna take the victory but they don't want to give us something on that issue and number two they don't mind open borders and obviously open borders bring tremendous crime they don't mind crime if you can believe the border crisis is also driving and very strongly the drug crisis the biggest crisis we have drugs its people and it's drugs and it's traffickers cartels traffic huge quantities of heroin meth cocaine and fentanyl across our southern border drugs that claimed the lives of 80 90 and maybe even a hundred thousand people a year and ruin the lives and the families of so many more to confront the border crisis i declared a national emergency the good news is everybody  now everybody's they look at those caravans we just had a caravan for 20,000 people and we told mexico i said listen if you let those people come through your country we're gonna close the damn border we'll close it i don't  they got to bring them back i got to bring them back you mainly they got to bring them back the flood of illegal migration is the direct consequence of democrat backed policies that prevent border violators from being promptly returned home they're allowed to stay in our country catch and release they're allowed you catch them and then you have to release them in a sprays congress has to fix these horrible immigration laws we have to end human smuggling stop human trafficking shut down sanctuary deport criminal element and replace visa lotteries and chain migration with immigration systems based on skill and talent and merit  ron johnson's gonna do it ron congratulations stand up run will you get that done for me please no get it done for wisconsin eldo on issue after issue the democrat party has never been further outside the american-made ship i mean it's crazy what's going on with them oh do i look forward to running against them they are pushing a one hundred trillion dollar government takeover of the us economy known as the green new deal we're gonna rip down every single building in manhattan and build a new building in this place they've introduced a total federal takeover of us health care that would abolish the private health insurance of 180 million americans many of you are in this room right now and they are aggressively pushing extreme late term abortion allowing children to be ripped from their mothers right up until the moment of birth and just this week your democrat governor by the way we have scott walker's here great government he did a great job he's a great governor got a big future but you're democrat governor here in wisconsin shockingly stated that he will veto legislation that protects wisconsin babies born born allah the baby is born the mother meets with the doctor they take care of the baby they wrapped the baby beautifully and then the doctor and the mother determined whether or not they will execute the baby i don't credible no it's incredible until this crazy man in virginia said it nobody even thought of that right they didn't would even think of them yeah late term but this is where the baby is actually born and came out it's there it's wrapped that's so two protectors in life i called on congress to immediately pass legislation prohibiting the extreme late term abortion so democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion hoaxes and delusions the republican party is the party for all americans that's what it is and common sense with a party of common sense with the party of the american worker the american family the american dream with the party of the second amendment and its protection  and everyday we are making good on the motto promises made promises kept last month i signed an executive order with charlie where are you joe where's charlie where is the man he's like 14 years old i can't believe 25 can you believe this guys what a job in honor of him he worked so hard and for those of you who think that youth is a door to our side just look at this audience tonight look at what charlie with me amazed i was watching the other night the nfl draft can you believe it and it was the second draft choice and he gets out mosa and he gets out real he's gonna be a great player from ohio state and he's a mag affair he loves trump he loves backing you got a lot of young people out there you want to know the truth i actually think we have more than they do who knows but i think we have more than they do he's gonna have a great career last month i signed an executive order to defend free speech on college campus and if they don't give free speech they lose billions and billions of dollars in that's okay and we've launched a historic initiative to reduce the price of prescription drugs so important last year prescription drug prices went down for the first time in 51 years okay  it's gonna go down a lot for got it down i was a big deal not by much but you know it's always gone up a lot 18% 6% 9% it went down and it's gonna step going down cuz all of these very complex things that we're doing is starting to kick in we're gonna get them down and maybe on that one we're going to work with the democrats to be honest because they want to get it down too and we'll see if we can put it all together but prescription drugs look it's a rigged system okay if i told you how crazy it is the web it's a web you need 193 iq to even understand this web of geniuses they put this thing to lower a drug price it as 19 effects here and 27 we got it down and we're getting it down further we have the smartest people the best people in that world working on it and we might be able to get democrat support we're vastly expanding affordable alternatives to obamacare we repealed obamacare's unfair and very unpopular individual mandate where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having health insurance that was very bad and will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions the republicans are always going to protect pre-existing conditions we're unleashing american energy and getting washington bureaucrats off the backs of hunters fishers farmers and everyone who enjoys our great outdoors and we've committed to providing i think you'll like this and ron and those great congressman the job in this room are working hard on it we're very close three hundred million dollars for the great lakes restoration initiative and we're building the new su locks to protect jobs and commerce throughout the entire midwest sue locks and i'm pleased to report that earlier this month interlake steamship company announced plans to build the first great lakes freighter in 35 years just north of here in sturgeon bay how did you know 35 years and that just means more jobs more jobs more jobs to keep america safe we are rebuilding america's mighty mite we are rebuilding our military like never before in the history  that includes brand-new combat ships from marinette and more than 6,000 brand-new armored vehicles from oshkosh  and we're boldly defending american and dressed just yesterday i announced that my administration is unsigned the un arms trade treaty we run signing we're pulling it back out of the united nations we're pulling it back out of congress all of you second amendment people you know  because we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on america's freedom we're not gonna allow that was a president obama disaster i also went through the united states from the absolutely horrible one-sided iran nuclear deal what an impact that's had you know when i first became president the first week i met with our great military people and we went over problems and one of the biggest problems was were and they were all over iran was all over the place they were over i've never seen anything like it 14 different conflict zones yemen syria all over and small battles i said what do you do with these people i withdrew from that horrible deal where they paid 150 billion to iran they paid 1.8 billion in cash probably for hostage by the way i got 22 hostages out  and the other day our great hostage negotiator made the statement that trump is the greatest hostage negotiator this country's ever had so you know what so i put it out i put it out why not you know a lot of times if you're not going to brag about it nobody else is you might as well do it so our ambassador made the set and the press picked it up and they were going after me it's not true it's not true and then he called them and he said no it is true and instead of saying it's true they stopped talking about fake news i recognized israel's capital and opened the american embassy in jerusalem and i would have opened in 25 years but i said to our great ambassador david freeman one of the most successful lawyers in new york he became ambassador to israel i said david they want to spend 1.1 billion dollars we could do it cheaper they want to buy this piece of land in jerusalem top dollar i said david what can we do and he called me back he said sir we have a piece of land that's much better and on that piece of land we have an old building and we're not using the building very much and we can renovate the building for $400,000 and we'll have a beautiful embassy in a better location and we can have it done and sir we can have it done in four months instead of 25 years so here's your alternative a building at a great location in four months for $400,000 or a building that will probably never get built but let's say 20 years for 1.1 billion today meaning three four billion dollars in a lousy location that won't be as good as what we built and it's the first time i've had ever done this he said four hundred thousand i said david it's too cheap we have to make it it's true i said make it five hundred thousand and it's open we opened it like almost a year ago and you know in new york i have a friend he's a very successful guy and he's very proud of his office because he used to thing called jerusalem stone this is stone from jerusalem it's one of the most expensive she considers it a treasure and every time i go and it's just oh look at my beautiful stone is from jerusalem so we're building a building in jerusalem i said david do me a favor by jerusalem stone you right there we got it so cheap you wouldn't believe and the whole damn building is made practically of jerusalem stone it's beautiful so we got it open in four months instead of twenty or twenty-five years and we saved at least 1.1 billion and it's a great embassy right now it's a great great thing that's great and just weeks ago i announced that the united states will recognize he's really sovereignty over the golan heights so that's been under consideration for 52 years for 52 years they told me they've been studying if they've had summons many many meetings summits people coming from all over the world talking about the golan heights and then they'd leave this is very important strategically for victory heights you're a pi very important 52 years ago it started and i did it like quickly done it's all done and we also recognized the legitimate government of venezuela and we strongly condemned the socialist brutality of the maduro regime and you see what socialism does that was one of the wealthiest countries in the world now it's one of the poorest and to those who would try to impose socialism in our country we see nothing but trouble we see nothing but poverty and we will say again tonight that america will never be a socialist country ever   great what is crowd has a lot of it is a hell of a crowd saturday night we're having a good time and you know why we're having a good time because we are talking about a subject that we love the united states of america's first each of us in this arena is united by the same timeless values we believe in the american constitution and we believe in the rule of law we
