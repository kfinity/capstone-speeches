Three reports on THIS submission.  All bogus.  

On THIS submission.

[So folks...there is me contacting the admins to let them know that y'all are trying to waste moderator time by filing bogus reports on a submission calling for harmony.](https://imgur.com/a/daYB1Wc)

Also, I'm seeing a lot of handwringing by the left here that everyone's not just saying, ""Yes"" to this post and some are expressing frustration with trying to deal with the left.

So...on this my cakeday...have a sampling of some of the comments you DID not see on this post...

And don't forget to thank your mods!!!

1,i1j8x7,This deserves bipartisan support
2,i1j8x7,Proud to have joined this sub when I see posts like this :)
3,i1j8x7,"A reminder that we are all Americans, and when we turn our eyes and ears away from the bipartisanship we can turn them back to the constitution and the freedoms that we have and what makes us Americans."
4,i1j8x7,I dig
5,i1j8x7,Thanks! From a democrat. I don‚Äôt see this content in my other subs.
6,i1j8x7,People who truly love this country and it‚Äôs values find they have more in common then not. There is a big difference between extremism on both ends and a few disagreements on the role government plays in society.
7,i1j8x7,"Hard to have a conversation when the other person calls you privileged, racist, a bigot etc"
8,i1j8x7,yup...we can't help people if we can't talk to them. The reason lots of people are democrats is because they see democrats as the party that helps people. Even if this is wrong wanting to help people isn't.
9,i1j8x7,I do my best to assume all questions are in good faith... To a point.
10,i1j8x7,"Amen.  First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
11,i1j8x7,This so much. Unity. America is strong enough to solve any problem on the planet. Diversity is a strength all on its own. Divisiveness is not.
12,i1j8x7,"Thank you!...I‚Äôve got a conservative upbringing with a liberal education and find these political times so damn toxic and stressful.  I love my country and all my people.  

I‚Äôll add another reminder for the level headed folks...it is way more satisfying to put in the effort to have an open minded discussion, to empathize with, and to learn from someone else than it will ever be to have a hate-filled closed-minded battle of wits."
13,i1j8x7,This is the way
14,i1j8x7,Must respect
15,i1j8x7,"as a lib, thank you for this"
16,i1j8x7,Best post I've seen on this page.
17,i1j8x7,"‚ÄúOwning the libs by eating Goya won‚Äôt do anything‚Äù

23,i1j8x7,Hell yeah!
24,i1j8x7,"Amen, chief. Where else did you put this? I‚Äôd love to see how the other side reacts to this."
25,i1j8x7,It's an ideal that is nearly extinct but we can rebuild it...better... stronger...faster!
26,i1j8x7,What a breath of fresh air!
27,i1j8x7,Respect from a dem
28,i1j8x7,"Agreed, in my discussions I am 99% of the time extremely civil I cannot say it is for the other side but when I have a civil discussion it is great"
29,i1j8x7,kinda hard when the other side instantly assumes us as racist and sexist tho...
30,i1j8x7,"Thanks from an independent with Republican leanings (2016) turned staunch democrat (2016-present). 

The ability to ‚Äúreach across the aisle‚Äù to work together is everything imo."
31,i1j8x7,"We let honest debate stand. That said, leftists, if you troll we will ban."
32,i1j8x7,"As a Socialist from Portland I am pretty open to conversation. If anybody ever wants to talk, dm me."
33,i1j8x7,"This country needs to renew dialogue with each other. I am afraid this has largely died out when McCain and Lewis died, Ryan stepped down. But posts like this give me hope that it will return. To a more perfect Union, always."
34,i1j8x7,"Yeah, but we need to keep goya alive and not let the company die just becasue some liberals whined on twitter"
35,i1j8x7,another reminder: democrats can vote republican and republicans can vote democrat! :0
36,i1j8x7,"Whoa whoa. That reasonable thought was little uncalled for, don‚Äôt you think?"
37,i1j8x7,I've yet to meet a biden supporter in the wild.

39,i1j8x7,I‚Äôll eat GOYA while having my discussion
40,i1j8x7,"This was a great post to read first thing in the morning. My parents and grandparents were able to sit around and talk politics. Voices raised, but everyone listened to each other without the insults. I suppose it's nastier on social media because we have the anonymity shroud. Imagine how many posts would disappear if our names and addresses were attached to them."
41,i1j8x7,"As a person right smack dab in the middle, I agree! So tired of being labeled one or the other every time I question one of their ideas."
42,i1j8x7,At least we can all agree that bacon is good for your health
43,i1j8x7,"Now will you post the same thing in a liberal subreddit? Don't masquerade, be about it."
44,i1j8x7,So many people are assholes about politics. It sucks.
45,i1j8x7,"I can't remember which, but one of the early federalist papers addresses this problem. Wise words."
46,i1j8x7,"Wait, this goes against the narrative.

On this topic, ‚ÄúHate Inc.‚Äù by Matt Taibbi goes in depth about how we got to this point."
47,i1j8x7,Just because someone has different beliefs/opinions doesn‚Äôt mean that they are dumb.
48,i1j8x7,Well said!!
49,i1j8x7,"Hell yeah, quality post. üëçüèæ"
50,i1j8x7,YESSS!
51,i1j8x7,I‚Äôll second that - HERE HERE
52,i1j8x7,RECLAIMING MY TIME
53,i1j8x7,Not a rep. I support this 100p
54,i1j8x7,Bro he‚Äôs saying what were thinking
55,i1j8x7,"Also... 

... nice?"
56,i1j8x7,"My mom‚Äôs friend since childhood is a democrat, it‚Äôs more than possible."
57,i1j8x7,God bless
58,i1j8x7,Thank you. The new talking point is All whites are bad. And all police are bad.
59,i1j8x7,"As a democrat, I agree with this wholeheartedly. We need unity from both sides."
60,i1j8x7,"This SHOULD be posted in r/politics. 

Who really needs to calm it down and have a real conversation. Last time I check it wasnt Republicans and conservatives rioting, murdering cops, and trying to fundamentally change our way of life."
61,i1j8x7,Yes
62,i1j8x7,This is what we need right now
63,i1j8x7,This is exactly what needs to be realized by every person on the planet. This whole letting social media and the news tell us what we‚Äôre supposed to be pissed about and who we‚Äôre supposed to dislike needs to end.
64,i1j8x7,You deserve all those awards and more
65,i1j8x7,"I mean, still eat Goya to own the libs. But also do the other stuff."
66,i1j8x7,"Thank you! I personally don't care what party anyone ""belongs"" to. Just don't be a dick. I think years of people being told to not talk about politics is why it is so hard to do so now a days. Why does it always have to come to name calling and random talking points that don't take the conversation anywhere but in circles?"
67,i1j8x7,"There are good people who are Democrats. But they still side with those who seek to oppress us by removing our right to speak, our right to protest, and our right to worship. So it doesn't matter if they are good inside. All that matters is the utility of their actions.

Funny how I never see you people saying this to the liberals on this site, who definitely need to hear it."
68,i1j8x7,Facts
69,i1j8x7,This is exactly the energy I want to see from *both* parties!
70,i1j8x7,I do like wearing my Goya shirt out though
71,i1j8x7,Raise a glass to freedom!
72,i1j8x7,"As a democrat, its very easy to get the idea that all republicans are hateful or blissfully ignorant, and being on this site doesn‚Äôt really help, but this post alone for some reason just reminded me that, not everything‚Äôs black and white, i may not understand the motives but im sure that there are republicans that just want the best for people and that all the nonsense i see is just a vocal minority and doesn‚Äôt represent the whole party

Also, whats goya? Cant say ive heard of it"
73,i1j8x7,I agree with all of this except the Goya part. If they try to tear down an American company because muh feelz then we should try to support that‚Äôs business
74,i1j8x7,This is so refreshing to read
75,i1j8x7,"Also, don't assume bad intentions. You'll be amazed at how receptive people are to meaningful constructive conversations, when you give people the benefit of the doubt."
76,i1j8x7,"You'd never ever see a post like this on r/democrats or any liberal sub. Even commenting this will just get insults fired at you and tons of downvotes.

I love conservatives lol."
77,i1j8x7,"Eh. Sure but there are far more democrats acting out right now than republicans. No party is perfect but right now the left are LOST.

But you‚Äôre right we should always strive to uphold what you said."
78,i1j8x7,"Nah, I like owning the libs with my Goya beans and Red Bull. The only problem is my butthole gets its revenge soon enough."
79,i1j8x7,"Problem is, Democrats won‚Äôt have a conversation anymore."
80,i1j8x7,Have you ever tried having a conversation with a liberal?   Good luck with that
81,i1j8x7,"If the right didn't constantly disregard systemic racism and constantly throw hate at gay and especially trans people, we wouldn't be nearly as divided as we currently are.  


I'm a hardcore progressive lefty but a lot of my friends are the opposite. I'll never personally attack someone for claiming to be right leaning. But if we talk longer and I find out you're a bigot, goodbye  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
82,i1j8x7,"I'm more of a centrist and don't really like either party, but this one post gave me a more favorable impression of Republicans. It seems like most people on the left are too busy being woke SJWs and bashing anyone who doesn't agree to try to seek any common ground or unity."
83,i1j8x7,"Wow imagine someone being capable of being somewhere in the middle whether it‚Äôs middle left or middle right. Worlds quite unbelievable, either you are on their side or you are a racist. What happened to good ole america where you vote for who you vote for and if ya lose you comeback and try again 4 years later."
84,i1j8x7,Agreed except libs never act this way. Time to stop taking the high ground and fight fire with fire.  These are not reasonable people we‚Äôre dealing with.
85,i1j8x7,Conversations are meaningless unless they‚Äôre going to go vote for Trump
86,i1j8x7,People used to be capable of this.
87,i1j8x7,Amen
88,i1j8x7,"Kinda lost me at the Goya part

Maybe if Democrats didn‚Äôt boycott every company that has any perceptible connection to Trump and maybe the rest of us wouldn‚Äôt have to take active counterbalance measures."
89,i1j8x7,Was this done on pornhub notes section or something lol
90,i1j8x7,"Exactly. It‚Äôs about the policies not the person, that‚Äôs why Trump will win this November."
91,i1j8x7,"This is exactly why I come here.

&#x200B;

 /u/zachbaker710 you have now, HI!

I won't say I love everything about him but honestly there's nothing about him that's worse than T.

The division is worse than I've ever seen it, it's why I come here, I don't get it. I mean sure we all get frustrated, and yeah sometimes it's fun to poke a little fun now and then. But we have people on both sides of this debate that have begun going out and shooting each other.

Ya gotta draw a line somewhere and that was mine for sure. I don't agree with trump, mostly because I think he's ill-educated and mostly illiterate, as well as intentionally destructive. I don't think he cares any more about his position than what it can do for him. I certainly don't think he is mentally stable enough to lead this country.

Had it been anyone other than hillary, which many many people that had never voted before came out for the first time solely to vote against her then I think he would have lost. He got lucky and got the one challenger he could beat.

I don't think he can beat ole fuzzy joe, who yes, will happily take what the offices gives him as well, I just don't think it's his **only** purpose, like Trumps.

Disclaimer: I am not trolling, I am serious about conversation, if you have nothing to say but strawmen arguments about how joe can't read a teleprompter don't bother, yes all politicians are like this in some way or another, let's have productive conversation that's not rehashing things we all know all politicians are likely guilty of."
92,i1j8x7,Wrong. Everyone is bad. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
93,i1j8x7,"...yea, we tried that. Didn‚Äôt work."
94,i1j8x7,"I can‚Äôt tell you how many people say they‚Äôre surprised when they find out I‚Äôm republican because I listen first and then try to reason... I‚Äôve had people scream at me when they find out I‚Äôm a republican and don‚Äôt think Trump is the antichrist, just to apologize later because I don‚Äôt take the bait."
95,i1j8x7,"Once Democrats across the board approved riots, killing whites, the end of society in favor of communism, putting illegals over citizens and the murder of children before and after birth; I'd say there stopped being good Democrats."
96,i1j8x7,"Sure thing. You can say it was race, but it isn‚Äôt evidence of it. Evidence of his not liking I‚Äôm his politics yes. 

Actually, refusing Section 8 isn‚Äôt racist. It‚Äôs good business sense. You then have to address why at the same time he was helping black business owners and organizations. 

Again, they were found not guilty, the guilty was vacated, but their own statements, even before the police knew of the crime indicates they did it. 

Besides, why would it be wrong for Trump to say that a violent gang rape shouldn‚Äôt result in the DP? 

Again, that‚Äôs how they live in Sub-Sahara Africa. That said, there is zero proof he said it, just anonymous sources. So it doesn‚Äôt make him a racist when Jesse Jackson literally says the opposite. 

No, they can exist the military and then request it through the VA. 

Again the suicide rate is extremely high:

https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/suicidality-transgender-adults/

So if being denied to serve increased suicide rate m, wouldn‚Äôt that hold true to straights and regular LGB too?

I did try, but you could literally have God Almighty crack the sky open and tell you that he isn‚Äôt racist and you‚Äôd still say he was wrong. 

You ignored 2 prominent black men saying Trump isn‚Äôt a racist And hold on to a few statement and ignored he was the first to let blacks into the country club. 

This is going no where. You‚Äôre welcome to stay and debate though, unlike r/Democrats we allow thoughtful dissent."
97,i1j8x7,I like this guy
98,i1j8x7,But there is no such thing as a good communist.
99,i1j8x7,Yeah but try posting this on a liberal/democratic subreddit
100,i1j8x7,"As a RVAT, I get a lot of hate, but hating someone based on their political opinions is incredibly stupid"
101,i1j8x7,"The problem is that their party is, at best, allowing the appearance that they‚Äôre going to completely tear this country down because of how evil it is. The day top democrats start renouncing this behavior will be the day they can come to the big people table to talk."
102,i1j8x7,The left have gone off the deep end with their socialism. This country is going to hell in a handbasket.
103,i1j8x7,I‚Äôm pretty sure Republicans aren‚Äôt the ones who need to hear this. I highly doubt this would last five seconds on R Politics.
104,i1j8x7,"I like this. A lot. 

I remember back in 2016, before the election, I would just make fun of Trump without actually listening to anything he said. 

Nobody I knew was outwardly Republican and I just stereotyped them to all be assholes, based on what I‚Äôd see on TV. I found out my neighbor who was super nice was a big Trump supporter and it made me think....maybe I should actually hear what Trump has to say. If someone I respect supports him, I shouldn‚Äôt just dismiss him. 

So, I watched the debates and I actually agreed a lot with what Trump said..... I actually ended up voting for him!

If more people on both sides took the time to understand where the other side was coming from, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôd be so much division. 

The people on the far right or far left tend to be the ones who broadcast their opinions everywhere on social media, so people tend to assume the other side is so extreme...it‚Äôs crazy how divisive everything has become....I really hope things can change. Lately, it feels like all political discussion is insults to the other side with no productive dialogue occurring"
105,i1j8x7,It makes me really happy to see the top post in this subreddit is so reasonable and accepting. Proud of you guys.
106,i1j8x7,Just saying you probably won't see that on r/Democrats
107,i1j8x7,Most democrats I‚Äôve met are bad ones. However some of my family close friends are Democrats   and I won‚Äôt say they‚Äôre ‚Äúgood‚Äù democrats but they agree on some political things that make us so heated.
108,i1j8x7,Lol
109,i1j8x7,"lol I got banned from commenting in r/democrats just because I participated in this subreddit as well, There party is full of clowns."
110,i1j8x7,I support
111,i1j8x7,I'm a Trump supporters and my wife is a life long Democrat.  every time I try to bring up something that the far left is doing  she gets mad and won't hear me out.  Frankly she doesn't have a clue what is going on and doesn't know that the left is destroying our country.  all she knows is that she hates Trump
112,i1j8x7,"I beg to differ, owning the libs by eating Goya will do something. It‚Äôll make me not hungry for 4 hours."
113,i1j8x7,"But I love Goya food, wet burrito baby!"
114,i1j8x7,"Sort by controversial and you‚Äôll see a crazy number of people who just completely ignore the point this very well made post is. It‚Äôs hard to find any subs on reddit that lean even slightly to the right without becoming very far right, borderline worshipping trump like t_d, but this is somewhat refreshing to see. Even as someone quite left, it might be worth my time to look at a couple of posts here to try and see a different point of view."
115,i1j8x7,"I agree, but it won‚Äôt happen"
116,i1j8x7,"As a Dem, thanks."
117,i1j8x7,All the left does is slander 24/7. It's so childish. You'll never see anything like this on a democratic sub.
118,i1j8x7,The toxicity of most of the comments in this thread makes this post seem like an ironic joke
119,i1j8x7,"Nah, owning the libs is fun.  Especially after their behavior over the last 4 years"
120,i1j8x7,Its ok to call a spade a spade. If you support Bernie then you support communism so its ok to call them commies.
121,i1j8x7,Sadly you will never see liberals say this or act the same. Its honestly wasted effort
122,i1j8x7,This would get downvoted into oblivion on r/politics.
123,i1j8x7,This post was made by a democrat who patrols republican subreddits and won't post the same thing in a liberal subreddit.
124,i1j8x7,Are you guys feeling OK? Do I need to call someone for help?
125,i1j8x7,"but democrats ARE bad thinkers.  thats par for the course lol.  its the only way theyre where they are.  some/many defintely are malicious.  but yeah, some are ok.

Republicans better thinkers, and some are bad, like john mccain apparently was (but he was smart in a devious way at the end)

but remember: youll almost never catch a democrat saying something like the above. which says alot (conservatives and R‚Äôs are more generous in that way).  republicans lose because we fall back on this, ‚Äúwell, we are all kind of ok‚Äù mentality, while the dems never stop spitting fire at us.

also, there is no republican equivent of antifa/blm/mob violence, which says alot about the quality of the two groups overall (r‚Äôs and d‚Äôs).

its a truism that there are good ppl anywhere, and bad ppl anywhere, but what that reduction leaves out is that there are WAY more bad on the left, and WAY more good on the right. 

that simplistic reduction is a truism but essentially amounts to a false equivalency.

humility is a good thing, we dont want to think we‚Äôre perfect, but so is perspective, and one of our imperfections is rationalizing away the maliciousness of the d‚Äôs too often."
126,i1j8x7,"- Republicans don't wear masks 

- Republicans are racist

- Republicans are sexist

- All Republicans are stupid redneck trump supporters

- All republicans are brainwashed 

Some of the things Democrats say about Republicans, it's funny how it's completely unacceptable to ""assume someone's gender,"" but it's completely ok to assume all Republicans are rednecks, racist, sexist, and anti-mask."
127,i1j8x7,[removed]
128,i1j8x7,"The problem lies in our 2 party system and how is been turned into a sports league of my team versus yours. 

That's what they want, to keep us divided. Hell even Russia is stirring shit up between us on Facebook, but I digress.

We need a multiparty system with ranked voting. That'll lead to more specialized parties and help renew the ""marketplace of ideas."" It'll also hopefully curb this sports team mentality."
129,i1j8x7,That‚Äôs all fine and dandy if the parties and political beliefs were on an equal playing field. They‚Äôre not. Whole system leans left.
130,i1j8x7,"Not possible to have a conversation with the left. They are completely and totally unprepared for conversation. And it's the press' fault. 

The press has spent so much time feeding the left fake news, they know to many things that aren't true. The press spends so much time coddling the left, they have no idea how to debate, persuade, or convince. The end result is the left gets frustrated and angry within minutes and starts accusing anyone who doesn't agree with them of racism, sexism, bigotry, homophobia, etc, to shut their opponents up and shut down the conversation.

And what the left calls division, under Trump, is actually the right not backing down anymore when the left starts throwing their insults around and the left escalating when they can win with just insults."
131,i1j8x7,"This is why we lose; soft republicans. 

We‚Äôre doomed."
132,i1j8x7,"Having had probably more than 300 ‚Äúcivil debates‚Äù with these morons, I conclude that none of them want their mind changed, each one either ending with them just ‚Äúagreeing to disagree‚Äù or just starting the name calling game when things don‚Äôt go their way. 

The idiots are the majority, dont waste your time debating shit, their minds won‚Äôt be changed, save your breath. Sorry, but its too late for a civil end to the bullshit. They‚Äôll have to come to logic on their own. 

And since most of them are 17 year old blue haired unemployed shitters, they‚Äôll grow out of it eventually, till then, don‚Äôt waste your breath."
133,i1j8x7,"Here's the problem with that naive comment:  The Democratic Party is heavily infiltrated with influential  and wealthy Socialists and Communists with  the sole agenda of destroying our nation.  They've co-opted our universities and public schools, all the social media sites, the major news media channels and some of the largest corporations and just recently the three major professional sports leagues.  Some of those people we see on our news feed almost every day.  If you vote for Democratic politicians, you're voting for the destruction of America.  And that, my friends, makes every Democrat, with or without an obvious agenda to destroy our country, a bad person, a dangerous person.  Republicans have played nice for way too long with the Socialists and Communists infiltrating our government.  They are playing hard ball, time for us to play harder ball."
134,i1j8x7,"Though I agree with this sentiment, I feel like the right is more willing to see the lefts compromises than the left the rights."

136,i1j8x7,Gladly upvoted this. Wholesome.
137,i1j8x7,"Bleeding-heart liberal on the far-left here. I don‚Äôt get anything productive or beneficial out of a hostile, heated argument/conflict. Only trauma. Therefore, I will always advocate that diplomatic, *true* meeting-of-the-minds conversations between adversaries best facilitates empathy, understanding & therefore, resolution.

This refers to conversations devoid of the most common conversation-killers, such as: insults & general disrespect as a result of flaring tempers, posturing & lack of humility/accountability due to personal pride, close-mindedness & intolerance at the behest of personal biases, etc.

I wholeheartedly support the ideology expressed within OP‚Äôs post. It may come across as cheesy or ‚Äúwoo-woo‚Äù, but factually it still stands that nothing is repaired or bettered by hate. Love, empathy & respect is what ultimately lessens suffering, and in order to resolve our country‚Äôs ongoing vitriolic bipartisanship conflicts, those 3 poignant things would be more necessary than ever before."
138,i1j8x7,Exactly!
139,i1j8x7,Lefty who stumbled across this one the front page. Love to see stuff like this. I realized recently with the assholes on both sides coming out that we need to unite now more than ever.

145,i1j8x7,Am liberal. Upvoted this.
146,i1j8x7,Same echo chambers suck and I don‚Äôt really identify with either party anymore but at least the right has the ability to still question things and be philosophical. The left has it all figured out and if you don‚Äôt agree your a fascist. We haven‚Äôt figured everything out and we still need to debate things about society etc...
147,i1j8x7,"To be honest this post isn't wholesome if you aren't willing to change.

A lot of people try tk get in discussions and 100% stick by their guns and then retreat saying ""well I tried"".

You need to accept that you don't know everything and that you're willing to change. Only then can things start to get better."
148,i1j8x7,"We aren‚Äôt all Americans though. A murderer who snuck across the border and is living here illegally is not an American.

I get called names all over Reddit too, from bootlicker to fascist, but the best discussions come when you turn off the name calling and share your thoughts. It happens. Rarely in today‚Äôs age, but it happens."
152,i1j8x7,"Thank you! I‚Äôve been called every single name in the book on Reddit simply because I support our President, and I always try to be respectful of everyone regardless of their political views."
153,i1j8x7,"I literally had a conversation like that tonight. I didn‚Äôt say anything mean or disrespectful and yet they still thought it was appropriate to call me a racist, homophobic, sexist idiot all because I said I was a republican. But it also makes me happy that I ended the ‚Äúconversation‚Äù nicely saying I hope they have a great night and I apologize for making them angry at all while they were still calling me names lol"
154,i1j8x7,"You must remember, not all the dems on reddit, or tv, represent us all. Sorry you were called those things."
155,i1j8x7,Exactly!
156,i1j8x7,"Yeah at that point the conversation ceases to be productive. I was called insane because I tune in to ONE certain individual from time to time. Then the person said he cannot talk to an insane person because I mentioned a specific name. How shortsighted can people be? Instead of attacking someone because they support Trump, listen to a certain person, etc. how about let us keep open minds. That is what I believe is important: open minds."
157,i1j8x7,"Very true, but know your facts and don‚Äôt give up."
158,i1j8x7,To the left now if you dont absolutely hate Trump you are the enemy. They look at us as sub human scum.
159,i1j8x7,This message is targeted at them too.
160,i1j8x7,Hard to have a conversation when the other person denies climate change
161,i1j8x7,"Yeah that‚Äôs already gone though. McCain-Feingold, look it up."
162,i1j8x7,"True, you will not see this type of post on r/democrats or r/politics."
163,i1j8x7,Kinda destroyed the idea of this post with that statement.
164,i1j8x7,By ban do you mean boycott?
165,i1j8x7,"Source?

Boycott does not mean ban."
166,i1j8x7,"you sure it wasn't because the president used his office to advertise their product?

something something sanctity of the office"
167,i1j8x7,honestly that's an extremist reaction and the majority of Dems wouldn't agree.
168,i1j8x7,Exactly I‚Äôm a very far right dude but this so very true when we‚Äôre arguing in reddit we call eachother memes and forget something we‚Äôre all humans and we all want what we see as the best we all wake up In the morning eat breakfast exercise or watch tv and live a life we forget we‚Äôre human
169,i1j8x7,"No matter what anyone tells you, we don‚Äôt hate you. We just need to talk."
170,i1j8x7,"We aren‚Äôt all Americans though. A murderer who snuck across the border and is living here illegally is not an American. Someone who hates the constitution and wants to throw Molotov cocktails at federal buildings can‚Äôt be turned back to the constitution. Many BLM people even deny the existence of America, saying it was founded in 1619 instead and whites need to be eradicated.

There is no such thing as ‚Äúwe.‚Äù"
171,i1j8x7,"I‚Äôm a ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù (more like moderate) and my wife‚Äôs a republican. It keeps things real. By real, I mean that Dem/Rep is just a stupid title. Doesn‚Äôt define me in the slightest. My wife and I want what‚Äôs best for our country, our family, and our neighbors, we just have differing ideas of how to do that. 

I actually think being close to someone with opposing views is a good thing. When I think back to the people I know that completely surround themselves with Republicans/democrats, they tend to think in absolutes and have less respect for the other side."
172,i1j8x7,"Same. I think a lot of people from both  sides can agree on what‚Äôs important, just have different ideas on getting there."
173,i1j8x7,Practically of my friends are liberal. I‚Äôm also a teen in so cal and I go to a jewish school so there aren‚Äôt really many options lol. I just try not to bring up politics because then it gets insane

184,i1j8x7,"Its canned beans and other products. The CEO supports Republican so there has been a tiff between conservatives and liberals over it. The president posted a tween with their product in the oval office, and democratic lawmakers thought that was appropriate for a variety of reasons. Honestly of all the junk that goes on in American politics this is hardly worth remembering."
185,i1j8x7,"Please feel free to ask what my motives are for ANY topic that you wish to learn about!  I happen to think the reason we cannot get anything done is that both sides assign evil motives to the other. That being said, there are issues which have no middle ground or one that is so narrow from one side or the other that compromises is nearly impossible. 

I know someone already answered but Goya is a company that produces many Latino food products.  From canned beans to just about any Latin ethnic food you can think of.  The CEO praised Trump and just like Chick-Fil-A the left called for a boycott of all Goya products.  The response as you can imagine in many of the Latin communities like Cuban and Venezuelan at least here in South Florida was to buy as much Goya products as possible. They do have competitors like Iberia, Libby‚Äôs and others so it was a BUYCOTT that happened."
186,i1j8x7,I respectfully disagree. Post it over there and you‚Äôll see.
187,i1j8x7,"I got you man. It‚Äôs frustrating but we need to try and see thing from other angle. I get it whenever I make a slightly right wing comment on reddit I can kiss 100 karma good by, but the angry mob doesn‚Äôt represent all democrats. I mean have a liberal father but I‚Äôve come to an understanding with him. We can talk and be respectful. The main stream media pushes the notion that we are close minded racist apathetic monsters, but let‚Äôs show them how wrong they are. I‚Äôm sure a lot of democrats get called names like snowflake and libtard, but since we are on reddit conservatives are more singled out since most people on this platform are millennials. But the point stands you gotta keep trying to talk to other people with different viewpoints, no matter how difficult."
188,i1j8x7,I‚Äôm on the left and feel the same way about the right care to discuss like adults? My major problem with the right at this moment is time and again I see it putting capital above human lives. What‚Äôs your major problem with the left. I am talking about the leaders not the people btw

199,i1j8x7,How are we destroying the country all we are seeking to do is change the way we are policed and controlled while turning our backs on the idea that the wealthiest individuals are not supposed to pay their fair share?

201,i1j8x7,"And to think I have been working my ass off cleaning this post up and I just can‚Äôt keep up. As bad as the Right has been on this post, the left is hitting it like 3 times harder."
202,i1j8x7,"The most toxic have been removed.

Show me where you see the toxicity?"
203,i1j8x7,How is bernie a communist?
204,i1j8x7,"Wrong. I‚Äôve talked to liberals who, even thought they knew I disagreed and what my opinions were, were very nice and civil. I honestly think I got more worked up than they did. I should say that they described themselves as liberals, but I think they‚Äôre more moderate that that."
205,i1j8x7,Bullshit
206,i1j8x7,"To be fair, there are lots of stereotypes about the Dems, too."
207,i1j8x7,And that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt give in to your kind. You think we are all stupid.
208,i1j8x7,"What's wrong with a civil conversation ending in ""agreeing to disagree"". Have you ever had your mind changed as the result of one of these conversations? If not, wouldn't it seem unreasonable to expect the other person in the conversation to have their mind changed? If your opinion has changed on the other hand, I'm curious what the topic was and what their argument was that convinced you to change your mind."
209,i1j8x7,"Hey man, just asking, what do you mean by ""they want to destroy America"". It gets said by the right often. Fox, republican politicians, and the president himself have pushed this line, but I've never heard an example of what the end goal is outside of a very vague ""destroy America""."
210,i1j8x7,"Really? The left's general wants are tax funded public medical insurance, increase wages for those at the bottom of society, pull out of the ""forever wars"" we've been involved with since Vietnam. Like those are the 3 big ones and overwhelmingly I've never seen any compromise from the right."
211,i1j8x7,Because conservatism inherently resists cultural change.
212,i1j8x7,"You may find that ‚Äúbleeding heart‚Äù is more center left now. The far left tends not to be liberal, or at least does not seem aligned with liberal values.
 Try the subreddit /rshitliberalssay . (Not sure in spelling, not how to make it a link)  It sounds far right, but is actually communist. Yes, they express more contempt for the center left than most conservatives do"
213,i1j8x7,Ok lets try ....... It seems to me many democrat mayors are telling the police to stand down and let protesters get violent after dark why dont they stop them?
214,i1j8x7,Well said kinda in the middle here but like smart dialogue
215,i1j8x7,"Very nicely put.  If only our leaders would follow the same methodology.  It‚Äôs like they think the American people enjoy it when they act like 5 year olds.  Trump/Pelosi need to have angry makeup sex with each other and move on.

Nevermind I just threw up a little bit thinking about it."
216,i1j8x7,I'm actually a Democrat but I came over here to praise this sentiment of unity. I wish both the left and right would work harder on finding common ground but I see so little of it from either side.
217,i1j8x7,"I consider myself a left leaning moderate. Anyway, I follow both conservative/Republican and democratic/liberal subreddits to better understand both sides and why they may be against or for certain policies."
218,i1j8x7,Dem here. I upvoted.
219,i1j8x7,I don‚Äôt
220,i1j8x7,"I guess I‚Äôd consider myself a Democrat, but we‚Äôre all on the same team at the end of the day"
221,i1j8x7,I‚Äôm a dem I think most people agree with this sentiment
222,i1j8x7,r/Democrats is just a hate trump subreddit
223,i1j8x7,"Dem here. I hate the republican media(Alex Jones, OANN, Ben Shirapino, etc). Republicans are just a product of the media. I think we can all agree on this."
224,i1j8x7,"Its because the subreddit claims to be democrat, leading you to assume that the content creators on there are those of all democrat/liberal positions and opinions, but it's really just controlled by leftists. And if you know anything about leftists, they are actually different than liberals, they just have hijacked the liberal or democratic party. Even if there are moderate, left of center claims from classic liberals like Dave Ruben on there, these posts will most likely be ignored in favor of hardcore left wing posts that fit the agenda of the moderators, who are most likely paid to feature these kinds of far left posts. Furthermore, real classic liberals are too often afraid to come out and state their opinions either in a pessimistic anticipation that their message will fall on deaf ears and/or fear of what the left may to their livelihood and reputation."
225,i1j8x7,"Wait... you're literally doing the thing this post is saying not to do. Stereotypes aren't getting us anywhere,  and I didn't have to scroll far in the comments to find em..."
226,i1j8x7,[removed]
227,i1j8x7,"I fully support the right, but I feel like you are missing the point. The stereotypes and aggression are what perpetuate the hate. This applies to all facets of life. You‚Äôre summarizing the left into one group, but the fact is, there are civilized people on both sides. It‚Äôs social media platforms and MSM who keep us at each other‚Äôs throats. We need to rise above it and learn to work together and coexist. This is the true American way."
228,i1j8x7,"Literally second to top comment is a poorly worded and spelled straw man argument. I came here as a liberal because I like to be educated on both sides of a topic and r/conservative seemed too polarized. I literally came here to have a discussion and before it could even start you decided that I was a leftist who would  you a ‚Äúfascist‚Äù if we didn‚Äôt agree. You have a real human wanting to talk to you right here, and you would rather make up a boogeyman to argue with. You are the thing you claim to hate, and it‚Äôs pathetic."

Give me one single reputable source on this. Just one."
231,i1j8x7,We all probably agree on more things than we might think. Polarization is one of the biggest problems in the western world right now IMO.
232,i1j8x7,Yes things are not perfect and every country has to keep moving forward whatever the path might be. But I believe both sides need to believe in some common foundational values or else things will really not work. I don‚Äôt believe the entire structure needs to be abolished like so many seem to want. They have no answer for what to do after. System isnt perfect but it‚Äôs a pretty good one.
233,i1j8x7,"I have been thinking a lot about this. Especially in the context of the horrible William Barr hearing. ""Statesmanship"" used to be a thing in politics before we arrived at the steel cage death match that it is.

256,i1j8x7,"They were moderates that allowed the party to deal with the left. They were attractive figureheads to moderates like myself. Were they perfect, no. But they were much better than some of the clowns and cowards that get the spotlight and tear down the party now."
257,i1j8x7,Of course brother!
258,i1j8x7,"I have many individual issues with the left but my main issue is their focus on outcome rather than opportunity.   Time and time again we here about income inequality, how the 1% have so much while the other so much less.  How the CEO of Apple makes 1 gazillion while a worker in the call center 30k. The call to do whatever it takes to remedy this is completely insane IMO.  

The left‚Äôs focus on outcome fails to take Into account a person‚Äôs natural and societal advantages!  IQ, Ambition, Physical Ability and plain old dumb luck are natural ones. An intact family, a good education, money are societal ones. Yet there are countless examples of people of all colors and creeds who had both natural and societal advantages that became total failures and those with none and became successful.  As long as someone follows the rules, whatever they make is no one‚Äôs business!  I also find it hypocritical that the income inequality metrics is only applied in certain cases. For example Lebron James makes $37.4million  while J.R. Smith makes $289k but I don‚Äôt hear anyone from the left saying Lebron should be making less to give to Smith. Why?  Because they all know LBJ‚Äôs value to the Lakers is so much more important than Smith‚Äôs. Brad Pitt makes on average $20 million per movie.  The extra makes what couple of K?  Why is there no call to reduce Brad‚Äôs salary to pay the extras more. Could it be because Brad is able to generate more income for the studio than the extra?  So now I ask you:  how is this different from what the CEO of JP Morgan $30 million makes as opposed to a teller in Seattle making $15.00 an hour or so?  Who will have a bigger impact on the success of the Company?  

I will never make $37.4m playing BB or $20m acting in a movie.  I do not have the physical ability for the former or the looks for the latter. Should I demand LBJ and Pitt have their salaries reduced and given to me to reduce income inequality?  Why then the attack on CEO‚Äôs salaries from the left?  Lastly, why is the left‚Äôs plan to solve the problems always to bring those at the top down rather than to bring the bottom up?  The left acts as though it is a zero sum gain!  When Mike makes and extra $500.00 or $500,000.00 it‚Äôs because Susan or Robert or Miles are making $500.00 or $500,000.00 less.  That is not how it works. What anyone makes has no bearing on what you make unless you are a partner is some firm. I don‚Äôt know what you do but if you get a 10% raise tomorrow it does not mean 10 of your co-workers will lose 1% why does the left insist it would? 

Now the focus for everyone should be on working to insure OPPORTUNITY is the same for everyone.  If a person chooses to take the opportunity or not is no one‚Äôs business.  Is opportunity equal for everyone?  Well of course not!  The rich and powerful have advantages, and yet someone like Daymond John who was raised is a single family home and who had their power cut on numerous occasion is a multi-millionaire.  I had the privilege of hearing him speak in person!  He is an example of what anyone can accomplish in America.  There a countless examples of people like Daymond.  That should be the focus!  To find ways to get more Daymond Johns. That is where we need to put our energies and resources!  Not taking from some to give to others. No matter how much you give to people, you cannot ever insure equality. People make choices and those choices have consequences. When you strive for income equality you limit human potential and crush ambition and drive. You remove the consequences of people‚Äôs negative life choices and limit the results of good life choices.  

Finally there are three questions I ask you think about and answer:  

The poor, uneducated and oppressed vote Democrat the Rich vote Republican, or so the story goes so: 

1.  The Republicans want to keep people Poor, Uneducated and Oppressed so they will vote Democrat?  How does this make sense? 

2.  What party needs a reliable voting bloc that delivers 95+% every cycle to have any chance of winning national elections and many state ones too? 

3.  Why are the promises Democrats making to the poor, uneducated and oppressed people in 2020 the same ones they made in 1970?"

What I want in those conversations is the ability for your side to try to step out of the script  preordained by the pundits. I get that some of us do what you dead by the way but they are just as lost as those on your side that want us dead.

268,i1j8x7,that was an intelligent rebuttal
269,i1j8x7,"Idk man. I‚Äôve seen about twice as many posts complaining about how they are unable to speak with the left without ‚Äúbeing labelled as a fascist‚Äù or being silenced. I get why it is the case, being a right-wing subreddit and a small amount of confirmation bias on my part, but I‚Äôm still seeing more right-wing complaints than I am seeing left-wing. 

I‚Äôve also had to go against my previous comment about watching this sub more. Out of 50 top posts I saw, there were only 3 that I somewhat agreed with - this post, another one linking to an article about why people vote left/right and one detailing the hypocrisy of CNN in regards to the use of hydroxychloroquine.

I was saying that the democratic party is against stereotyping yet they're stereotyping us more than we stereotype them especially on r/politics. So I was trying to point out the double standard from a general standpoint, I wasn't necessarily saying that all dems are bad.

But honestly, I'm glad people downvoted my earlier comment because I'll admit, I worded that very poorly and I understand why people weren't too happy about it.

Now as a Republican: No. 

Nothing to have my mind changed to. 

For example: if their arguments were along the lines of: ‚ÄúBorder wall bad because this verified statistic shows that x ‚Äî-> y, but we can compromise because your side also shows that its good because q and Z are also the result‚Äù

Theres some stuff to think about and change minds about. 

However, we all know this isn‚Äôt the typical liberal argument, which goes more along the lines of ‚ÄúCan you believe Trump did this today? Racist.

The protests died down because there was no conflict, no confrontations and no hostility. The mayor idenrified one side was causing issues and overreacting to minor things and settled it by acting like adults and listening to the protests. 

I have voted for Republican more than Democrat. I can see that there is fault everywhere, but bringing a heavy hand dow, on protesters in general for the actions of a few is like the teacher punishing the whole class because one student was an ass at recess. You would think the class would be mad at the kid, but mostly they are mad at the teacher.

280,i1j8x7,"Portlander here. Basically it went like this. Floyd got killed, people got angry at police in general, because there was no immediate consequence to bad policing that we can see. Reason for that is both media looking for outrage and blue wall of silence. Bottom line, people angry and only way they can express it is protest. Emotions matter and people are emotional beings, so they went out and protest police brutality. Some made graffiti or broke some windows, yeah that's bad but again, that's few people and media focused on that.

Next police throws all the tear gas etc, so people already angry got more angry. More anger brought more damage. Then it started to cool off, still some graffiti and shit happened over night but that's it. And them Trump deployed this feds that were sketchy as fuck, not identifiable, totally brutal and looking and behaving like villains from dystopia. Now angry people because of police brutality got really fucking angry and were joined by civil liberties people to protest feds. Feds get brutal, more people get angry and so on.

So, how do you break this death spiral? You deescalate. Feds escalated what was already cooling down. Damage was really nothing in comparison to cost of fucking tear gas. Like, most of  it was graffiti. I bet cost of entire operation, munitions, tear gas etc was 10x higher and bigger burden on taxpayers, both federal and local, than just letting people shout, talk to them, clean up mess and show good will."

As far as raising wages, he gave tax breaks that were mainly beneficial to the wealthy and corporations. Hes continued the push for trickle down economics which has literally never panned out the way they pitch it to. He and the Republicans haven't done anything about raising minimum wage and have talked about wanting to get rid of it entirely.

Also, Obamacare isn‚Äôt insurance. Forcing an insurance company to insure pre-existing conditions is like forcing insurance companies to cover home fires AFTER the fire happened. 


And if you want to lose millions of lives due to the lack of innovation, go with socialized medicine.

But you want us to let leftists into our subreddit to argue with us, why?

The left tried to take this sub over once.  Back before the 2016 election.  We let our members debate the various Republican candidates.  The left thought that meant that they could come to be shitty about ALL the candidates.  They started downvoting submissions about things not even to do with the election.  They downvoted comments from our longtime Republican posters.

We don't DO THAT anymore.

Because the truth is that on reddit we are OVERWHELMED.

People get upset that they can't debate conservatives on reddit, but conservatives left most of the main sites because DEBATE included mass downvoting, harassment, getting banned and even getting death threats in pm's.

OK, let's just say they do actually want to do this, isn't being able to have personal beliefs or ideologies another part of being American? If they‚Äôre trying to dismantle our way of life, then I believe that the majority would not stand for it. Anyways there you go again, saying something about this group of people that voted for Sanders as if it universally applies to the entire group.

>BLM wants to abolish American culture altogether. Half the country hates the anthem, hates the flag. You would be called racist for asking any immigrant to ‚Äúmelt‚Äù in the melting pot. ‚ÄúHow dare you try to force your culture on anyone else?‚Äù

Huh? Wait. American culture? 'I don‚Äôt know if English is your first language or not but that statement implies all Americans are Americans as if we have something in common.'

 So you're saying that perhaps we do have something in common... this ""American culture""? The rest of what you're saying is just conjecture, how many of these people are directly quoted saying ""I hate America"" and ""I seek to destroy the country""? They're protesting in a way that they chose, which is thankfully legal. I DO believe that everyone has a right criticize them for it though.

>Go scroll /popular on Reddit and tell me we have a melting pot mentality in this country. Major universities are calling American spelling and grammar racist.

Folks..."
439,i39vxx,I *would* be caught dead at a BLM rally with a MAGA hat on.
440,i39vxx,"Wearing a MAGA cap gets you de facto castigated as a person who is worth abusing. People in the MSM won't outright condone it.. In fact, they'll say they don't condone it but (big ol' BUT) they **understand** why people feel and act that way (right back to condoning it). 

This is why that Catholic school kid is getting all these settlements in libel lawsuits. He was viciously misrepresented on a national stage for the grand crime of wearing a MAGA hat, standing still, and smiling in a public setting."
441,i39vxx,It ain‚Äôt wrong you know.
442,i39vxx,"As a black female... I‚Äôm just glad that we‚Äôre all aware of this. Please don‚Äôt go to a BLM Rally with any MAGA stuff on trying to prove a point, it isn‚Äôt worth it and the BLM assholes will kill you for it 100%. Ugh."
443,i39vxx,Absolutely true! I think the people at the maga rally would be annoyed maybe but you‚Äôd get straight up murdered at the blm rally.
444,i39vxx,To be fair almost anywhere is safer the a BLM riot....i mean rally.
445,i39vxx,They‚Äôd kill you if you were wearing a normal red hat if they saw you from befind
446,i39vxx,[removed]
447,i39vxx,Last time I wore a maga hat I almost got shot.
448,i39vxx,I think we‚Äôve already seen an example early on of a MAGA hat guy getting beaten to near-death by a BLM mob.
449,i39vxx,You mean that wearing a BLM shirt in a MAGA rally is safer than just living near a BLM rally
450,i39vxx,It's true because MAGA rallies are generally peaceful while BLM rallies are very often violent
451,i39vxx,The people of tolerance and woke-ness are really a bunch of brutal criminals if you don't agree with them.
452,i39vxx,Its not even close. You'd be FAR safe at a MAGA rally
453,i39vxx,"So true, the true racist are the BLM people.  They stand for pure hatred."
454,i39vxx,True story
455,i39vxx,"I've thought of buying a maga but Im pretty  nervious about wearing one, I live in a fairly liberal city and people went ape shit when I say I was voting trump on facebook.  


I mean they were already pissed about me being conservative, but you know... being a trump supporter went to far for my ultra liberal former freinds"
456,i39vxx,Depends what state your in if you wear BLM in Arkansas you‚Äôre fucked
457,i39vxx,Well since BLM rallies seem to repel Covid-19 I guess I'll try it. Wish me luck
458,i39vxx,Send this to crowder asap
459,i39vxx,Yea cuz republicans aren‚Äôt big dicks
460,i39vxx,Perhaps the demographics of the two rallies has something to do with it?
461,i39vxx,A black kid at a white school is safer than a white kid at a black school.
462,i39vxx,"And this, kids, is why white privilege isn‚Äôt real"
463,i39vxx,"You‚Äôre going to get biased answers here simply because of the sub, similar if you went to /democrat and asked the same question. Truth is, you could get messed up at either or have a civil discussion. Depends on what you do and how much of an aggressor yourself is and who you agitate. You will agitate someone, just be smart."
464,i39vxx,So sad but absolutely true.
465,i39vxx,Absofreakinlutely
466,i39vxx,Wow your safer at a event ran by the president with a hat people disagree with. An event with security vs protests that are not formally run with something they are directly protesting against. Wonder why
467,i39vxx,[removed]
468,i39vxx,"Didn't have to add the ""with a maga hat on"". Just being at a BLM rally is enough."
469,i39vxx,"It‚Äôs sad that it‚Äôs true, even if you‚Äôre ‚Äúblack‚Äù, since that‚Äôs apparently a huge factor in everything again"
470,i39vxx,Facts
471,i39vxx,this literally proves that us trump supporters are more tolerant then the ‚Äútolerant‚Äù left.
472,i39vxx,100%
473,i39vxx,Fact!
474,i39vxx,Saw this post too lol
475,i39vxx,[deleted]
476,i39vxx,I thought the dude had an AR15 and a vest üòÇü§£
477,i39vxx,Well according to the news Covid would ignite you at the MAGA rally with your BLM shirt on
478,i39vxx,I follow Angry_vet_ too
479,i39vxx,for reasons tho
480,i39vxx,‚ÄúExperiment and see‚Äù... that sounds like instigating violence to me.
481,i39vxx,This is absolutely true
482,i39vxx,"BLM/Antifa are not only real organizations of the Alt-Left, they are criminal organizations.

They keep changing definitions and hope liability magically goes away. Just know millions think differently with very clear vision. BLM/Antifa are not only organizations, they are very much terrorist organizations of interest. They have millions of individuals attention, including the FBI, CIA, IRS, NSA, and local organized veterans/militias just to name a few. Names, times, places and communications have been monitored and recorded. Evidence is documented. That‚Äôs an irrefutable fact. You see, they have to hide in the shadows like the filthy cowards they are.  It‚Äôs self preservation and the tactics of demented terrorist.

But you‚Äôll see, when the chips are down, these civilized engagements are going to turn very real, very quick. May god have mercy.

How many buildings did the alt-left burn last night? How many outside restaurants did they terrorize last night? How many people did they kill in cold blood?

Too many.

Everyone could go back and forth all day trying to defend Black Lives Matter/police reform protestors vs. ‚Äúwhite lives matter too so fuck BLM and also MAGA‚Äù but at the end of the day; angry and fearful people are going to do some stupid shit from time to time."
484,i39vxx,Yeah nah https://twitter.com/rywriggs/status/1272353892165132288?s=20
485,i39vxx,What‚Äôs wrong with black lives mattering though? I don‚Äôt see why you can‚Äôt be republican and still think Black Lives Matter.
486,i39vxx,Ha!

COVID19 has killed 158,000 people, unemployment is 14%, GDP for the second quarter was -32%, the annual deficit is over $6 trillion dollar (inflation soon to follow), etc, etc. Whether MAGA are more polite to BLM people or vice versa seems like a meaningless distinction"
488,i39vxx,Just don‚Äôt go do either one and you‚Äôll be fine
489,i39vxx,I think we all support blm but not the movement I say all lives matter because black Asian Mexican and white lives all matter no life should come above or below others we are all people and should be treated as so that's why you won't get slaughtered at a maga rally
490,i39vxx,[deleted]
491,i39vxx,i think both can be pretty hostile. it really just depends if there are cameras and police

494,i39vxx,Herman Cain is doing great after attending that rally.

510,i39vxx,People who abuse and assault others who might think differently. Tempting fate if you wear a MAGA hat to a BLM rally but you can wear just about anything to a MAGA rally and won't be checked into a hospital later in the day. I wonder if that in and of itself explains so much of our current news cycles.
511,i39vxx,"Apparently it was because the way he was smirking. I don't see what he did that was even worth covering or what was ""racist"" about it."
512,i39vxx,"It's even funnier when you realize they are willing to lose so much money attacking a kid they probably didn't think would fight back. Glad he received these settlements. He deserved it for standing up for himself, but being respectful during the whole situation."

""Would be annoyed"" enough to physically attack someone. There are counter protesters all the time at BLM protests, and sometimes they react the same way, with violence. Stop trying to go off some unsubstantiated opinion of your side that you're all perfect because you're not. There's assholes that will resort to violence on both sides."

524,i39vxx,But how do you know that it was strictly because of the hat?
525,i39vxx,I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you; would you mind giving some details? I hope the person got in trouble
526,i39vxx,"Man‚Ä¶ it's scary because you aren't wrong.

RIP Jake Gardner.  We'll never forget."
527,i39vxx,I feel like you're being sarcastic...
528,i39vxx,"Well yeah because 99.9% of the white kids couldn't care less what color someone is, but to black people it's all that matters."
529,i39vxx,Bias? On Reddit?
530,i39vxx,"This is bullshit and you know it. Their would be no ""Civil discussion"" at a BLM rally. You'd get mobbed, assaulted and possibly beat to death. How does your nonsensical comment have upvotes? Do you live in reality?"
531,i39vxx,"BS. You can be keeping to yourself just walking and get attacked from behind with a brick by BLM , my side might boo like we did CNN at rallies but NOBODY THAT IS MAGA IS ATTACKING FIRST ."
532,i39vxx,"Pretty lame argument. Republican people in ""liberal"" cities don't even risk wearing any MAGA gear at ALL.  Everyone knows you could be yelled at, abused and refused service at businesses... Some dude at my work parking lot in Los Angeles that had a TRUMP 2016 sticker on his car (he probably moved from out of state and didn't realize) and got his entire car ""keyed"" for the grand sin of displaying support for our current president. The thugs made sure they damaged the sticker part the most to convey the message and  even rubbed some brown substance in it (fecal matter perhaps?)."

541,i39vxx,A one-time financial beatdown for the US due to a virus seems much less damaging than a race war or civil war based on disagreements about fundamental principles.
542,i39vxx,Yeah realistically doing either kinda makes you a moron lol
543,i39vxx,"Yeah noone disagrees that the police sometimes fuckin act a fool when it comes to black people, way to often, it's just the actual movement itself that I hate. I'm 100% on board with taking a look at how our justice system works because it's absolutely broken, and black people seem to get the really shit end of the stick, but I'll never agree with BLM as a whole."

554,i39vxx,"You tried it, HA!"
555,i39vxx,D bag for sure
556,i39vxx,Wrecked. Guess reality is that normal people know what happens if you antagonize the left. You die. It's not just racists that know blm is s terrorist organization.
557,i39vxx,Dumb AF
558,i39vxx,tfw you're literally trash
559,i39vxx,They might be laughed at but not murdered like at a BLM one. Remember the woman beat to death for saying all lives matter?
560,i39vxx,"In the metaphorical sense, quite possibly. It's pretty easy to counter the arguments of black supremacists; ultimately, we just need to use the same arguments we use against white supremacists, and those are pretty well documented."
561,i39vxx,No they'd just get yelled at by fat old men. At a blm really you'll get jumped by 7 black dudes and the one guilty white dude who's there for some reason.
562,i39vxx,"I think the point here is that the BLM movement has terrible optics. If they want to be taken seriously they need to fix this. Ideology here is irrelevant. Barring the current global crises MAGA rally's are generally safe, while in several cases police have refused to provide security at DNC conventions (EX: [Here](https://www.newsweek.com/police-chiefs-refuse-protect-democratic-convention-after-pepper-spray-ban-say-it-would-ensure-1521353)). BLM Needs to police themselves better or else they'll just keep providing ammunition to the opposition. This is an unfortunate reality but it's part of the struggle. They need to distance themselves from the violence and/or take steps to prevent it. The ""Conviction"" and ""Substance"" you mentioned is getting people killed on both sides. (Ex: [Here](https://abcnews.go.com/US/small-town-police-chief-killed-officers-cities-wounded/story?id=71017820))  

""As of July 25, 2020, at least 29 people have died during the protests, with 25 due to gunshot wounds."" (Sauce: [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests#:~:text=As%20of%20July%2025%2C%202020,May%2031%20to%20June%206))"
563,i39vxx,That‚Äôs not even close to being justified for being assaulted or murdered for simply wearing a hat

565,i39vxx,"Real cause : Preserving our Constitutional rights so we don't end up like Cuba or Venezuela

Floyd's murals should be removed . A fentanyl meth junkie who broke into a pregnant woman's home to rob her and shoved a gun into her stomach yelling he was going to kill her baby , all to score more drugs .....pick better martyrs,  yours are all worthless assholes."
566,i39vxx,"lol. That's about the size of it. My grandpa owns a MAGA cap. If he wore it when I was with him walking around in a crowded area, I'd certainly have my eyes peeled for some person trying to mollywhop him"

Plus the number of people killed at the CHAZ gates, like the 16 year old who had enough ammo lobbed at him he and his SUV looked like Swiss cheese."

Only 3 of the names listed were killed by police and 1 of  the 3 killed had attempted to shot at police"
575,i39vxx,And Fallujah
576,i39vxx,"If I‚Äôm being honest it probably wasn‚Äôt because the hat and more because we drove past what seemed like an illegal gun sale.  So basically, we were in the bed of a truck on a dirt road and we come up to a corner and there‚Äôs three people next to a car on the side of the road.  One of them hands a rifle to another guy and then he sees us and grabs the rifle back and cocks it.  He pointed it at us, then he pointed it at the ground and fired about 10 shots.  We assumed that the guy was just trying to scare us off, but it was certainly a scary experience.  We never ended up reporting anything because we didn‚Äôt really have enough information."

580,i39vxx,[removed]
581,i39vxx,Hey man just a heads up you‚Äôre using a misleading headline. I read your article and it says she did not get killed because she said all lives matter that‚Äôs just an inconsequential detail of a terrible loss of life being used to subvert a narrative.
582,i39vxx,"So looking at it all you get beaten at both events... which makes OP's claim still wrong? OK. But nevermind, I guess the one who can cherrypick harder is right here."
583,i39vxx,Okay. Why?
584,i39vxx,"BLM is not just a saying, it‚Äôs a radical anti-white movement that has successfully pulled the veil over America."
585,i39vxx,"No where does it imply that only black lives matter. And you could say the same thing to the all lives matter type. If someone asks you if black lives matter, it‚Äôs simple, you say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and move on. Someone who says ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù to that question or phrase just wants to argue."
586,i39vxx,You believe we are engaged in or near a race war in the United States?
587,i39vxx,Almost as though it benefits someone to keep you all divided against each other...
588,i39vxx,They didn‚Äôt exactly sound like white supremacists even though they stereotypically look like ones.
589,i39vxx,Those guys didn‚Äôt even sound like white supremacists from the little bit I watched.  Looked like a video of guy going to start shit for his YouTube channel by wearing a blm shirt.
590,i39vxx,They are wearing maga hats and tshirts
591,i39vxx,"So what a second, is all democrats a commie that supports a man that committed  genocide to 10 million of his own people? Are all dems a lazy Marxist that doesn't want to work?

606,i39vxx,"The post didn‚Äôt say anyone died, why are you adding something that wasn‚Äôt said?  Some people are afraid to wear MAGA clothing, many, many instances of being attacked, physically. Fact"
607,i39vxx,[deleted]
608,i39vxx,Which one?
609,i39vxx,"Im arguing in good faith here. Yes, you're right that we can point to a video and see examples of violence on either side, however, the reason I chose this video is because you have a young woman silently protesting by holding a BLM sign while the whole town closes in on her, mocks her, makes her feel unsafe, rips her sign, and someone even punches her, all who the cops stand by and do nothing. 

I wasn't trying to cherry pick with this video but show how aggressive and unprovoked the response was to a single person holding a BLM sign. I have not seen a single example of a person on the right protesting against an unjust cause treated this way and with law enforcement looking the other way.

And here's my issue with this whole post. OP is creating a binary between MAGA and BLM supporters like they're the two teams you can belong to. I know that BLM tends to be one of the many polarizing issues that you can cut down the middle almost by what political party you are for or against, but the issue with this is that by if you're a MAGA person, you're a supporter of Trump, a president. If you're a BLM person, you are protesting against the mistreatment and injustices of black people due to systemic racism. You can't act like those are equal and opposite groups. If you show up at a BLM rally wearing a MAGA hat you are inherently being an agitator by saying fuck your whole movement, go TRUMP! You're crashing a protest to make a political endorsement which is coded given Trumps personal views of BLM.

On the other hand, crashing a MAGA rally with a BLM sign is bringing a protest or cause to a political event, which has always happened. I don't see that as someone being an agitator, because that doesn't imply they are there to piss Trump folks off, rather there to further their movement, which in a different time could also be aligned with many people's interests regardless of who the president is.

To put it differently, a person bringing a ""protect the 2nd"" poster to Biden rally is engaging in exercising their 1st amendment in a meaningful way and could even spark interesting conversations. Show, up at a 2nd amendment support rally holding a Biden banner, and you're just being an asshole. What's your point in being there and what statement are you trying to say?"
610,i39vxx,"For starters, they're admitted open marxists, which fundamentally disagrees with our founding principles. Secondly, the implication of saying ""black lives matter"" is that there are enough people who don't believe this that we must spread the message. This is insulting, wrong, and immature. The organization deserves to be metaphorically curb-stomped for making that their catchphrase, name, and chant (and for hiding anti-american nonsense ideas behind that facade)."
611,i39vxx,I don‚Äôt think you understand my point
612,i39vxx,"Explain why the phrase ""black lives matter"" would be chosen to wedge between all Americans otherwise? Racialize everything, politicize everything around race, polarize people to choose a side in the fake race war, turn the fake race war real with actual riots. Seems like we're on a path to me."
613,i39vxx,As a catholic man I do not condone this evil I do not ever and I mean ever support white supremacy these people are a shame to Republicans
614,i39vxx,White supremacists aren't allowed to wear maga hats? And do you actually believe all trump supporters are white supremacists?

On the other hand, counter cherrypickied content showing BLM being aggressive is now also pretty pointless, it only makes the case that both are aggressive, which shows that it's a feelings argument OP made with cherrypicked ""evidence"". When it's their side it's only ""a few bad peope with good intentions"". On BLM site it's everyone. Same with the protests, police are only a few bad apples, but rioters...all of them.

640,i39vxx,"True, but she was killed for being in a group where someone said all lives matter, and that's only if she didn't say ALM. maybe the title is a bit misleading, but the situation still proves that there are bad people that are a part of the BLM movement. Not saying everyone in the BLM movement is bad though."
641,i39vxx,"I read the article and it says that her group got into an altercation with another group that involved guns, after realizing that they both had guns they backed off, but the BLM group shot the women afterwards by hiding past the bridge and waiting for them.

‚ÄúIt was squashed, and they went up the hill and left, we thought, but they were sitting on St. Clair waiting for us to come under the bridge, and that‚Äôs when she got shot,‚Äù Ramirez told WXIN.

So she was essentially killed because she said, or was part of a group where someone said all lives matter. If I missed a statement in the article let me know."
642,i39vxx,"I agreed with the main point you were making but I was taking it further by saying that its not a fair comparison to make. Yes, either side can cherry pick whatever videos they want but it's an inherently flawed premise by OP. I wasn't trying to say that you were making that argument I guess I was addressing the comments in general not just yours. My bad"
643,i39vxx,"Ok.

The reason people object to the term ‚ÄòBlack Lives Matter‚Äô is not because they actually disagree with the literal meaning of the phrase. It‚Äôs because it is the motto of a movement that they fundamentally disagree with, i.e. one that has been self described as a Marxist movement and one that propagates a falsehood regarding the alleged systematic mistreatment of black people by the police.

It is for this same underlying principle that people disagree with the phrase ‚ÄòAll Lives Matter‚Äô. People who object to the phrase don‚Äôt do so because they genuinely do not believe that all lives matter, it is because they see the phrase as part of an ideology that opposes the Black Lives Matter movement."

647,i39vxx,Those are literally 5 unsolved murders. I just looked each of them up. Attributing them to #BLM is just wrong without further evidence.
648,i39vxx,The article says that someone in the group used a racial slur first which prompted the ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù that was then responded to with ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù so ‚Äúessentially‚Äù she was killed because someone in her group couldn‚Äôt pass up on an opportunity to taunt a group of different people. Again they responded incorrectly but we can‚Äôt pick and choose stimulus to fit a narrative
649,i39vxx,"Lmao completely different than what you're responding to. Also, it wasn't a BLM rally. It was a group of people hanging out at 3am and the girl who got killed (which is horrible, nonetheless) was with someone who used a racial slur. That's what started the altercation at 3am. Whole situation is fucked, but that's not even close to a girl walking through a Trump rally with a BLM sign."
650,i39vxx,"No worries. I mean my comment was ambiguous, otherwise I wouldn't have positive karma in this thread while shitting on the narrative."
651,i39vxx,"Everything about their behavior suggests that the people who use the ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù motto do so because they don‚Äôt want to publicly say ‚Äúno‚Äù to the ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù motto.  Also, you can cut the ‚Äúalleged‚Äù bullshit,  that makes you pretty transparent."

For clarification, the husband (a Latino man), or someone in the group said a variation of the n word. It wasn‚Äôt directed at anyone, but was overhead by the other group and they objected to it so much apparently that they decided it was worth killing them over. 

Please don‚Äôt play your ‚Äúthat‚Äôs misleading‚Äù stuff and then lie about the fact that they ‚Äòtaunted‚Äô the other group. They were having a private conversation and somebody interjected with a political statement. They got in return exactly what they gave, an unprompted political statement. Then these people decided they couldn‚Äôt handle getting what they were giving, and decided to murder them.

Edit: removed curse words"
656,i39vxx,"That's what the article is trying to say though, that she did in fact died because someone in her group said all lives matter (quite possibly her) and she didn't deserve to die, sure they shouldn't have been using racial slurs, but that's completely irrelevant to the death because the slur caused an argument, the ALM comment caused guns to be drawn out, and the death of a woman."
657,i39vxx,"I‚Äôve used the phrase ‚Äòall lives matter‚Äô. I‚Äôm also a black man. I clearly believe that my own life matters, along with all the other black lives. I just do not believe that the police systematically discriminates against black people, which a proper analysis of the statistics clearly reveals. The rate at which police kill civilians is relatively high in comparison to other countries, however it is like this regardless of race, hence ‚Äòall lives matter‚Äô"
658,i39vxx,"Looks like Julian Conelly was just arrested. And if found guilty I'll accept a blm protestor committed a heinous crime. I am also 1000% certain that murdering 8 year olds isn't part of what the protestors want.

659,i39vxx,Okay I‚Äôll give you I may have had some details incorrect based on what I read but I more than once made a point of saying that they were entirely wrong. How about you figure out the context of the debate then come back and try again.
660,i39vxx,"I don‚Äôt think the slur is irrelevant. It‚Äôs the instigation. If I said my house burned down and I lost all my stuff in a fire, nobody would even entertain me if I tried to say that me lighting the match is irrelevant"
661,i39vxx,"Ok well, you‚Äôre in London, I‚Äôm talking about the US. I‚Äôm glad the police in England don‚Äôt systematically discriminate there."
662,i39vxx,"The context of the ‚Äòdebate‚Äô you‚Äôre trying to have is irrelevant. You‚Äôre denouncing what happened while simultaneously subtly claiming that it was actually sort of the girl‚Äôs fault or someone in her group for using a slur. 

> so ‚Äúessentially‚Äù she was killed because someone in her group couldn‚Äôt pass up on an opportunity to taunt a group of different people

You‚Äôre dead wrong, debate over"
663,i39vxx,"Well lets say you dropped that match which caused the fire. If you held onto that match and lit the candle, your house wouldn't be burned down, if someome in her group didn't say ALM, nobody would of drawn guns and get shot later on."

I'm disheartened by so much these days that I am just exhausted. 

I'm exhausted of hearing both liberals and conservatives wanting the same basic things (protection for citizens, protections of individual rights, etc) but both sides are so entrenched in ideologies and 'who's to blame' that we can't even have a conversation anymore. I'm tired that compromise is equated with failure or 'selling out'. I'm tired of catching even myself passing judgement against people with Trump or Biden signs in their yards.

As I walk past, I give him a big smile (bc I saw what just happened) he then says to me ‚Äúdo you want a gift card too?‚Äù At this moment I notice his firearm. I say no thank you but wow I‚Äôm impressed you are open carrying! He smiled and nods, I said good for you! The whole exchange gave me some hope. We see so much about racism and I find in my daily life, people just go about living their lives. Working, paying their bills, taking care is their families.

740,iyz7ry,"Now this is a better counter point. But the gun laws, i.e., stricter protocols when buying guns does not prohibit gun ownership, you can still buy them after meeting the criteria (example, mental health).

Now for protesting, what criteria should you set to differentiate violent actors from innocent protestors?

Again, the left media never said gun owners = killers. But Fox and all the right media have equated protestors with looters"

If you read what is actually being proposed it is very pro-police! I've heard many officers complain that they feel like babysitters, or are dealing with severe mental health symptoms that dont present as dangerous. 

The movement is advocating the police force of the future. Hire trained defense and de escalation experts to be police. Hire trained mental health interventionists to work with non violent homeless people. You get the picture."

751,iyz7ry,"Can you please expand on the experience that random people feeling the need to open carry in a clothing shop gives you hope? 

(Sorry, I'm not sure how to word that question without sounding judgemental, I just don't quite understand why that isn't sad/disconcerting instead.) 

I completely understand people wanting to feel safe and protect your family and stuff, and people going hunting, shooting for fun, or sport, professionally, or defence against wild animals, but I feel like it could also trigger escalation of a confrontation pretty quickly, or an otherwise unarmed criminal snatching it or something?"
752,iyz7ry,"I‚Äôm guessing this exchange happened in either a republican area or in the 1950‚Äôs.

Edit - I have to edit this because people on this sub are clearly need a follow on explained.  BECAUSE leftists would be flipping out over a black person having a firearm - because they‚Äôre both anti 2A and also racists."
753,iyz7ry,"Cause getting a concealed carry can be time consuming and in some states- expensive?

Like again I agree it‚Äôs much better to conceal carry but ya know"

755,iyz7ry,"I think your missing the point of ""concealed"". Plus nowadays safety is a important thing."
756,iyz7ry,If you live wayyyy out in the stix....I can see how open carry laws are a good way to let you do your thing while staying in compliance; even though you‚Äôre not likely to come across many (if any) people while you‚Äôre out and about. Open carrying while you‚Äôre shopping at Lowe‚Äôs or picking up some things at the grocery store like your about to invade Poland? That‚Äôs just sad. Get a CPL or leave that shit at home where it belongs.
757,iyz7ry,"> which means there are still some who don‚Äôt see the difference in your own social circles

OF COURSE.  i state this when i say ""majority"" and not all.  you, however, were complaining that we can't see that it's a minority (again, most can), and in the same breath you apply the same logic of generalizing us.

that's why i downvoted.  i'm done with you.  either you knew that and made a disingenuous argument or you're too dim to get it.

761,iyz7ry,"Leftist and Statist elected officials' statements to media make it clear. They do not want the People to have arms for personal protection.  


Yeah, they make statements about weapons of war should not be on the streets. Sounds great too. What they don't tell you is they consider ANY and EVERY firearm (including the fully automatic Semi-automatics (wtf?!)) to be a weapon of war, therefore desire to disarm you.  


Add to that they are also saying only the police should have these ""dangerous"" weapons... and are now calling for defunding and disbanding the police.  


So if I cannot rely on myself or the police to save me in the event of a hostile actor, who am I supposed to rely on?"

773,iyz7ry,Took me 2 hours and cost a total of $140 in AZ. Perhaps it is more expensive in other states but $140 ain‚Äôt sht compared to what ammo costs now lol. But I do understand. I wish constitutional carry was in all states.
774,iyz7ry,"? All I am saying is concealed is 100x better than open carry, IMO."
775,iyz7ry,Whats the point of concealed
776,iyz7ry,"I am nether dim nor Disingenuous but your criticism of my question and attacking of my intelligence tells me that your open mindedness might be both.

798,j3qg7g,"Tulsi is the only sane politician left from the democrats.

Edit: Wow thank you all for the upvotes. As an Armenian American, and a proud citizen of this country, just wanted to add that the USA is indeed the best country in the world. üá∫üá∏"
799,j3qg7g,I may not agree with her political views at times but she has shown class and common sense which is desperately lacking on the left.
800,j3qg7g,Tulsi is among the best our nation has. A fine human being. One of the few democrats worth taking seriously. But that‚Äôs not what that ship of fools do is it -.
801,j3qg7g,guys ima be honest. i don't think i would mind if tulsi won as a democrat in a future election
802,j3qg7g,A welcome message. How refreshing to see someone behave with such class.
803,j3qg7g,That was very nice of her
804,j3qg7g,Classy and decent but they will have her head.
805,j3qg7g,One of the few promising Democrats left in the party. The Dems could've a better chance by nominating her but NOPE.
806,j3qg7g,I'm actually surprised.
807,j3qg7g,Make democrats sane again Tulsi!
808,j3qg7g,I wish more members of her party had morals
809,j3qg7g,"She should be the future of the Democratic Party if they want to salvage any shred of respectability, but instead they look to the likes of the one who is an affront to the good, the true, and the beautiful: Ilhan Omar."
810,j3qg7g,Tulsi is what a common democrat looked like in the late nineties and early 2000‚Äôs. Sad that people like her are a rarity now. Respect.
811,j3qg7g,She is the only democrat that was on the debate stage I had any respect for.
812,j3qg7g,I think tulsi is one of the only Democrat‚Äôs that could maybe make me want to switch sides.
813,j3qg7g,If they‚Äôd nominated her instead of sleepy joe she probably wins tbh. But instead they went with an establishment  straight white male who‚Äôs been in power for over 45 years. What does that say about the party for women and minorities
814,j3qg7g,Tulsi has class
815,j3qg7g,Class
816,j3qg7g,"Classy, that's nice."
817,j3qg7g,Wait we‚Äôre allowed to be human?
818,j3qg7g,There is one
819,j3qg7g,Tulsi Gabbard is good people. And that's about the best compliment I can give someone.
820,j3qg7g,Tulsi rocks
821,j3qg7g,One of the classiest politician in our times!
822,j3qg7g,Mazie Hirono  could take a few pointers in class from Tulsi.
823,j3qg7g,She was the only normal one of the dem stage.
824,j3qg7g,"If she was the candidate, it would be super close"
825,j3qg7g,Glad I don't have a Twitter account.... I'm sure that place is a dumpster fire
826,j3qg7g,While I don't agree with all of Tulsi's policies I respect here and could see her running on a cross-party ticket in a few years. I certainly would be open to voting for her
827,j3qg7g,Need more like her. Class act.  Respect.
828,j3qg7g,"Maybe wrong to assign alternative motives, but I feel like she is setting herself up to be the democratic nominee in 2024 should Biden lose. She really would be the ‚Äúreturn to decency‚Äù candidate."
829,j3qg7g,You are a class act!!
830,j3qg7g,She's one of the few good Democrats left. Who do you think will say something awful first? My frontrunners are DeBlassio or Pelosi.
831,j3qg7g,Tulsi Gabbard is the voice of reason/decency in the Democratic party. Respect is right.
832,j3qg7g,"Tulsi is the only Democrat in this cycle I would have even considered voting for.  I still likely would vote Trump, but it would have been a tougher decision.

I know everyone says that.  But it's true.  Dems probably would have won this election if they had run Tulsi.

Biden only appeals to those who were already going to ""vote blue no matter who"" and nobody else."
833,j3qg7g,Tulsi has always seemed like one of the good ones
834,j3qg7g,"Unless, by aloha, she really means ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù"
835,j3qg7g,I see a lot of people saying classy act or good act. Fellas. This should be NORMAL.
836,j3qg7g,Trump is still a person. Politics have nothing to do with this. Everyone regardless of party lines should hope he makes it through.
837,j3qg7g,"Tulsi has always been such a standup woman, regardless of what you think about her politics."
838,j3qg7g,Still can't believe how dumb the Dems were not to run her
839,j3qg7g,I would sincerely vote for her
840,j3qg7g,And shes a hot
841,j3qg7g,Fine Women...
842,j3qg7g,"A breath of fresh air from the D side. 

She will end up either taking over the D party and changing it (like Trump did for Rs) or leaving the D party if they continue with their trajectory toward radical, unhinged insanity. Which is almost complete."
843,j3qg7g,I like her. She destroyed Kamala so hard the left doesn't dare trot her around with Biden as much as they could have.
844,j3qg7g,Class act. I‚Äôm glad Biden didn‚Äôt pick her as the VP!!
845,j3qg7g,Respect is earned
846,j3qg7g,"I‚Äôm not exactly a fan of assuming it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù time for his family. Most people have mild symptoms. Not really difficult for a lot of people. 

Unless she is talking about politics. That‚Äôs got to be difficult hearing the left is hoping one of your family member dies from COVID because they don‚Äôt like his politics."
847,j3qg7g,She‚Äôs like the only saving grace of that accursed party.
848,j3qg7g,"Classy, but I still wouldn‚Äôt vote for her because she‚Äôs too extreme on abortion."
849,j3qg7g,Tulsi is way to classy to be a democrat
850,j3qg7g,He will be back fit and fine..
851,j3qg7g,Is Tulsi a closet Republican? I thought she would have been a formidable opponent for Trump.
852,j3qg7g,"Tulsi needs to leave the Democratic Party, she is to classy for them."
853,j3qg7g,I‚Äôd vote for her
854,j3qg7g,She is a better statesman than the lot. She should be where Biden is
855,j3qg7g,Is she positioning a switch to GOP?
856,j3qg7g,"It‚Äôs 8:38am on October 2, 2020 and Biden and Harris have yet to say anything, meanwhile politicians and world leaders everywhere are offering their well wishes to the Trump family.

Embarrassing."
857,j3qg7g,I would have voted for her over Trump and I have never voted for a democrat. The DNC had their chance to put up a serious candidate. She is a class act and having nothing but respect for Tulsi.
858,j3qg7g,Love and quick recovery!
859,j3qg7g,Does she have a son named Isaac
860,j3qg7g,Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean you have to be a dick about it.
861,j3qg7g,I wish more Democrats could show respect across the isle like she can. Respect.
862,j3qg7g,"finally, a good democratic person on twitter"
863,j3qg7g,"Run again, I‚Äôd be proud to call her my president !"
864,j3qg7g,Wish her policies weren‚Äôt so fucking left bc she‚Äôs a good person.
865,j3qg7g,"Tulsi Gabbard has continuously impressed me. She was the best person on the Democratic debate stage, and the only Democrat in recent memory that I could consider voting for due to her incredible foreign policy stance.

Much respect. I wish more Democrats were like her."
866,j3qg7g,That is called class.
867,j3qg7g,"She‚Äôs good in my book, idc"
868,j3qg7g,"One of the last common sense, class act, intelligent politicians in the Democratic party who is not a socialist, Marxist or full blown communist."
869,j3qg7g,I wish we could have seen more of you Tulsi. All the best!
870,j3qg7g,She would have won soo many republicans if she became the presidential nominee.
871,j3qg7g,Everyone has said some version of this exact same thing. It's not really that special.
872,j3qg7g,I think Tulsi is like the last of the real old school kennedy style democrats.  Back when they where still conservative
873,j3qg7g,"I occas vote for Dems.  This kind of class, along w military service, would likely get my vote."
874,j3qg7g,Shows how vile the democrats are when someone who doesn‚Äôt wish death upon someone is seen as a saint
875,j3qg7g,If Biden would‚Äôve picked tulsi as his running mate I‚Äôd put a Biden flag up in my yard
876,j3qg7g,Tulsi rubs me right....mhhhhhmm
877,j3qg7g,"She must be a Dino. Because, she exhibits class."
878,j3qg7g,"Classy on her part. Missing otherwise from the Left.  


I wonder how much trouble Trump would be in if she were his opposition instead of Joe..."
879,j3qg7g,DINO
880,j3qg7g,"one of the only democrats I respect. I'd never vote for her, she still has some views that are too liberal. That said, she's a class act."
881,j3qg7g,I'd like to see her have a role in the next cabinet.  Foreign policy related.
882,j3qg7g,Tulsi - the bridge we need but nobody will build.
883,j3qg7g,Tulsi is a great person. She's the sort of politician I can respect
884,j3qg7g,"Fuck yeah, Tulsi is great. The only I would probably vote for. She seems honest, moderate, and not full of shit; which is why the DNC fucked her over."
885,j3qg7g,"See, that is the correct response!"
886,j3qg7g,If she had won the democratic ticket she probably would have beaten trump. It says a lot that the whole Democratic Party fought so hard to get her out.
887,j3qg7g,If she runs again in ‚Äò24 she‚Äôll probably get my vote. She‚Äôs the only democrat that I‚Äôve somewhat agreed with and it‚Äôs refreshing as all hell
888,j3qg7g,"In all honesty, I would‚Äôve much rather seen Tulsi been nominated. It would‚Äôve been close-ish, as she‚Äôs one of the few sane ones."
889,j3qg7g,"If the democrat party chose Gabbard we may have actually had a competition. She was the only chance the left had at scooping up moderates. But no, they‚Äôre going full socialist. This is the mistake they keep making...Too radical, ew!"
890,j3qg7g,"If he dies, and I quote, ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù"
891,j3qg7g,"I may not be the biggest fan of trump yet I‚Äôm republican, but I still have massive respect for the man because he‚Äôs the president, my prayers and condolences go out to their family."
892,j3qg7g,Gabbard/Wang ticket ... 2024
893,j3qg7g,"Man, if only there was some sort of protective barrier he could have worn on his face whenever in public that would have helped reduce his exposure to the virus!"
894,j3qg7g,She's a class act.
895,j3qg7g,"Maybe she can flip parties and get the nomination next year, she would be amazing!"

We seem to have forgotten that this is our country. Ours, as in mine, and yours, and theirs. We need to live together even if we disagree.

Isn‚Äôt compromise better? Tulsi has shown her true colors in the past year, and while I disagree with her on some policy I believe she is an honorable, honest, and wise leader."

907,j3qg7g,"Yeah, being hateful is not truly a productive state to be in, but at the same time I can understand and sympathize where those who are in that position are coming from. If they lost their loved ones --friend, family, or lover-- to this pandemic and experienced how their lost are being downplayed, then it can tragically be difficult to get over that hatred for someone who was source for that loss.

920,j3qg7g,how about biden? i don't agree with his policies but he said something similar to Tulsi
921,j3qg7g,Her and Yang.

927,j3qg7g,I jerk off with my left hand thinking about her farting on my face
928,j3qg7g,[removed]
929,j3qg7g,The biggest sign that she is the only decent person left in the DEM Party is the fact that when she gained popularity she was immediately labeled as a russian agent by Hillary and other DEMS.  A page right out of their playbook for people who don't tow the party line and are perceived as a huge threat.
930,j3qg7g,"I wouldn't be shocked if she did get the nomination for president at some point.

After everyone is tired of all the screaming, they'll probably look to a politician that isn't screaming.

While I'm not fond of the Clintons, I could see Tulsi being Bill Clinton minus all the affairs."
931,j3qg7g,Yeah. I'm not sure we can consider her a Dem anymore though.
932,j3qg7g,"I love this response so much as a dem. We all want the common goal of the entire nation to do well., just different ways of going about it. Takes a big man to lend respect to your ""opposition"". We are all in this together. Good on ya."

940,j3qg7g,She's not even really a democrat. She just runs as democrat because our country insists on a 2 party system. Her policies are almost identical to Bernie Sanders'.

943,j3qg7g,"Because all the left see is identity politics, not policy. They think people voted for Trump because he was an older white male. No, he just had really good ideas, and he was an outsider. This is an establishment vs anti-establishment election"
944,j3qg7g,"His Vice President is an Indian-African American woman? It may have been nice to have her at the top of the ticket, but the alternative choice is two white straight males."

She is a Democrat."
955,j3qg7g,"She thinks for herself and doesn‚Äôt go along with the rest of the groupthink libs. She doesn‚Äôt bow down to their authoritarian rule, either. No wonder the left doesn‚Äôt like Tulsi."

957,j3qg7g,It's amazing how having common decency and disagreeing with the extreme left on like 3 issues out of 100 makes people think she can't possibly be a Democrat.
958,j3qg7g,Her policies disagree with that statement.  Suffice to.say she seems like a decent person though.
959,j3qg7g,"Except being in favor of the Green New Deal, free college, single payer healthcare, massive gun control, legalizing prostitution, abortion on demand, is against nuclear weapons and introduced a censure bill against the president. Shit she should run in 2024 as a republican!"

968,j3qg7g,"I asked this elsewhere in the thread to another user, but if it's okay with the general vibe of the thread, would you mind if I asked you a follow up as to why you are supportive of her? 

I know other conservative and right-leaning conservatives have commended her stance on war in particular. However, I am somewhat cautious about her profession of anti-war, for reasons I've detailed down below (with quotes). 

Additionally, she has some of the most radical opinions in Congress right now, and it doesn't align at all with the way she is discussed by respective political tents. She cosponsored an amendment that would abolish corporate personhood, pledged to accept no PAC money, and wants to restore the Glass-Segall act. She's staunchly anti-gun and wants to legalize weed and cosponsored the Marijuana Justice Act.

As for her point of view on war, I admit that I don't really understand her stance, as she describes herself:

>""When it comes to the war against terrorists, I'm a hawk,"" but ""when it comes to counterproductive wars of regime change, I'm a dove.""

I have been left with the impression that much of our involvement in the Middle East began under the pretense or theory of being a ""war on terror,"" and became a mire of regime change. I'm not dismissing her stance out of hand, and I appreciate her public statements against the civilian damage being done in the Middle East, as well as her point about the damage of regime changes (and how it contributes to the problem of refugees). However, how does that square with her call to action in Syria as shown in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/649615636088365058)? When does bombing in Syria stop being about the war on terror and start being about regime change? Would that not also contribute the the problem of refugees that she's acknowledged continuously for a decade? (Well, at the time of the tweet, half a decade)."

>She cosponsored an amendment that would abolish corporate personhood, pledged to accept no PAC money, and wants to restore the Glass-Segall act. She's staunchly anti-gun and wants to legalize weed and cosponsored the Marijuana Justice Act. She wants to decriminalize sex work at the federal level. She's shown support for the Portugal model of decriminalizing and even legalizing all drugs and specifically narcotics. She's pro-abortion and cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act. She cosponsored the OFF Act, which sought to ban fracking and legislate a transition to renewable fuels and energy on a faster and more efficient timeline than the GND (if it had been binding legislation). 

I know that not all of these are all conservative issues - there are pro choice conservatives, pro-environment conservatives, anti-PAC conservatives, for sure - I just find her, socially/domestic policy wise, very far left even for many Democrats, and struggle to believe that she has the appeal that she does among nationwide conservatives/Republicans. I even have my doubts that she has broad appeal among nationwide Democrats. What is it about Tulsi's positions that appeals to you?"

Obviously, we‚Äôre in the midst of a big political battle right now, and while there‚Äôs a lot at stake, let‚Äôs remember that we‚Äôre all Americans. We‚Äôre all human beings.

Buttigieg:

Klobuchar:

>I‚Äôm sending my thoughts and prayers to the President and First Lady. My family knows firsthand how difficult this disease can be, and no family should have to go through that. We‚Äôre wishing them a speedy recovery.

Many conservatives and Republicans had kind and classy words when Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away. I think it is important to remember that from the most idealistic point of view, we as Americans do not revel in death (EDIT: and/or illness or other harm) and have empathy for our fellow countrymen. In the most cynical camp, we can at least acknowledge the cruelty, callousness, and bad taste of making comments celebrating and wishing harm on one another, and be glad that the majority of leaders on either side do not advocate for those positions."

So basically I liked what she said I'm debates sand really didn't look much into her more.
1034,j3qg7g,"That is an understandable position, and I do respect it. May I ask how you judge someone as to whether or not their belief is phony? Or whether or not someone can fairly and reasonably change their minds? 

A bipartisan example: although I disagree with him on....almost everything, Dick Cheney has been a supporter of the right to gay marriage since Bush's first term.  Likewise Ted Kennedy, who publicly supported the position since his time as a senator in the 1990s. If either of them did so earlier, it is only because I cannot find a record of it within 2 minutes on the internet, so apologies if either date is wrong. On the other hand, Obama did not voice his support until 2011, and Republican senator Rob Portman (and former republican governor Jon Huntsman) announced it around the same time - one before and one after Obama's announcement. I've no reason to believe that either of those decisions were politically motivated, though. As a bisexual woman, I'm stunned at how rapidly things have improved in my life and my civil liberties - in 15 to 20 years, it seems like public opinion on the rights of LGBT citizens have changed like night and day. But opinions do change, organically and genuinely, and I've made peace with that and people's past decisions. If that makes sense? 

And then a follow up question again: obviously a lot of Gabbard's positions would require a lot of public, and specifically federal-level, funding. Although gay marriage is not a perfect example (as not every conservative/Republican is a social conservative), the driving monetary policy/platform of the GOP has been fiscal conservatism and reduced government spending/bloat. If I'm misspeaking, please correct me. In your personal opinion, where is the dividing line/how should it be drawn in regards to ""high public spending,"" ""public funds siphoning,"" and ""public fund waste?"""

I just have seen a lot of support for Tulsi Gabbard growing among right-leaning libertarians and conservatives recently, and have been surprised by this. I also like to try and ask individuals for clarification when possible, because it has nothing to do with Russia or a personal dislike, just surprise at the incompatibility of her positions with a lot of both conservative and broad-spectrum libertarian values."
1040,j3qg7g,"I‚Äôm judging people based on their actions over a course of public life. Obviously people can and do change their positions all the time and I‚Äôm willing to give people the benefit of the doubt by and large.

However some people are so unbelievably obvious about their loose value system. Like Hillary Clinton and her ‚Äúpersonal and public‚Äù comment. While I don‚Äôt disagree in principle with that comment (I also happen to believe Obama probably always supported gay rights but it wasn‚Äôt politically expedient at the time) but I don‚Äôt think one should wildly flop around chasing the 51% nor do I think someone should represent a belief that don‚Äôt personally agree with.

I think a lot of times people forget just how many people die everyday. 15-20 years is a generation gone and a generation born. People born 60 years apart have very different opinions and grew up in very different words.

I think a lot of the older generation, at least for gay marriage, simply didn‚Äôt know any gay people or they were closeted and so they did the old ‚Äúout of sight out of mind to it‚Äù.

The more acceptable it was the more people dealt with it in their personal lives and some probably honestly change their opinions.

I would juxtapose that to say abortion. Which has not seen much flux in public support.

When I say ‚Äúpublic funds siphoning‚Äù I‚Äôm talking about grift. Like Hunter Biden grifting. Not public funding.

Stuff like ‚ÄúMedicare for all‚Äù and other lefty stuff Tulsi likes that cost money is a public policy issue. I would debate the policy on a case by case basis but that is fundamentally a different question than stacking the Supreme Court or removing the Senate.

The fact Biden couldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno‚Äù to court packing at the debate when he has before tells me his position is a politically expedient one not a sincere one and that makes me distrust him."
1041,j3qg7g,Ah okay
1042,j3qg7g,There are much better ways for Americans to receive healthcare.  The green deal introduces significant costs with radical programs that will cost more than projections.  I could actually see the benefits of universal insurance so everyone would be in the same pool but I have no faith in our governments ability to run it functionally or to minimize cost overruns.
1043,j3qg7g,"I think we mostly agree regarding people changing their opinions. I happen to agree with you regarding Obama's position on gay rights, but I also don't think it's important either way. I agree with you on chasing the 51% in some regard, but I would like to offer a secondary opinion/concern of mine, which is that major political figures (whether congressional or executive) are meant to represent in as many ways as is feasible, the will and interests of the American people and/or their state. For example, if you are in one regard fiscally or socially conservative/liberal, but the overwhelming majority of people in your state disagree on that, I think it's fine to have personal and public opinions. I prefer politicians acknowledging when they are choosing to represent their constituents (as they were elected to do), and recognize that it's very rare if not impossible for people to have a candidate that they agree on 100% of the time. I also recognize that they are still American citizens and their own individual person, and that they have a right to both their personal opinion and to say it. I may not like what they have to say, but to be an official or public servant in any capacity, in my own opinion, does not mean that one has to give up one's own opinions. 

>I would juxtapose that to say abortion. Which has not seen much flux in public support.

I don't know where you stand on abortion as a personal stance, but I agree with you that public support is more or less unchanged. I like Pew Research polls, and they have support for ""most or all cases"" at 61%, and I think the government should reflect that (admittedly as a pro-choice person myself). I do, however, have no problem with any public official taking a pro-life stance in their personal realm or speaking from a personal platform, so long as they make sure to clarify which they are speaking from. If that makes sense. 

>When I say ‚Äúpublic funds siphoning‚Äù I‚Äôm talking about grift. Like Hunter Biden grifting. 

I do not think that I have nearly enough information to be able to comment on this. Many of the reports I have read have been damning; others have seemed to acquit; others point out that a lot of information is missing and/or not available to the public. I prefer to refrain from commenting on issues when I personally feel I do not have enough facts to make an accurate judgement, lest I find myself with the taste of my foot in my mouth in the future. I do, however, have many concerns at how easily conversations about political and public figures turn to their children in recent years. Sasha and Malia Obama and Barron Trump do not deserve the wrath and hatred they have gotten online, especially as they were/are First Family *children.* An investigation into adult children is justified; minor children are not; nor should we automatically associate guilt to the parent based on the child.  

As far as Tulsi in this regard, I have a lot of respect for some of her positions. I have a lot of concerns about others (nuclear energy is a large one). I also have some finance campaign questions dating back to her early run and monetary backing from her father, but I do not know enough to approve or disapprove, merely that she has a (very positive) record of refusing PAC money, and a long history of using personal/family money that is both commendable and hard to trace. I am very pro her stance on drugs, particularly expunging those who were sentenced for weed possession or personal use, as well as increasing access to rehab. As with many candidates and politicians, I would like to know more about her. 

Court packing is a valid concern. I am personally opposed to it, but also concerned about how partisan the court has become in recent years. I was not surprised but disappointed when Garland was not confirmed - I thought he was an exemplary choice of a relatively non-partisan judge with a history of good rulings. Scalia and Ginsburg were good friends because of respect and civility.

I also do not like the precedent it sets for any administration change. It both continues to absolve Congress of responsibility in legislating, encourages partisan judges, and makes it easier for the three branches of government to operate not as checks and balances, but personal weapons designed to frustrate the other side. I personally hope that the refusal to clarify remains nothing more than a threat against non-cooperation. 

Also, I'm sorry, did I miss something very large or have I just had an r/whoosh moment? Who is suggesting getting rid of the Senate? What on earth would that accomplish???"

1045,j3qg7g,"How would you feel about a universal healthcare system structured like the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, or Germany? (Trying to provide a wide variety of non-single payer options). 

Netherlands and Switzerland: entirely private health insurance market, highly-regulated drug prices, no copays for lowest income bracket or ""minimum"" package care (annual premium ‚Ç¨1400, \~ $1600, covers an annual GP + screening appointment, OBGYN, emergency care, ambulance, and prescriptions), plans increase from there to cover dental, vision, mental health, etc. 

Denmark: two-tier system, choice between two different types of health insurance groups, 1 and 2. Group two has access to specialists and GPs with copayments to cut down on waiting times for appointments and elective procedures. Can also purchase supplementary insurance for physical therapy, vision, dental, etc., at group one or two price points. 

Belgium: a public option with ability to purchase private insurance (either primary or supplementary). 

Germany: multi-tier option partially funded by employment, partially by taxes, partially out of pocket (except for lowest income bracket)."
1046,j3qg7g,"I agree with you that politicians should represent their constituents.

My point would only be that their is some hubris in thinking that only **you** can be that representative. If you don‚Äôt hold views popular enough to get your elected I don‚Äôt think you should change your positions (publicly but not privately) I think you should bow out and let more representative people take the reigns.

I would argue most people aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdogmatic‚Äù about their politicians opinions at least on the right. The left has in the last 20 years implemented more and more purity tests if you ask me.

Take for instance my state (KY). We have in our two senate seats Rand Paul, a libertarian leaning Republican very much not establishment and McConnell the very definition of GOP establishment. The same electorate voted in the two people on drastic ends of the Republican Party.

I think fundamentally this is a difference of opinion on wether elected officials should represent their constituents as a populist or should politicians hold sincere beliefs and get elected *because* they represent their constituents beliefs.

I think the second system is much better. Maybe you disagree there? Regardless I don‚Äôt think our system should be pure democracy with extra steps.

To the minor children of politicians I agree they are off limits. I wasn‚Äôt aware of the Obama girls being attacked. But I think both the attacks on them and Barron are pretty fringe and not accepted in the mainstream.

Adult children are a different story. I wouldn‚Äôt begrudge anyone attacking them for legitimate issues.

To the Hunter Biden issue he did an interview and in his own words said he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten his cushy job if not for being a Biden. I think that is pretty damning. Especially taking that in context with the rest of his business dealings.

To tulsi and court packing I agree. Even on Garland I don‚Äôt think he was a terrible pick I think the issue was entirely political and in McConnells mind at least retaliation against Senate Democrats for shredding norms (filibuster and amendment rules for Obamacare) and ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù.

To the Senate thing that and the EC have been getting passed around in the opinion sections. If court packing is anything to go off of it is to change Democratic public opinion that those things are bad.

1048,j3qg7g,"Yeah, I'm already on that subreddit. Edit: I got into the lore first and plan on getting a Blood Angel army."
1049,j3qg7g,">If you don‚Äôt hold views popular enough to get your elected I don‚Äôt think you should change your positions (publicly but not privately) I think you should bow out and let more representative people take the reigns. \[...\] I think the second system is much better. Maybe you disagree there? 

I think I may have misrepresented my own belief a little bit, so let me clarify. I acknowledge that no politician is going to be 100% in agreement with me on all issues. Public policy encompasses such a wide variety of topics, especially at the federal level where both domestic and international issues have to be discussed/debated/represented, that I'm willing to go with someone who is in accordance with my views on the *majority* of topics. An example (returning briefly to your abortion point) would be, say, John Kerry when he was a senator for MA. It is an overwhelmingly pro-choice state, and Kerry advocated for that position in the Senate, although he himself is pro-life due to his Catholic beliefs. I do not think that, in the senatorial race, the residents of MA would have found another candidate that represented their positions on everything else - Social Security, union rights, gun control, capital punishment, NAFTA, climate change, same sex marriage - and were happy that he was representing their pro choice position regardless of his own personal beliefs.

I think you've touched on this briefly in your comment about purity tests: I want to elect someone that has strongly held beliefs, yes. If they're the candidate that matches most closely with my own beliefs and they will advocate for the policies that the majority of the state support even if they disagree, I don't think it's hiding a personal stance in order to get elected. I think it's recognizing that no candidate is perfect. I was (and still am) a big Pete Buttigieg supporter. I don't agree with him on every single issue, but he most closely aligned with my beliefs out of everyone in the Democratic primary. 

Likewise, in regards to McConnell and Rand Paul, I acknowledge that in many ways (especially economic policy, last I checked) they are very different. However, they share very similar opinions on things I *imagine* would be important to the people of Kentucky. For example, they are both generally opposed to gun control legislation and favor broad interpretations of the Second Amendment. They both seek or have sought to repeal the ACA/Obamacare. They are both anti abortion. They both have strong positions on border security and curtailing illegal immigration at the border, although they differ in their stances on non-criminal deportation. They both oppose the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. I think that many people in Kentucky *likely* prioritize the issues in which they are similar rather than the ones in which they differ (particularly 2A, ACA, and abortion, as those are hot button issues for a lot of voters) and thus are okay with voting for them both. 

However, Rand Paul in particular has in some way divorced his personal stance on LBGT issues from how he represents them in Congress. He has a very libertarian take on LGBT rights, but in accordance with public support in Kentucky, showed support for Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act and First Amendment Defense Act. Although his stance at the federal level is often presented as anti-LGBT protection, and from a personal point of view I do see that issue, he is equally libertarian on the question of heterosexual marriage and supports a marriage-neutral federal tax policy. That, to me, illustrates his vote in support of Indiana reflecting his constituents rather than his own personal view.

> To the Hunter Biden issue he did an interview and in his own words said he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten his cushy job if not for being a Biden. 

I suppose I just don't really see how this is fundamentally different from all the other examples of nepotism we are surrounded by in daily life. People with powerful and/or wealthy families get admitted to good universities and get good jobs. David Benioff got into Hollywood because his dad used to be the CEO of Goldman Sachs. George W Bush got into politics because his dad was president. The adult Trump children have positions in the administration of their father. Carrie Fisher got into Hollywood because her mother was Debbie Reynolds. Rand Paul got into politics because his father did. Tulsi got into politics because she had a leg up from the political activism of her father. The entire Kennedy family. People with connections and/or money will always be prioritized over those who do not.  

>If court packing is anything to go off of it is to change Democratic public opinion that those things are bad. Even though both are vital to the US republic.

I didn't hate Buttigieg's plan for SCOTUS reform. I think especially the procedure of having judges nominate one third of the other judges was a particularly good idea, because I hope it would remove some of the partisanship issues. I would not want it done by executive order, though. Constitutional Amendment or Congressional supermajority. I think my issue with the Senate, as it currently stands, is that the House has - for at least the past 10 years if not 20 - done a much better job of actually proposing legislation. The Senate seems to be where things go to die. I'm not sure why that is, but I understand people's frustration. It's also because although the Senate is built around the idea of states on equal footing, representation wide, the House is no longer proportional to states' population, yet there is no public support for expanding the House (28% for, 51% against, remainder undecided). Thus, it feels as though there are two chambers of unequal representation. 

Copy pasted from another conversation I had on the EC, which I am very torn about as it currently exists, and is relevant to your point on direct democracy: 

>Would it be a fair representation of your opinion regarding a popular vote vs EC to say that the representations of ""the majority"" are not depicted the same way? Like it's easy for 61% of Americans to see why the EC is unfair because it weights some votes more heavily than others. Why should a vote in Wyoming be worth three in California?  
>  
>On the other hand, I think there's a lot of ignorance coastally about what the ""rural vote"" represents outside of its people. Fail to have a legislature that represents the voting interest of farmers accurately, and within a few years food policy has been decimated.

The reason I grapple with this is because representing rural areas that do a lot to produce food, power, and some manufacturing is important. However, I am also deeply empathetic to people who are living in an area for economic opportunity knowing that their vote would be better represented in our government if they lived somewhere else. I am pro-EC reform but not abolishment."

Instead...you decided to ""hijack"" top comment to make an assertion about something that isn't correct.

Maybe you think you are super special for dying on this hill for us.

But you already died on the hill, because there are already red flag laws in some states.

Crenshaw wants to ensure that if they happen, people get a lawyer and the case is heard by a judge."
1221,hf616r,"We have to compromise here and there to get ahead. The party is dying. Destiny, a partisan hack, had a few good policy ideas when it came to guns. For example, people with mental illness can not own a gun and people who‚Äôve committed misdemeanors can not own guns either. Red flags, as controversial as they are, we need them. The best way to keep it in check is to put in place conservative judges. Republicans need to stay in the conversation."

1231,hf616r,"No.  I've been reading his thoughts on red flag laws for awhile now.

This isn't backpedaling.  This is explanation.

He is saying, ""Red flag laws already exist in some states and they WILL be pushed in more states and we will end up with really restrictive red flag laws that do NOT allow people due process unless we join the conversation about how to make them RESPECT due process."""
1232,hf616r,"I'd rather take no red flag laws, thank you."

You morons are just as bad as the progressive left if you cant see that.  He overwhelmingly supports guns and gun owners but you guys will continue to lie about him on here.  Thats what good leaders do, they take input from all people to make the best informed decision.  You all want to play only on party lines and its pretty pathetic.

1276,hf616r,"In case you missed it, I'm the one here taking flak for discussing the idea that I think we have a situation in this nation where there are fringe cases where a person isn't safe to own guns, but can't be jailed for anything and can't be institutionalized.

And in those rare, fringe cases..we need to think about how we approach it.

Because these rare fringe cases have led to some shootings.

When you talk about mental illness, you need to be SUPER careful, too because you do not want to DISCOURAGE people from getting treatment and if people think they will lose their ability to protect themselves, they may not get treatment and their condition will get worse.

>I think people who have gun related misdemeanors should not be able to own a firearm.

You said all misdemeanors.

If someone is arrested and has a small amount of weed, and also has a gun...should they lose their rights?"

Change my mind.

See...I absolutely DO fear red flag laws being abused.  I also think there are times when they weren't used.

If the person who poses a threat with their guns is given a lawyer and a judge hears the case for removing the guns, I tend to think that this is better protection for gun owners than exists now."
1280,hf616r,He wants due process respected.

1282,hf616r,"High school dropout? Lol
You don't know that BLET is associate's to Bachelor's  level of school and requires a high school diploma? 

Hard fact about life: it's always about resources.

 Even lives are about resources. Funny thing, in the old days we had Personnel Departments. Now every left wing corporation has Human Resources departments. Resources are either renewable or nonrenewable. All resources are expendable. 

So unarmed men have been shot 25 times in hundreds of instances by law enforcement? Over what time period? 
I'd love to see your sources on that."
1283,hf616r,That's certainly a good way to start the conversation.
1284,hf616r,"Free healthcare?  Very libertarian of you.

There is only SO much that mental health providers can do.

Due to the ACLU, you can't call someone crazy and lock them up.

So we tend to medicate and ask people to see a doctor frequently.

But not everyone is going to be compliant with their medication.

You are the one who just insisted here, that Nikolas Cruz' guns weren't legal.

Some 2A activist.  You didn't even know.

Yes... they were legal.

It's not about ""punishing someone for crimes not committed""... 

It's about looking at a situation and saying, ""This is still a problem.""

Leaving guns in the hands of people showing signs of being in danger of using them for illegal purposes...that's something we need to take a look at.

And some states already have laws in place.

Crenshaw says that these laws need to respect the gun owner by giving them legal representation and ensuring that a judge makes the decision."
1285,hf616r,"I'm very pro 2A.

But as I said in another comment.

Nicholas Cruz should never have been allowed to own guns."
1286,hf616r,"Well, what's my answer supposed to be when you go all ""I'm actually DOING something ...""

Like... tales you tell on the internet.

I vote for 2A friendly politicians?

That a good answer?

also WTF is with a brand new account similar to the one I already responded to?"
1287,hf616r,"I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm torn on that example. Part of me says yes and part of me says no. I am for full legalization and taxation of all drugs. However, if the person is in possession of a drug that is illegal it‚Äôs probably best to assume the firearm is also illegal and then the charges are a felony. I think it‚Äôs best to sit down state by state and look at the present laws. Go through the types of misdemeanors and weed the illogical ones for gun ownership prohibition out. This is not a simple question and you will not get a simple answer. To solve the mental illness situation that‚Äôll require amending the constitution thanks to the Supreme Court."

1291,hf616r,"I mean, it's literally negotiable through amendments. There are already a lot of them. They were negotiated."
1292,hf616r,We've ceded ground for far too long. It's time to take some back. Conservatives need to fight to take it back. Quit being spineless
1293,hf616r,"And since when was the state ANY effective in assessing and judging those situations?

Do you trust the government, red or blue, to look at you and solely decide whether you are a threat or not based on a prediction of human actions?

Good luck when people say that opinionated conservatives bearing guns are a real danger and the media endorses it 24/7 until it becomes a crime.

And if you come with the argument that this  would never happen in US, just look at Seattle where a bunch of thugs and maniacs literally declared independence in american soil and the government supports them.

Don't give the state permission for violations you won't be able to fight back in the future."
1294,hf616r,Except he wasn‚Äôt. He was underage and it didn‚Äôt matter if there was a red flag law or not. It wasn‚Äôt legal regardless. Also can you seriously suggest that you an ‚Äúactual conservative‚Äù as your flair says that government should limit gun ownership? You‚Äôre not very pro 2A. You‚Äôre very pro gun confiscation. Don‚Äôt pretend you care about guns when you don‚Äôt want to even examine the facts of your own damn example.
1295,hf616r,"> However, if the person is in possession of a drug that is illegal it‚Äôs probably best to assume the firearm is also illegal 

What?"
1296,hf616r,"> He wasn't legally allowed to shoot someone unless it was for self defense.

And yet....

He shot a lot of people WITH a legal gun.

That he shouldn't have had if you look at his police history."

1377,atkbwd,r/funny is the same way too. 
1378,atkbwd,"*till it's law

1380,atkbwd,Funny! 
1381,atkbwd,"Wanna know somethin‚Äô about r/politicalhumor, everybody?

It‚Äôs a joke!

*badum tsssss*"
1382,atkbwd,I got downvoted for having an opinion. AMA
1383,atkbwd,I like to sort r/politicalhumor by new and just go on a downvote frenzy 
1384,atkbwd,"Same. I think it should be renamed r/democratshumor
Most of their posts are unfunny and would fit on r/comedycemetery 
Not democrat=instant downvote"
1385,atkbwd,"The only humor sub without any humor.

My 97 year old childhood school librarian had more humor than that sub."
1386,atkbwd,not even close compared to your political party.
1387,atkbwd,Also r/news or r/worldnews
1388,atkbwd,What do you think of r/environment? A lot of people there seem to think AOC's deal is pure gold and flawless from what I've seen.
1389,atkbwd,"But he actually didn‚Äôt make fun of the disabled reporter which is the best part, but hey, they‚Äôll believe what they (the media) wants them to believe üòÇüòÇ"
1390,atkbwd,LMAO!
1391,atkbwd,"I was on a train in England last year and teenager sat down across from us. Once he found out we were from America he went on this long rant about how evil and racist America is. Trying to change the subject we told him we were from Tennessee, so he began telling us how the South was even worse than the rest of America. I couldn't believe the lack of common manners."
1392,atkbwd,They sleep under the blanket of protection which we provide but they question the manner in which we provide it
1393,atkbwd,Thanks!! As far an international standpoint r/geopolitics is pretty good IMO. They stay pretty neutral and if anything lean very slightly right.
1394,atkbwd,"Yep, although they are still somewhat bias left, there‚Äôs no real avoiding that on reddit. "
1395,atkbwd,But still the r/politics people are worse than the comments I see on msnbc Facebook posts. Just full blown AOC libs 
1396,atkbwd,I agree 1000%
1397,atkbwd,Good luck friend! 
1398,atkbwd,"The sub may be a joke but the posts never are. r/leftistcirclejerk would be a more appropriate name for that sub. 

Shameless plug for r/ShitPoliticsSays if you want a little sanity in your day. I don't mod it or anything, it's just one of my favorite subs and I try to tell people about it whenever it seems relevant. "

1412,atkbwd,The truth
1413,hfog0h,"Democrat here, not posting this to start trouble I just wanted to let you all know that I respect your viewpoints and don‚Äôt automatically disagree with things you folks say just bc you‚Äôre Republicans!

1417,hfog0h,it‚Äôs so much easier to come out as gay than being a republican
1418,hfog0h,[removed]
1419,hfog0h,This applies to every line of thinking. Don‚Äôt just believe in certain thing because a certain group or individual tell you so. Apply your own thoughts and reasoning behind a every topic.
1420,hfog0h,"I‚Äôm a democrat I think republicans are needed and great, I don‚Äôt understand why people on my side think if someone doesn‚Äôt agree with everything it makes them terrible. The Republican Party is needed to keep this country sane in my opinion.-so yeah thanks for being Republicans"
1421,hfog0h,"this is actually really important, it is one of the main reason America is so fucked politically speaking (insert rant about American voting system here). the news outlets of both sides (the big ones being CNN and Fox) rarely argue how their side is doing something good, but just go ""the other side is bad, so vote for us"".

this has been the perspective of a leftie from Switzerland."

1425,hfog0h,And they refuse to realize it. That‚Äôs the worst part.
1426,hfog0h,It does a person well to think through every important political stance they hold and to evaluate which party brings them closer to their moral ideals
1427,hfog0h,"Can confirm, at school we were once discussing the impeachment thing and I mentioned that a lot of tax money goes into those investigations that find nothing. The teacher said I was ‚Äúoff topic‚Äù and continued talking about what trump was accused of"
1428,hfog0h,I never liked Trump before all this nonsense corona shit started. But the fact that a volcano could go off and people would still blame trump for it really pisses me off. I‚Äôve asked people point blank why they don‚Äôt like him and never get a real answer other than he says stupid stuff. Um yeah so? Biden said you ain‚Äôt black if you vote for Trump soooooo ü§î
1429,hfog0h,Which is really odd. I mainly see republicans as trying to get info from the other side. But nope we're the devil
1430,hfog0h,I can‚Äôt stop laughing. So much truth in a simple comic.
1431,hfog0h,"I'm a proud conservative, but man it's ANNOYING to have people tell me why I'm wrong and racist,sexist, homophobic, and all these other bullshit terms all the time. Shows their ignorance, I suppose.

1433,hfog0h,Amen everyone at school Teacher ask if there was any trump supporters I was the only one and racist for 3 weeks
1434,hfog0h,"Ask a leftist to list what's wrong with republicans and you'll find a trove of stupidity. A LOT of the left think we all get together on Friday night and lynch a poc. A LOT of them think we wish the good old days would come back around so we can own a few poc. A LOT of them think every law is used to hold down poc. They've been told this crap forever by their libtard professors, the MSM, their fellow travelers. It would (almost) be forgiveable except for their inability to see their own lies and hipocracy. Juan Williams is a great example. He was canned by his libtard network and was bailed out by Fox, who gave him a gig. He's still spouting the same insane crap even after he was eaten by his own ilk! The left has been told that republicans/ conservatives (not necessarily the same thing at all) are the Devil's toejam for so long they'll swallow anything."
1435,hfog0h,Ima be the asshole and say both parties are shit
1436,hfog0h,This is so pathetically true.
1437,hfog0h,One of the most annoying things is when leftists want to ban Fox news for being propaganda
1438,hfog0h,"This is pretty good.
And I'm not even republican."
1439,hfog0h,Haha the way I read it in my mind made it sound like a comedy skit. Much love to all the conservative subs keeping my hope alive in humanity.
1440,hfog0h,So true!!
1441,hfog0h,Stupid Democrats.
1442,hfog0h,Factss

1444,hfog0h,"Republic: Ultimate power is to its people (first in it's definition) AND (or ""then"") its elected representatives. 

Democracy: Proletariats elect a ruling class

[Edit: pigeons say coo]"
1445,hfog0h,"Hi! I‚Äôm not saying anything about republicans in general, but (at least on Twitter) the general argument of a Trump supporter is actually ‚Äúwell your just brainwashed‚Äù.

1466,hfog0h,It‚Äôs in both sides
1467,hfog0h,This works both ways though
1468,hfog0h,"Republicans aren't bad, but the beliefs are dangerous. Religious influence in government, blind unquestionable patriotism, and a movement against modern science.  
However, The Democrat agenda to expand government powers can be just as dangerous! There's always negatives to look at when you focus on them. 

 However there are situations rising where expanding federal government control is becoming a necessary evil (covid and climate change) and the longer we wait to act, the bigger the Big Government is going to have to be. 

Note: I'm a registered Dem, but I'd vote Larry Hogan for a third term if I could."
1469,hfog0h,Fox News does the same thing with Democrats.
1470,hfog0h,"Im not gonna say all Republicans are, but the majority is trash people. Republican leadership in the last 4 years turned US into shitshow the whole world laughs at. Whole world Is laughing and is disgusted at the same time, that a big chunk of people in wealthiest country in the world is made of uneducated racists, that eat the shit their pro rich government feeds, while at the same time milkin the shit out of poorest people"

1473,hfog0h,"Sorry but again. Respectfully, when one party makes decisions based on science and the other on favours for their donors. Which one should you support?

I‚Äôm saying this in good faith! I don‚Äôt think republicans are bad people, I don‚Äôt want anyone to die either."
1474,hfog0h,"The only one of those institutions that actually says things like Republicans Bad are rock bands.

Im openly conservative but nto an asshole, I make jokes about left v right stereotypes, and I sometimes actually engage in political discusion, no one seems to hate me yet and others have told me theyre closeted and scared so ive made a few like-minded friends just by being open

Sometimes when a friend finds out its weird, but im compassionate while also being forward and open so I use those moments to share perspectives so they know im not the boogieman they might think.

Id say come out and if they dont want anything to do with you, why would you want anything to do with them?"
1490,hfog0h,I hung a Trump 2020 flag next to my American flag. I live in a small town in Massachusetts.

I suppose people just don‚Äôt get it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a free country‚Äù they say.

1497,hfog0h,I will never understand why people are so upset over this either. I‚Äôm not republican but I also am not a registered Democrat either. I just don‚Äôt understand why people aren‚Äôt more open minded and just except people even if they have different views.

Shut up.   Have a different, nuanced, version of opinion?  Shut up.  And now, we hate you too because YOU are a purveyor of hate.   

I've lost several black friends because I didn't immediately sign on to the lie of 'hands up, don't shoot' and because while I agree that Black Lives Matter (Too), I cannot have anything to do with BLM^TM , the group as they are avowed and admitted marxists only looking to take down the country.   All the friends I had suddenly are spewing racist hate towards me and telling me **I** am the racist hater.

Hate sells, are you buying?"

1513,hfog0h,"No, not a lot of them. I mean sure a lot in number, but  in percentage not so much.

We need to unite, from left to right. We are on The same side and we get played against each other. But we have common enemies, and ultimately, at least for conservatives and progressives who have good intentions in mind (so overwhelming majority), we want to have the same goal. We all know The system is crooked and media, which reddit counts for aswell,  are playing us like a fiddle. Trump wanted to drain the swamp, but he alone is not enough. This is the reason we need to unite and take back our land and freedom and dignity."

1531,hfog0h,I don't see liberals losing their jobs for disagreeing with conservatives.
1532,hfog0h,"People that say there is religious influence in the government are just against Christian influence and turn a blind eye to other religions having influence in government.  Unquestionable patriotism to the Nation, not the government.  'modern science' is moving further away from actual science.

""We need to give more power to the government for our own good"" is crazy."
1533,hfog0h,give some examples of these claims.
1534,hfog0h,"The numbers are not as simple and clear as you posit when you infer ""all."". Some 72 percent, if memory serves me right, of young republicans believe in human effect on climate change.  Other Republicans believe it is serious but within that group some believe it is human-caused, some  nature-driven, and some believe it is a combination. And then there are the it's not happening crowd, which I don't get either.

Probably the biggest issue is the solution.  I do not understand why all of the climate solution liberal talk about fail to also play up the innovative solutions offered by inventors, entrepreneurs and innovators, all in the capitalistic private sector.  We don't even advance tree planting as is done elsewhere.  We don't even read of alternative solutions in the media. 

I also would like to suggest you move beyond what the liberal media writes about Republicans.  I would hate myself if I believed as they paint me. 

If you write only about the weak thinkers in either party, you tend to believe they are all.

Read some articles online about how we agree or about those who immersed themselves in our world and changed their minds. Interesting experiences."
1535,hfog0h,"Ah, the party that says more taxes will make the earth colder / going to a riot won't spread the virus, but going to church will.  It's idiotic."
1536,hfog0h,You're wasting your time coming to r/republican just to start trouble instead of spending your time trying to make money so you don't have to beg a government you're #resisting for money?  lol.
1537,hfog0h,That's fine. You'll die angry and bitter. Alone and unloved. With gaudy unnaturally colored hair cut in a horribly ugly style. Nobody will care that you're gone because you're ugly inside. You'll never experience any real joy or happiness in your life because you're full of hate and bitterness and self loathing. It's very pitiful and sad. I pity you.
1538,hfog0h,"""I wish more people didn't confront me for my worst beliefs"""
1539,hfog0h,Yup. We are actually in a class war and we share The same enemy
1540,hfog0h,That's why I'm a libertarian :D
1541,hfog0h,"Same. At the end of the day, Democrats and Republicans want the same thing, a great America. We just have different opinions on how to achieve it."
1542,hfog0h,">Hell, the man even went to a Trump rally with me.

Now that's committing to a relationship!"
1543,hfog0h,"I guarantee it varies, but most people that identify as being a democrat and are also extreme leftist are the ones mass posting all over the internet about the statues needing to be destroyed. People in the middle but maybe still are Democrats don't really speak about it since they'll be immediately labelled as a racist and their careers could be destroyed by people online hate messaging their bosses etc (a coworker tried to get me fired for example, because I didn't post anything for 2 days into the movement while I tried to gather my mental health first to focus). 

Honestly I've started being able to pick out people's political view through all of this if they're on social media. Extreme leftists are attacking people online who ""don't do good enough"", get mad at any normal posts that aren't about the movement, and post trump-hitler comparisons. Far right are posting the George Floyd challenge, making jokes about killing black people (n words), or posting blue lives/all lives matter. Then those who aren't easily swayed by media and try to think for themselves aren't posting much, maybe a few things here and there attempting to show that they do care."
1544,hfog0h,"So in the last 2 dacades we have seen an assymetrical polarization. Democrats have remained relatively unchanged in their politics, while in studies and surveys the average Republican beliefs have moved more to the right. Most Democrats exist in the center left sphere that means they probably dont support statutes of presidents being torn down. The tearing down of statues has been from a section of America that has felt like the actions they have taken in the last 20 years have not been effective, like peaceful protesting has not resulting in meaningful change.

This is a problem that Bestof suffers from, IMO.  There is a genre of upvoted posts that go towards ‚Äúso and so explains the true motives of Republicans who vote for Trump‚Äù.   The post in question then just goes on to say it‚Äôs because they are stupid/racist/controlled/sheeple or some other sweeping calumny.

That is no way to talk about any ethnic group, or really any group of people.  In bad faith, it assumes the worst of a person.  It denies the legitimacy of their complaints, and agency in their actions.  The problem is problem is Bestof would never talk like this about any ethnic group, but it seems susceptible to this attitude about Republicans or people who disagree with them.  

For example, if I vote for Trump this time around,  my reasoning will likely be that I really don‚Äôt like Biden‚Äôs VP pick.  I also want to keep government divided.  Specifically I want to prevent a worst case of Democrat controlled executive and legislative branches.  My hope is if government stays split long enough then they‚Äôll realize they have to work together to pass bills.  Where is the racism in that?  Or am I too stupid to know what my interests are?  Or is it just my malicious spirit that animates me.

I'd argue that many left wingers oppose the fundamental cornerstones of right wing ideology more than any perceived theocratic ideology. IE: The fundamental assertion of a natural hierarchy of social class. ie: We are better than you and know what is best for you. Whilst continually proving that..no.. no they don't. What they know is how to make themselves and their cronies rich(er) at the expense of the taxpayer.

What is amazing is that establishment right wing governments manage to get voted in time and time again globally.

How? How do a very select amount of incredibly wealthy, self confessed better-than-you social elite keep getting voted in by the great unwashed masses, generally against their own interests? Tax cuts for the mega rich? Trickle down economics? Billion/Trillion dollar boondoggles to drain federal funds that could be used on more socially minded projects?

Well, it ain't simple. Gerrymandering, voter suppression and control of media are the more obvious culprits. It also helps that the party that's sole purpose is to make the mega rich even richer..surprise surprise... has quite a lot of financial clout. But still, even these aren't enough to get the common man to vote against their own interest.. so instead how do these parties retain the rabid fanaticism? Actually, that part is simple, they nail their colours to nationalism. Ergo, an enemy of this party is obviously an enemy of this nation. Stir the pot, keep them divided, keep them fighting each other so they don't have time to question why the elite are wholesale looting the country.

All of this requires ""an enemy"" for us to unite with in our hatred. Immigrants! Dey turk yer jerb! Poor people! How dare they put such a drain on your tax dollars, they're all criminals anyway! Marxists! They literally spend every waking moment seething with rage at our capitalist utopia! They hate you for being you!! So why don't you hate them back?  Its all so much bullshit it sickens me and it is EVERYWHERE.

Some notes/info - Am not American. Not affiliated with any party in either American politics or my own country. Am also fully aware that there are awful and decent people on all sides of this. But ideologically I absolutely identify as a  lefty.

People protesting frequent injustices is an important part of a free society. Would you not thing the outrage is justified?

1637,hfog0h,"I this what he was trying to say is that the mob is vandalizing statues that weren‚Äôt Jim Crow era statues or don‚Äôt represent racism like Abraham Lincoln or Ulysses Grant. Not saying you necessarily condone these actions but this is what the mob is currently doing. I guess most republicans are advocating for a democratic and legal way of removal. In the case of southern heratige, I do sympathize with these people whose past is demonized and idols. Now, I was raised in the south but I‚Äôm a Mexican who currently resides in Mexico. I understand how this can be viewed as glorifying racists (not in the case of Lee and Longstreet, who I think should be glorified) and also as being prideful of your past. I guess democracy should decide (I‚Äôm also against mob rule but this seems the fairest choice for me). 

I also have to say that racism isn‚Äôt institutionalized since the civil rights movement. I guess this is the topic we disagree the most. There isn‚Äôt a US law that directly and explicitly targets minorities. I say explicitly because there are laws and policies that affect disproportionately minorities, but I do not think the majority have racist intent under them.

In the case of racism, I like to use two factor to determine who racist a society is. One is interracial couples, which has been on a steady rise. And two is social backlash towards racism. I will tell you this, social backlash because of racism and bigotry is the strongest in the US. Just look at the social outcry because of George Floyd. Only Canada, the UK, and maybe Sweden could compare to the US strong social taboo of racism.

I think most of this sub agrees on police brutality. It‚Äôs a horrible thing but most of us do not think provoked because of racism. In the case of George, there were 2 white cops but the other two were minorities. One Samoan and another Asian. Look at the cases of Daniel Shaver

And Tony Timp. These victims were both white. And most of us also believe some shootings were justified such as the Micheal Brown shooting (He assault the officer by punching him in the jaw 2 times and trying to grab his gun. Later he charged at the officer, were he was shot multiple times. Autopsies by the justice department and a 3rd party medical professional confirms that he was shot in the front, this also coincides with multiple witnesses reports).

In a sense, our ideologies both recognized the problem but acted in different ways to try and fix it. Most of us support the peaceful protests (or what‚Äôs left of them, most protests in major cities turned into riots) and what they have done (we support the first amendment). We just wished it was more peaceful, legal and didn‚Äôt provoke racial tensions.

I suppose I'll take you up on that offer. Can you please elaborate on how it is more difficult to ""come out"" as a Republican as compared to coming out as gay? Like I said, Republicans control the majority of government and around half of the population (give or take some) is Republican. I know there is a general disdain for Republicans in many areas, same as there is a general disdain for Democrats in different areas, but by and large there isn't a systematic oppression of the group. There aren't camps you can get sent to for ""conservative conversion therapy.""

To be fair, I'm a solid liberal (got here from Popular), so I'm not as familiar with those who lean right as I perhaps should be. Of course I understand that if you're sorrounded by people who hate Republicans than it would be difficult to tell those people that you are a Republican.

I am merely pointing out that there was a supreme court decision last week about whether or not it was legal to fire someone for being gay and when Republicans didn't get their way mainstream conservatives across the country were absolutely furious. Not to mention what right leaning people on this site were saying.

To be clear here, Republicans were furious that people could no longer discriminate. Discriminate against people for a trait that is out of their control.

Remember a couple years back conservatives made Kim Davis and the baker that refused service to gay people as folk heroes? I do.

You guys are ignoring reality and painting yourselves the victims. It's a fascinating to me and seemingly one of the only things that holds conservatives in the US together."
1649,hfog0h,"No, it literally says NOTHING about Democrats."
1650,hfog0h,"One of my favorite quotes from Malcolm X:

""The liberal elements of whites are those who have perfected the art of selling themselves to the Negro as a friend of the Negro. Getting sympathy of the Negro, getting the allegiance of the Negro, and getting the mind of the Negro. Then the Negro sides with the white liberal, and the white liberal use the Negro against the white conservative. So that anything that the Negro does is never for his own good, never for his own advancement, never for his own progress, he‚Äôs only a pawn in the hands of the white liberal. The worst enemy that the Negro have is this white man that runs around here drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros, and calling himself a liberal, and it is following these white liberals that has perpetuated problems that Negros have. If the Negro wasn‚Äôt taken, tricked, or deceived by the white liberal then Negros would get together and solve our own problems. I only cite these things to show you that in America the history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be solved by the white man. The only way that our problem will be solved is when the black man wakes up, clean himself up, stand on his own feet and stop begging the white man, and take immediate steps to do for ourselves the things that we have been waiting on the white man to do for us. Once we do for self then we will be able to solve our own problems"""

1652,hfog0h,"Woah, Woah, Woah... We're not talking about clean water and toxic substances.  We're talking about changing the temperature of the earth.  Climate change has been both global cooling and global warming with dozens of doomsday dates that have come and gone... and that's just in my lifetime.  So why should I not be skeptical?  The ""hockey stick"" chart was proven false.  The ""97% consensus"" has an asterisk next to it.  Every science experiment HAS to have a control group and there's not a lab on earth big enough to fit another earth in it... it's basic science.

1654,hfog0h,I agree with most of this besides the mentioning of the race of officers in the George Floyd incident. I don‚Äôt believe that minorities are immune to the underlying racial division in America. I believe those officers in the George Floyd incident were on the wrong side of this division.
1655,hfog0h,Yeah you said what I was trying to say a lot better
1656,hfog0h,">vandalizing statues that weren‚Äôt Jim Crow era statues

It is a pissed off large group of people - they are going to get stuff wrong. They were also peacefully protesting in Lafayette Square when they were gassed for no reason recently so people are fired up.  Some eggs are going to get broken here. Are we OK with them taking down Jim Crow era statues? Because that is the bulk of what they are doing but I still hear grumbling.
Ideally they would only take down relevant statues - I agree. 

>I guess most republicans are advocating for a democratic and legal way of removal.

The democratic and legal way of removing them has been available for decades yet they still stand. Police brutality has existed for decades yet the proposed legal reforms are a joke (latest Rep bill discouraging but not banning choke holds? When the whole country is protesting...)
When the system is rigged, you can't play by the system.
Ideally, you are right and I agree with you but all the evidence shows the legal way isn't working. 


>I also have to say that racism isn‚Äôt institutionalized since the civil rights movement

Just magically fixed? Equality for all since the 60s? Lots of people disagree with that. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism



>One is interracial couples, which has been on a steady rise

Yes this is encouraging. Is this uniform across the US? Rural and urban? I think there are still definite pockets of racism in many areas of the US. 

>I think most of this sub agrees on police brutality.

The most progress ever is being made right now because of protests and the police response has been disgusting. I agree with you that police brutality affects blacks and whites but I think it affects blacks even more because of policing policies. 

>Even so, I have to recognize your courage for coming here. It really takes some balls to do this. I appreciate you sharing your thoughts. I think I speak on behalf of everyone one that you‚Äôre welcomed here any time you want.

Aw gosh. That is nice. Thanks! Usually I just get banned in conservative subs for saying anything."
1657,hfog0h,"Statues are erected to celebrate heroes - they are not accidental - they are deliberate actions to honor people. The society then sees those statues in public places everyday. Their story and their legacy lives on because of the statue. Whose hero is it? Not PoC and not the average American. Keeping the statue there is just honoring something that we don't agree with. These are powerful symbols and if they are racist then they should go.

This is only one small step to fixing system and institutional racism but it is an important one.

1665,hfog0h,"Honestly I agree with the issue but I think youre giving too much credit to the people in power, theyre pretty incompetent

I think its a factor, but a small one. A bigger one is that hate and drama sells, so thats where media goes. We also live in bubbles in most areas so we are less likely to actually meet someone who disagrees with us, and most people arent that smart or articulate or empathetic or educated enough to really provide a better example. We also live in a literal utopia, given history, and I think our monkey brains need chaos, an enemy, a problem. Humanity is currently in the bored/frustrated adolescent stage.

We need individuals to explore the next stage of evolution and bring back some of that wisdom, and people are trying - but hate sells and twitters loud minority and 4chans devious nature drive up viewship of poor ideas and hate and trickery and the media will then lap that up, corperations will cater to those who yell, etc etc. 

We are new to technology and social media, and I dont think we know how to navigate it in a healthy way on a nation/global scale"
1666,hfog0h,"Well again, I never said its harder to come out as conservative overall. I could see the argument made depending on the community/location. Where I live, coming out is celebrated with love, acceptance, and understanding. If you mention being conservative - people often shut down and put up walls. Thats just *my* experience, and every other conservative ive met has felt like they cant express themselves without people hating them. I for sure know that in college I had to read the room - and the room was never open to conservative opinions. I dipped a toe here and there but I have not met a conservative who is celebrated or shown love and understanding when they reveal their political leanings.

I know ideology is different than sexuality, im not comparing them, just stating my experience

I agree, there is no systematic oppression of republicans. Any republican who says theyre oppressed is silly. That said, for the majority of the country im not sure how gay people are systematically oppressed either - im very open to learning more though"
1667,hfog0h,"My bad, I hadnt realized you were someone else

What was the supreme court decision? I hadnt heard of it, certainly non of the mainstream conservatives I listen to talked about it that I heard of. I hate that its like this but I would have to look into the story and look at ""the other side"" cuz it seems liberals and conservatives often misunderstand eachother

The cake situation was one of those, im 100 percent for artists being able to choose which projects they pick up, its not that the baker wouldnt make them a cake, but he wouldnt make them a cake the depicted/celebrated a gay wedding, and if I recall the couple was going around *looking* for someone to turn it down. But yeah, im a freelance animator - if you tried to hire me to make a 10 minute narration film about your transition ill likely turn it down, im just not interested in that project, I do other shit"

‚ÄúThe precedent for it happening in the past is not there‚Äù. [Greenhouse gasses ‚Äì mainly CO2, but also methane ‚Äì were involved in most of the climate changes in Earth‚Äôs past. When they were reduced, the global climate became colder. When they were increased, the global climate became warmer. When CO2 levels jumped rapidly, the global warming that resulted was highly disruptive and sometimes caused mass extinctions. Humans today are emitting prodigious quantities of CO2, at a rate faster than even the most destructive climate changes in earth's past.](https://skepticalscience.com/climate-change-little-ice-age-medieval-warm-period.htm)‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt just consensus between experts but also the [studies ](https://skepticalscience.com/argument.php). We have multiple controls. This very earth. We know the fluctuations of the past via ice cores. We have been able to accurately predict the changes and their effects.

We [are not heading to another ice age ](https://skepticalscience.com/heading-into-new-little-ice-age.htm). Numerous papers from the IPCC [demonstrate ](https://skepticalscience.com/ipcc-scientific-consensus.htm) the concerning nature of this change. If anything the real
Life changes have been worse than predictions.

This is how science works. We use past events and evidence along with other fundamental understandings of our natural world. It‚Äôs not a bad thing to ask questions and be a skeptic. It is when the evidence points one clear way and that skepticism becomes unreadable. 

Also yes of course people have the right to worship. Power to em. But just wait a little so the virus can go down!

What are you talking about illegals ? What has this to do with anything? I‚Äôm not the media stop straw manning. This isn‚Äôt really the subject we‚Äôre discussing anyway. Save it for later perhaps. I‚Äôd rather focus on one thing at a time do both of us can be concise."

Californians and the passage of Prop 57 didn't reclassify anything.

1854,im0v4q,"Interesting that you're clearly thinking of one specific case when there have been several incidents of this in the past 6 months alone. Not including the hundreds of incidents which didn't result in death, filmed and posted online since May. And if you want to bring up the protective order, that's fair game to bring up City of Castle Rock v. Gonzales. Either way, violation of a court order is not enough to justify execution, let alone execution without due process."
1855,im0v4q,"That's only ""if the victim has a vagina"". If the victim has a penis, it's legal as long as the victim is within 10 years of age of the rapist. Basically, it means that the rapist only sees court if the victim is anatomically female. I read the bill."

They were also called to the scene because he was there violating a restraining order after the pending warrant from his sexual assault of the woman of his children, him showing up in her home at 6am while she was sleeping with one of their kids, and where he subsequently stuck his fingers inside her, without consent, and said it smells like you‚Äôve been with other men. He knew he was going back to jail when the cops came and he resisted arrest / reached for something. I don‚Äôt feel bad that he no longer has movement for the parts of his body that he could use to violate women. I‚Äôm done with people excusing sexual assaulters."

I read lots of articles that I don't forward to friends or post on social media.

1886,im0v4q,"quote from u/ellabean17

 Those 39 kids were rescued over the course of a month across multiple cities. This is just worded to try any make it sound like there was some big bust in one place where they rescued dozens of kids from sex trafficking when the majority of them werent even being trafficked and it wasnt a singular event

Many news sources did in fact report on this story, despite what they're claiming. It's not the biggest story because it's really not a huge deal that a bunch of missing people, many of which being runaways who werent even missing for much longer than a month, were slowly located. Hundreds of thousands of kids go missing every year, most of which are runaways from bad conditions at home, and 97% of them are recovered. So 39 kids and 6 adults, 15 of which being involved in trafficking, isnt some super shocking and amazing thing when hundreds of thousands of other people are found every year"
1887,im0v4q,"Again, it wasn‚Äôt 39 kids in one big bust. It was over a month in multiple cities; Charlie Kirk‚Äôs tweet is very misleading. I agree it‚Äôs worth reporting on (and it was), but you act like every single good deed should get a weeks worth of national media attention. That doesn‚Äôt make sense. There literally wouldn‚Äôt be enough time in the day since there are people everywhere doing good work. 

The reason the protests/George Floyd are still in the news is because it‚Äôs a global movement for fair treatment by police that is still ongoing. It‚Äôs a very unique and current event that has a global impact. In the past, conservatives would have been concerned with tyranny by government officers (using words of the past - not saying that day to day there is tyranny for everyone), but now it seems to be no problem as long as the guy at the top is on the same team. Really disappointing."
1888,im0v4q,"George Floyd isn't still in the news, but the protests inspired by George Floyd, which are currently ongoing, are. Because they are still happening and thus are news."
1889,im0v4q,"It's called context. The OP is about this story not receiving coverage. You chimed in by saying this is because it the media can't use it to further division. I know you didn't literally say that the media refuses to cover it, but it's pretty obvious you're going along with the false ""they're not highlighting it for X or Y"" narrative."
1890,im0v4q,I love blue man group
1891,im0v4q,Who are these people who 'just hate cops'. Every person I've ever encountered on the subject has some pretty solid reasons why they hate the police as an entity and the cops as a part of that.

1893,im0v4q,"after he became President, Trump signed 2 executive orders in 2017 to unleash the Justice dept. on child traffickers and pedophiles and take their property. Arrests for these crimes have [skyrocketed](https://theblacksphere.net/2018/10/pedophile-arrests-soar-under-trump/) since.

These numbers are a year old.

The arrests of Epstein, Maxwell, Raneire, Mack and Bronfman (NXVIUM), Wienstein were federal sealed indictments that we would have never seen if Trump was not elected. The FBI also raided Peter Nygard's AKA [""the Canadian Epstein""](https://www.coreysdigs.com/trafficking/is-peter-nygard-the-canadian-jeffrey-epstein/) offices in NY.

The evidence is overwhelming that Trump is taking pedophiles and child traffickers down, not protecting them like the MSM and past administrations.

1914,im0v4q,It's MA'AM!
1915,im0v4q,"I'm not saying it's the biggest news of the year, but every single time a black man is killed by police, it takes up at least a day's news cycle, usually more than one day's. I think it's crazy that the nation will riot over criminals being killed, but will casually report on sex traffickers, not even making it the top story of the day.

You point to numbers. 9 unarmed black men killed by police over the course of last year is enough to spark national protests and riots. Lets say only 15 kids being trafficked over the course of a single month. I'm not saying that no news reported on it, but come on. The priorities of news outlets are messed up.

When someone is murdered, I'm fine with the news reporting on it, by the way. When a criminal points a gun at police, and is shot in response, I think it's bullshit that the news paints him as a saint who was brutally lynched.

I'd like to also point out that the 39 kids mentioned were a part of just one of the many rescues in recent times. So the number is much larger. The media may mention it, but the focus is clearly on sowing hatred and divide in our country, largely by making race relations worse."
1916,im0v4q,"The issue is that police are not running around murdering people like the news says. Conservatives don't see nine unarmed black men being killed in an entire year as proof of systematic racism and ""tyranny"". We aren't denying that there aren't instances of people being murdered by police, but it is not a national crisis.

The people killed last year didn't happen all at once. It was over a year in multiple states. The difference is that everyone has heard of Floyd, and relatively very few have heard of these children. And I'm not saying that good acts should be covered for weeks. I'm saying it's bullshit that the protests and riots are still being called the ""George Floyd Protests"" months after he died."
1917,im0v4q,"The media largely refers to the protests and riots as ""The George Floyd Protests"". The news may not be covering the day he died anymore, but he is still very much a part of the news. He is still being made the martyr of the movement."
1918,im0v4q,"Also. It isn't ""the media"" who highlights something. It's all of us. I we don't care about something, we don't state it and comment on it. Then it will not be a headline and would fade away."
1919,im0v4q,"Not what I was going for at all, but insert words I didn't say in order to prove your point. That's all you've done thus far. And you'll note he asked why isn't it the biggest story in America right now, I simply provided what I believe is the reason for it. Not my fault you simply read too far into what I said, and completely misunderstood my comment. Yet your big defense is context.

1926,im0v4q,"I respectfully disagree. The [raw video](https://youtu.be/K0DSTV7XT1E) is all that anybody needs to know that the shooting wasn‚Äôt justified. Sure, additional context is important when trying to properly charge a criminal, but not when an officer shoots anyone in the back. At that point, the officer is shooting based on assumption, and that‚Äôs not what civilians need. 

Lock Jacob Blake up for what he did, if he actually did it, but it‚Äôs important to note that this is simply about police not valuing human life. That needs to change. Let the court decide whether Jacob Blake should be executed. 

Idk what other stories there are about children, but if something similar is happening to them, then it should be broadcasted as well."

And the thing is you don't hear about them in the news, many weren't filmed or their story never caught on. Some names become representative of the much larger injustice faced by black people every day because they are they cases where we can see the evidence more clearly."
1932,im0v4q,"Yeah but the issue is that the news isn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúpolice are running around murdering people‚Äù either. If you can show me one mainstream news article that says that then I would be happy to consider it since that would be new information.  Realistically, your description is a hyperbolic pearl clutching narrative in the face of pretty fundamental/basic criticism that nobody should be in fear of police especially on the basis of race/religion/gender. The terrible reality is that this stuff has been happening for decades, particularly in the black community, and it is only this year that people have started to pay attention to it. 

Police reforms will benefit everyone in the long term, it‚Äôs not something to be fearful of. I don‚Äôt want anyone to have to talk to their kids about having to be super careful around police, not question anything, and just comply blindly without acknowledging their rights. That kind of fear/distrust of police will make it less likely for people to report crimes which doesn‚Äôt help anyone."
1933,im0v4q,"Yes, which is what is being covered. His death isn't news anymore. The protests, which are currently happening, obviously are news. As he's the face of the protests, he is in the news for that. Why wouldn't he be?"
1934,im0v4q,"Lmao also very Republican: calling someone else offended for saying something you said is republican. Sounds like you're the one that got offended, bud.

1939,im0v4q,"I don't care about people who get shot after pointing a gun at a cop. Or any other act that threatens the lives of the police. I'm not happy that those people are dead, but it's not murder. It's not a tragedy. The vast majority of the people killed by police are armed and do not comply with police orders.

My point with the news was that 100% of the children rescued did not deserve what happened to them. At least some (the vast majority, but even if you disagree, at least some) of the people killed by police brought it on themselves.

Black people are not being systematically murdered by police. There are some who have been murdered, but most are criminals who were killed after putting the lives of officers at risk."
1940,im0v4q,"The news reports the deaths as the systematic killing of black people. The news calls every death a race motivated crime. The narrative pushed is that none of these people have acted in a way that brought about their own death. When that is what the news says, they don't need to say directly, ""Police are killing black people indiscriminately""; the message is clear all the same.

Also, you should teach your children how to behave around police. You should teach them to comply with orders. You should teach them to not aim a gun at police. You should teach them to not resist arrest, even if they are innocent. Most people die from the police because they do not comply with orders. Those that are murdered even when complying, yeah, I'm with you for them. It's awful. But it's also a small, small minority of the deaths."
1941,im0v4q,"You are completely missing my point. He is only the face of the protests and riots because of the media. He has only ever been portrayed as an innocent man murdered by police. He has been made into a martyr. And yet, in reality, he was a criminal who died from drugs and severe medical conditions.

My point, for this issue, has always been the amount of reporting done for him. He may not still be the main topic of the day, but are you really trying to act as though his death did not receive more coverage than child victims of sex trafficking being rescued? He was a news topic at a much larger scale than the traffickers.

My point has been that the media covers things that they can spin to a narrative they want. News that doesn't contribute to their messaging gets minimal coverage and then is never touched upon again. Child sex traffickers should be a bigger news topic than a criminal on drugs dying."
1942,im0v4q,"I guess I learn something new everyday. Gosh darn, you really showed me! What was I thinking, posting on reddit!?"
1943,im0v4q,Feels like a circus.
1944,im0v4q,"The number is 9, not ""thousands."" That moron just never bothered to look up the stats."
1945,im0v4q,"Which black person died after pointing a gun at a cop? Did George Floyd? Did Brianna Taylor? Elijah Mclclain? Which one? This is the pro life party, right? You ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù about a life being taken because it‚Äôs a black life."
1946,im0v4q,"Again - you are concluding that message yourself, the media is not saying that. However, you‚Äôre not the only one that has that interpretation, there are many other people who don‚Äôt seem to understand why people are protesting. If you look at the MSM articles with no predefined conclusions you will see that they are reporting deaths of people very matter-of-fact. For example, most people realize that you probably shouldn‚Äôt be shot in the back multiple times when walking away, running away, laying on the ground, be put in chokeholds, etc. Also, it is predominantly black people who are getting killed this way. For example, I have never heard of a white person getting killed jogging even though white people are a much larger share of population in the USA. 

I agree people should teach their kids how to behave around police, however they should not be fearful of police. You personally might not be fearful of police, but that would be a reflection of your personal experience/privilege. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, but it would be helpful to realize that not everyone has had the same experience as you. 

This whole discussion is very similar to the border security situation where some people say ‚Äúhey border walls don‚Äôt work‚Äù and that narrative gets spun into ‚Äúopen borders‚Äù even though no one ever said that. People need to be willing to critically examine and realize that there are multiple solutions to problems. For example, ‚Äúdefunding the police‚Äù means allocating more money towards mental health / social experts to deal with emotional situations rather than sending police all the time. Same as when you call 911 and get the fire department when you have a fire."
1947,im0v4q,So ALL lives don‚Äôt really matter to you then?
1948,im0v4q,">He is only the face of the protests and riots because of the media.

He's the face of the protests because it was his death that started them in the first place, not because of media portrayal.

>he was a criminal

He wasn't committing any crime when arrested, and regardless, police aren't supposed to kill guilty people either.

>who died from drugs and severe medical conditions.

There is literally video evidence of a cop intentionally suffocating him until he died. We have all seen it.

>are you really trying to act as though his death did not receive more coverage than child victims of sex trafficking being rescued?

Of course his death recieved more coverage. The reason for that is the movement it caused. If those trafficking victims being rescued inspired a wave of global protests against human trafficking I'm sure there would be a lot more coverage of them too.

>News that doesn't contribute to their messaging gets minimal coverage and then is never touched upon again.

Again, literally every major news source ran a story on this. It isn't the media's fault that the average person cared more about Floyd's death than about the trafficking."

1951,im0v4q,"I've commented before on Taylor. Her death was a tragedy. I wish these protests were called the ""Breonna Taylor Protests"".

McClain was not killed by police. He was injected with a sedative by medical responders. He later died due to cardiac arrest, possibly (probably) due to this sedative. He did not deserve to die, but he did resist officers' attempts to cuff him. Again, he did not deserve to die, but had he complied, he may still be alive.

George Floyd died because he was on drugs. He also had heart disease, hypertension, and sickle cell disorder. He was on fentanyl and methamphetamine when he died. Someone on those drugs, with those conditions, combined with the stress of being arrested... well, it's no surprise that he died. He resisted arrest for over ten minutes. He was not an innocent person who was executed by police. The officer that restrained him by putting his knee on Floyd's neck did not murder him. I believe he should receive legal consequences due to using excessive force to restrain Floyd, but the officer is not responsible for his death.

And to accuse me of not caring about black lives. I won't take that bait. I care about lives when they are taken unjustly. I don't care when thugs bring about their own deaths. I would much rather read about a person being killed by police than read about a cop killed by a criminal."

1953,im0v4q,"I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve watched the body cam footage, but George Floyd was absolutely insane during that arrest. They finally got him into the car and he then demanded to get on the ground. He pretty much threw himself out of the cop car onto the ground and was being extremely erratic (probably because he was hopped up on so many drugs). Then, the coroner‚Äôs report shows that he died of an overdose complicated by existing heart problems and COVID-19.

Breonna Taylor‚Äôs boyfriend shot at the police. In response, they shot back. That‚Äôs a pretty predictable chain of events.

Elijah McClain shouldn‚Äôt have died and his death was a tragedy.

I care about all lives, which includes black lives, but you‚Äôre not going to get anywhere by fighting the big ol‚Äô boogeyman police officers. Black men kill cops more than cops kill black men. Why is that not a problem? Black men kill other black men at extraordinarily high rates. Do you want to address that? Black and Hispanic men are more likely than their white counterparts to be in gangs and, thus, be involved in gang violence. Isn‚Äôt that an issue?"
1954,im0v4q,"That you haven't heard of white people being killed by police is only proof that the media only reports the deaths that fit their narrative. More white people are killed by police than black people, but you can't name a single one. I bet you can name at least five black people killed, but no white people, Asian people, hispanic people, or any other race. And that's largely, if not entirely, because the media doesn't cover those deaths. Just as they don't cover the deaths of people at the hands of black men. They've a narrative to push, and they do very well at pushing it.

The reason I do not fear police is because I am not a criminal. And the few times I have been stopped by police (surprise, it happens to innocent, white people, too), I have complied with their demands, and given them no reason to fear for their lives. If I had instead pulled a gun on them, ran from them, or ignored their demands in any way, I would have been escalating the situation. If I had threatened their lives, I would have likely been shot. I guess my acting appropriately around police is just ""privilage"" though.

Border security is a stupid thing to compare this to because people are pushing for policies that would effectively make our borders open. People are against ICE. People are against deporting illegal immigrants. People think illegal immigrants should qualify for social services. The list goes on. If you believe that someone who has entered the country illegally (or has remained here after their visa expired) should receive the same benefits as a citizen, than you are effectively against criminalizing the act of being here illegally. And if it is not a crime to enter the country without going through a set process, than you effectively have open borders, regardless of what you call it."
1955,im0v4q,"I don't want anyone to die. However, if a criminal threatens the life of a cop, I would much rather the cop live than the criminal. I would much rather read about a guy getting shot because he pulled a gun on a cop than read about a cop getting shot by a criminal.

If a person is murdered by a cop, it's a different story. If a person tries to kill a cop but is killed first, no, I don't feel bad."
1956,im0v4q,"The cops were called on him because he commited a crime. He actively resisted arrest. How can you say he wasn't commiting a crime. He very much was.

The full video shows Floyd resisting arrests for almost thirty minutes. It ends with the officer kneeling on his neck in an attempt to subdue him. That act was excessively forceful. The cop should be punished for that. However, Floyd did not die from asphyxiation. He died from a combination of severe medical conditions and fentanyl/methamphetamine use. The stress from being arrested almost certainly exacerbated things, but it cannot be said that he would still be alive if the cop had subdued him in a different way. His autopsy shows that he had a level of drugs in him that has been fatal to other people. Combined with his health conditions, he may have died during the ride to the station.

The media decided to report his death as a murder before any investigation was done. They showed a clip that has since been given context. The initial reporting showed only Floyd being kneeled on. The full footage shows the context of him resisting arrest for almost thirty minutes, shouting, ""I can't breathe"" almost ten minutes before he ever went on the ground, as well as showing the cops being very calm with him. If he had complied with them, and had not resisted arrest, the video would only be four cops politely arresting a man.

As to your last point, sure, it's not only the media that I have issue with for that. I think it's pretty sick that people care more about made up oppression than they do about child sex trafficking. You are right in saying that it's not just the media in that. It's people as a whole that I take issue with for that.

In an ideal world, no one would be killed by police. Then again, in an ideal world, people wouldn't be criminals, and cops wouldn't be needed in the first place."
1957,im0v4q,"George Floyd died because that officer pushed his knee into his neck and cut off his oxygen. It‚Äôs been proven over and over and people like you refuse to listen because of his criminal history. Lots of people have criminal histories. Lots of white republicans have criminal histories.

1958,im0v4q,Black people who are killed are also more likely to be unarmed than white people
1959,im0v4q,And data shows that black people commit more crimes than white people. Trying to blame race as the only reason that people are killed is crazy. It is a narrative that is just not true.
1960,im0v4q,"> Black men kill cops more than cops kill black men.

Just want to point out that this is *really* incorrect.

[48 officers were feloniously killed in 2019.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2019-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-in-the-line-of-duty) 41 died on the job from accidents, better vehicle/road safety would save more police lives than halving the number of felonious deaths.

[812 people were killed by police in 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222)

Of course there are a lot of societal issues that need action and the police are probably tasked with too much, but police definitely kill more people than people kill police."
1961,im0v4q,Okay look - in your very first line you misquoted me. It‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre not actually trying to have a conversation. I‚Äôm not going to waste my time responding to your ever-shifting argument that provides no evidence for your claims.
1962,im0v4q,Did George Floyd try to kill a cop?
1963,im0v4q,">The cops were called on him because he commited a crime.

He allegedly used a fake twenty dollar bill. Should cheating somebody of twenty dollars result in death?

>However, Floyd did not die from asphyxiation. He died from a combination of severe medical conditions and fentanyl/methamphetamine use. The stress from being arrested almost certainly exacerbated things

I have diabetes. If somebody steals my insulin and I die because of that, should my death by chalked up to diabetes, or should that person be named responsible for my death?

Obviously the guy who stole my insulin is responsible for killing me, right? Even though technically speaking I died of diabetes?

This is the same kind of scenario. Floyd died because of that police officer choking him.

>it cannot be said that he would still be alive if the cop had subdued him in a different way.

You can say that about literally every person at literally any time. There are trillions of different variables in the world at any given time, and for all we know the slightest thing being different at any given time could result in somebody's death.

>as well as showing the cops being very calm with him.

If the end result of the interaction is the cop kneeling on his neck for eight minutes, he wasn't calm.

>In an ideal world, no one would be killed by police.

That ""ideal world"" consists of almost every western country except for America and France. (Which has it's own issues with police brutality that I won't get into here.) The British police killed two people last year. The Norwegians haven't killed any in a decade. Fuck, you can't even say that it's about population numbers or crime statistics, because India, a country with a population almost four times that of America and with a higher crime rate, has a lower number of police killings. American police act more similarly to Phillipine, Chinese, or Egyptian police than to Japanese, Canadian, or Czech police. (The last of which has a similar gun culture to America, negating any claim that firearms could be a major factor.)

America has about 1500 police killings each year. France has an average of 30 per year, and that's considered high. Even adjusted for population that leaves America much higher.

>Then again, in an ideal world, people wouldn't be criminals, and cops wouldn't be needed in the first place.

Which is the point of defund the police. The purpose is to reduce police funding to a sensible level, while moving that funding to areas such as housing, social services, and education, things proven to reduce crime. There is a reason that poor people commit more crime on average than rich people, and by redirecting that funding that can be dealt with, instead of leaving the police to deal with every societal problem and yet only equipping them for violence.

Defunding the police isn't about abolishing police, it's about not buying tanks and grenade launchers for them, and instead using that money to provide better education to poor children and help the impoverished afford food and housing. Frankly, if it wasn't for the unfortunate fact that the left is absolutely terrible at branding (calling it Defund the Police was a stupid naming decision) this wouldn't even be controversial."

For the average person not in a man‚Äôs job like I was this doesn‚Äôt tend to be an issue. Also the men who were mansplaining everything to me were also actually misogynistic. I had a guy not listen to me on where to drive, he got lost I knew where we were, because I was a woman. Seriously. The guy refused to have on google maps because the voice is female. 

Like I said though unless you‚Äôre in a position that is typically a man‚Äôs role this isn‚Äôt an issue. Men tend to be respectful towards women."

I did saw him dodging one question tho, it was a bad faith question like the ones asked to Trump about condemning white supremacy, so I care little about answering that kind of questions.

Now, destroying the division of power and packing the Supreme Court ? I do care for that FAR more than if Trump has condemned White Supremacy in the last seven minutes because apparently, not condemning white supremacy every day of the week means you are a Nazi."

If they say they're for it, but Joe Biden ends up losing and so they change their mind about it...well, that shows clearly that it's just a political power game.

By avoiding a clear answer, if Joe Biden loses and they decide they don't want Trump to be the one packing the court, they can more easily say they were never in favor to begin with. ""What do you mean we're suddenly changing our minds? We never supported it in the first place."""

2185,hyau77,"Then watch The Ridiculous 6.

It's something alright."
2186,hyau77,I‚Äôve seen a lot of videos of protestors handing over rioters to the police. The protestors that want to get things done don‚Äôt let that shit fly.
2187,hyau77,Yes. And that is wrong of them and they should be punished. But I don't pay taxes for them. I pay taxes for police to protect and serve. Not break the law and defend each other in doing so and threaten to not do their JOB when they're threatened with accountability.
2188,hyau77,Literally the second part of my comment I say that few do
2189,hyau77,Sounds like them being criminals is the problem.
2190,hyau77,"I don't think it's safe for the government to have easy access to a list of all firearms and who owns them. I can't think of a single benefit that would outweigh that one risk. Besides, a criminal wouldn't (and don't, by data) bother to register firearms that they intend to use for criminal purposes. There's also the fact that the vast majority of legal firearm purchases require federal background checks, forming a de facto registry."
2191,hyau77,"But if the topic is controversial is saying people are agents it I can agree with you on that because some people never grew up with or even cared about it. Also it's saying we should not talk about it or even dispute when we think to much is being taken away. That is basically agreeing that the gun owners protest is not allowed under the first amendment.


The topic for preventing an invasion comes from world War two by Isoroku Yamamoto. The quote I would love to tell you came from a supposed letter that has been lost in time. Now making it almost irrelevant, but kinda holds true. Last invasion on US soil was from 1812.


The part about getting past the military, all they would have to do is sneak past and make it so we can't send SOSs. Also, do you really thing a fighting force would waist a single missile on a single no name individual when you have to then replace that missile on that bird? I think not. Also I'm not the only gun owner I sure do hope they have enough missile for everyone. But on top of that I would not be in or at my home I would go into the woods surround my home town and do hit and run attack or find materials for IEDs to displace and mess with supply units. Gorilla warfare is better then you mite think."
2192,hyau77,It worked for the vietcong and the Afghanistans
2193,hyau77,Ping!
2194,hyau77,Yea that's funny. The whole mob is in on it even if they aren't the ones [trying to pull down the fence.](https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1286971194764214277?s=20)
2195,hyau77,a lot? really...I've seen one.
2196,hyau77,"I don‚Äôt wanna argue too much cause we agree on the fact that cops that break the law should be held accountable, but oversimplifying their situation doesn‚Äôt help at all.

Like the cops who are facing serious charges after shooting a convicted felon out on parole who drunkenly beat them after being caught drunk driving, stole one of their weapons and shot at them. Would you go to work if defending yourself from a drunken convicted felon firing at you could land you in jail or dead?"
2197,hyau77,Plenty do. Fuck there‚Äôs a whole section of the police entirely devoted to it.
2198,hyau77,"Yeah, well... until they go off the deep end, they're only people with rights. If only there was a way to flag the crazies to watch their unsafe behavior.. hey?

In all honesty, I'm one of those who cringe at the folks who aren't practicing good gun safety, post wild speculation and threats on social media. They are ruining the rights if citizens daily with their crazy. 

And if it's allowed to continue, (their ignorance and insanity) we the people are going to see 2A rights removed. 

Just like... if police can't fix themselves to be less prone to abusing their authority... they will be defended.

No one likes the bully, the crazy fool, the criminal, the accident waiting to happen. But frankly more folks got to call them on their bs."
2199,hyau77,"If you are not worth waisting a missile for why sneak to you. You think everyone one should be able to own a gun? My father was an 82nd airborne scout ranger, I have had this conversation before. He is on your side and I hold his opinion in this matter high. So I agree the gurilla warfare would work to slow an opossing military occupation of a spot of no importance. So with that I Don't understand why it's necessary. 

Saying something is controversial typically means that it's debated in public. So I'm not taking away your right to dispute I'm doing the exact opposite of that I'm arguing for your right to dispute. weather I'm pro gun or not putting down the right to protest to raise up any other platform is un american."
2200,hyau77,"Im not talking about a specific event and obviously I can't speak for everyone, so neither can you. Stop lumping all these people into one narrative that fits your perspective."
2201,hyau77,"they‚Äôre all over twitter, if you follow the right people. Protestors don‚Äôt support that looting bs. Those are opportunists taking advantage of a movement."
2202,hyau77,"Like everybody lumping cops into one narrative to fit a perspective. I think that's what the two other downvoted replies are laughing at. However, I agree."
2203,hyau77,Ohhhh the irony in that statement
2204,hyau77,Hahahaha
2205,hyau77,"BLM leadersaying ""we will burn it all down"" are opportunists? ""Burn them up like pigs in a blanket"" being chanted by BLM supporters is extremists?
I have not seen any BLM supporter calling out the rioters and looters, despite these opportunists doing this for months.
If they don't support looting do they support rioting?"
2206,hyau77,"He's not wrong at all. You can't lump them when you see a large group parking towards moving those rioters out of the protest. You don't see cops turning in others. That's exactly why you fix the core issue by preventing those that want power from getting it so easily, by increasing police salaries and adding a higher level degree requirement."
2207,hyau77,what‚Äôs ironic about it?
2208,hyau77,"maybe you‚Äôre looking in the wrong places? Maybe you follow people that like to highlight the negative parts of the movement.

I will say tho that BLM does lack leadership and structure. There‚Äôs no clear figurehead and that can be confusing and sometimes hurtful. You see so many different people leading these protests and these people all have different messages varying in severity. 

Overall, I support the idea of the movement and I do not support looters and opportunists."

2210,hyau77,"America is 60% white. That's why a third of those unarmed civilians being killed by cops being specifically black males, 6.5% of the population, is such a problem. 

And 6.5% of the population is not responsible for 50% of the crime. Even with male and female African Americans at 13%, you still gets no where near 50%. Even with a vastly higher conviction rate for blacks committing the same crime as whites. Which would account for the actual statistics according to the FBI. With whites committing  68.9% of crime and blacks at 27.2%.

Source your sources. Dont take a few numbers splashed on an online political rags headline as proof. They just want you to be outraged enough to justify thier ad revenue."

lmao this is so wrong on so many counts it's hard to know where to begin - wonderful ""source,"" by the way - but what, pray tell, would one call *non*-authoritarian fascism?"
2339,ihxj9d,"They just neglect the exalting nation part, since they hate America. But don‚Äôt worry, just give them a CHAZ and they‚Äôll start a national socialist democratic workers party soon after."
2340,ihxj9d,Do you think it means everything literally?
2341,ihxj9d,This post is the only reason I‚Äôm not in negative karma lol posting anything conservative on ANY subreddit besides r/republican will get you crazy amounts of downvotes. I call them my collection of liberal tears
2342,ihxj9d,"I was more pointing out the irony of it, but by all means tell me why."
2343,ihxj9d,"Except it's a drawing, not a real event. Meant to evoke the memory of that time you saw something similar and make it 100x worse in your mind. Also clever of the artist to make it a woman being attacked by a group of men to make it seem even more violent and scary. This is straight propaganda."
2344,ihxj9d,"Ye I don‚Äôt care if your left leaning or right leaning. I‚Äôm left leaning as well in many issues. What I care is when someone supports a terrorist organization like the majority of the left is. You can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt support the violence isis members commit but not everyone kills kids, like the way people who support BLM are saying. The organization and their leaders are the cause behind the riots. If you show any support for them I think you‚Äôre a complete idiot who is encouraging rioting and violence because that‚Äôs what it leads too. Any support shown for isis helps them get members and legitimizes them it‚Äôs the same with blm."
2345,ihxj9d,"Are you serious? If we said every American killed by police was a black dude, do you know what the likely hood of you being killed by a police is? It‚Äôs less than 0.003% chance and that‚Äôs if we said every person killed was black which is not even close to being true. The riots and protests have caused a 1000 times more damage than any police has. When you plan for change does more damage than good maybe its time to stop. It‚Äôs incredibly dumb, every person from Europe I‚Äôve met laugh at BLM it‚Äôs a joke even in Sweden the most PC country think they are fucking idiots, and Americans who support this look dumber than inbred hillbillies."
2346,ihxj9d,"BLM did that to themselves. The statement black lives matter...of course they do. Absolutely. But I do not support a self described marxist group who advocates the abolishment of prisons, law enforcement, and the nuclear family."

One of many cases. Do a search on /r/Conservative I remember seeing a few articles about the topic.

Also on social media, BLM terrorist supporters and left wingers are raising donations to bail them out of jail.

2355,ihxj9d,"I knew someone would comment on that. 

Way to nitpick.

How bout you comment on the actual content of my stance. Is communism fascism or is it not?

Or how bout I word it this way: Communism is a form of totalitarian authoritarian fascism. Is that good enough English for you?

Or how bout this: Fascism means what we say goes, or else.

Or this: Fascism means we benefit more from your business that *you* run than you do. It means if you do what we say, we give you preferential treatment, or at the very least, allow you to conduct business as usual, and if you don‚Äôt, we regulate, order and fine you into submission through the courts, through regulatory groups and through the court of public opinion. How‚Äôs that?

The US is literally a quasi-fascist state. And you‚Äôre all blind to it."
2356,ihxj9d,"Right.  Totally not a real event:

http://imgur.com/gallery/na0Suzx

And I'm not sure when the last time you saw the difference between men and women was, but there is at least one clear woman depicted in the group of attackers.

At any rate, does it come as a shock that a political cartoon is stylized?  It's intended to make a point."
2357,ihxj9d,Do your research bro. The occurrence was actually worse than the drawing
2358,ihxj9d,"No, this did happen.  Like a day or two ago."
2359,ihxj9d,"BLM are de-centralized, organizationally. There is no national ""leadership"" in the traditional sense. As such, there is no national coordination or strategy. I doubt there ever will be.

Nothing happening right now in this country is even remotely comparable to what ISIS have done. I think that comparison is as comical as the absolutism attached to it. I can absolutely reject the violence and bad actors who purport to support the BLM movement while also supporting the message itself. There is a ton of room for nuance here and true supporters of the message of BLM understand that.

Excusing the pun, it's not as black and white as you make it to be."
2360,ihxj9d,No I don't because they aren't out setting fires and attacking motorists and trying to destroy this country from within. I dont know how you can even attempt  to equate one with the other.
2361,ihxj9d,Maybe not bring guns to a protest? That goes for the left and the right?
2362,ihxj9d,"This is what I'm saying though. I side more on the democratic side but do you think that means other people and myself think rapists should be let out of jail? Fuck. No. Also it was just one instance? If so, do you think ""letting the arrested terrorists out of jail"" is a fair statement?"
2363,ihxj9d,[removed]
2364,ihxj9d,First I've seen of this event. So dumb. I wish they understood shit like this sets the BLM movement back.
2365,ihxj9d,"It was not clear from the post though what incident this cartoon refers to, so I understand u/PopeJP22‚Äôs misunderstanding of what this depicted."
2366,ihxj9d,You do understand that you can support black rights by voting for a politician or governor you like without supporting an organization that cause riots and violence. It‚Äôs so dumb by promoting blm you give them more support and it inevitably leads to more riots and protests. How can people be this naive. Meaning good and doing something good are two very separate things. Even if you support the message by promoting it you‚Äôre causing damage. It‚Äôs why violent organization have to be denounced. It is a organization it takes donations it doesn‚Äôt matter if you only support the message people will associate BLM group with the BLM movement and in turn legitimize them.
2367,ihxj9d,[removed]
2368,ihxj9d,"It's not a protesting your burning shot down, looting businesses, and assaulting random people. Quit making ""protests"" violent and there would be no need"
2369,ihxj9d,"BLM are literally domestic terrorists, they are out on the streets looting cars, throwing bricks through people‚Äôs windows, vandalizing federal buildings, and assaulting people for being white, and assaulting people if they don‚Äôt blindly follow their ideologies. /r/ActualPublicFreakouts have many videos showcasing BLM people assaulting others. I just saw a video of a BLM terrorist smacking a shop owner‚Äôs head to the pavement a few days ago, all because the shop owner was trying to stop his store from getting looted. With all the chaos they‚Äôve caused, it‚Äôs pretty safe to call them terrorists.

Many BLM leaders have also been caught for being pedophiles, planning attacks in the city. Look it up.

This is just one example. https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-leader-if-change-doesnt-happen-we-will-burn-down-this-system/

The ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a few bad apples‚Äù is not a valid argument. Just because you don‚Äôt have a 100% attendance rate does not mean BLM are not terrorists as a whole. And thank god, the entire country would be gone if these terrorists do have a 100% attendance rate in destroying the city."
2370,ihxj9d,[deleted]
2371,ihxj9d,"Politicians are part of why things are they way they are now. That's not a basket anyone who supports this movement and message should be chucking all of their eggs into. I have always been deeply skeptical and cynical of politicians and I continue to be, both democrat and republican. They are largely in it for themselves, particularly the ones in the national spotlight. If there are politicians worthy of actual support, they are likely at the local level and even then, my cynicism remains.

I can support the overall, general message while denouncing the methods behind it that do not advance the cause in the direction I believe it should be going, such as the top of this thread. I don't consider that naive, I consider that to be nuance. That's a fundamental difference that it's clear we won't agree on so I don't really see much of a reason to continue this particular discussion. I said what I wanted to say."
2372,ihxj9d,"I don‚Äôt think many people are against police reform, I know I don‚Äôt speak for the whole Republican Party but I know that I myself am not against it in any sense, I actually haven‚Äôt met a republican that is against it but you may have met someone like this I‚Äôm just saying as a republican I‚Äôm with you on this, I think police reform is mostly bipartisan"

2399,irhktt,"I do think the director was ultimately trying to be against the sexual exploitation of children with this film. Because, in the end, the message is that this type of stuff is toxic to young girls. And it's clear that the main character sort of regrets loosing her innocence, so to speak, at such a young age. But, it was very wrong to use actual 11 to 13 year old girls to make the film. The director could have, at the very least, found competent adult actors who could play the leads, while looking younger. That way, hebephiles around the world wouldn't be using it for their sexual viewing pleasure right now. It was poor judgment to actually cast young children in a film about child sexual exploitation, and then to ironically do just that: exploit them."

After all they helped my exes dad who molested his daughter to ruin my entire life, off misconceptions and violations of my diary(constitutional privacy rights violations tool). Then went ahead and tried to prevent the kid who molested me from going to jail. Because protecting these individuals like my ex and her family, would have cost them money and made them look like the monsters they are. Thought they had zero issues persecuting me over misconceptions because I‚Äôd never done such a thing. Though of course doing so to in their minds had justification, validated their reasoning to attack me/do what they did and void protect their enterprise/shield their actions.

That said, if you were to make a movie about the horrors of snuff porn.... you wouldn‚Äôt make a real snuff porn, right? So while the message could be clear to most, using actual children and actively take part in what your movie is trying to combat is stupid. In today‚Äôs age (like actually 2020) the protection and covering of children is important; what I mean is like the example of a newly filmed doctor Phil episode (I don‚Äôt watch him but I‚Äôve seen the clips circulating and read the article over the episode) of a 12 year old girl, they covered her face and any identifying features.

2518,irhktt,"It is awesome that we can come together and all agree about this. And believe us when we say that we know our typical left leaning counterparts are not at all advocates for pedophilia or pederasty. I know so many people on the left who are just as disgusted by this as we are. But this opens up a conversation about how the left's movements have worked throughout our more recent history.

I would strongly encourage you to consider how many prominent people in media and on the left in general have praised this film or run interference in it's defense as well as looking at the history of pedophile advocacy in the US, which goes back to the civil rights movement and earlier.

What many people on the left don't know about their own history is that groups pushing pedophilia have always glommed onto the left's movements. Back in the 60's a pedophile civil rights group teamed up with the gay right's group and they worked together for some time until the gay rights group realized it hurt their cause. Now, just as we cannot condemn the right when a nazi group endorses one of our politicians, we can't condemn the left for being supported by these disgusting pedophile groups like NAMBLA... which actually exists, it isn't just a South Park joke. However, the difference is that the left civil rights advocates actually worked with the pedophile groups.

Further, the left leaning media continuously tests the cultural waters about pedophilia and pederasty with films that normalize it. There was a recent film with Bill Hader that basically humanized and made it almost okay that a teacher had a relationship with a teen (The Skeleton Twins I believe it was called). This is the Hollywood mainstream, that movie was praised. The reasoning is sort of that because homosexuality is viewed as so wrong by the evil oppressive right, that gay teens and adults have no one else to explore these feelings with. That is never explicitly said, but it is the tone they create in the film.

I am very well aware, as are all conservatives I know, that the typical left leaning person such as yourself is just as disgusted by pedophilia and pederasty as we are. What it seems people such as yourself don't see is that these groups have worked in the shadows on the left. It happened in the 60's and 70's. it happened in the 80's and 90's, there was an anarchist group that pushed low budget video games that taught kids how to pleasure themselves.

In fact, one of the most prominent ""doctors"" (Alfred Kinsey) who helped spawn the sexual revolution, was a disgusting man who asked pedophiles to log what they did with kids and tell him about it for his ""Research"". His procedures were not at all scientifically sound, and yet that man is still praised by the left today. The left ignores the incredibly dishonest practices he used and praises him. In fact there was a movie Al Pacino starred in about him that white washes away all the pedophile advocacy he did through dishonest science. I think it was called Kinsey.

I highly recommend the documentary The Kinsey Syndrome. It is so terrible to watch, it is fucking revolting... not because there are any gross images of kids, but because you learn about the vile things Kinsey and his advocates pushed. It sources its claims well, and the woman they talk to a lot in it (whose name I now forget) has documented Kinsey's work for years.

It's available on YouTube... now I'll warn you, many will argue that because of the truth of all this history that you should ignore the LGBTQ movement entirely. Don't let that dissuade you from considering the truth about Kinsey and what he did. Again, it is absolutely a nightmare to watch, but I think people need to see it right now."

2525,irhktt,Facts man. Like I always considered myself the most moderate person. In fact I was the club leader of the Democrat club in 9th grade at my extremely conservative school and my views haven‚Äôt changed much since then and  probably I have moved slightly right wing. However nowadays the woke dems make me feel far right. Initially I had begun questioning myself. My parents neither taught me to hate anyone or discriminate against anyone. I then realized that it‚Äôs the left that has gone bonkers
2526,irhktt,"Because Hollywood differs from the rest of left wingers in the USA. It‚Äôs not a one size fits all.

2531,irhktt,"Sorry, disagree. What I do agree about is that there are far too many suggestive shots like that, which aren't necessary to tell the story. I don't like it. I don't condone it. But, I don't believe this French female director actually set out to make child porn. That's not a logical conclusion.

It's okay that you're livid about the film. I get it. But, in the end, the main character eschews the twerking dance stuff, in favor of going out to jump rope, and wear conservative clothing, like a normal girl. If you watch the whole arc of the movie, that was the intent of the director... to say this stuff is bad for young girls.

At the same time, I believe she made a calculated decision to include so much sexuality in the film, because she knew controversy sells."

2569,irhktt,"Oh my goodness, let me stop you right there. It would have only taken you a few minutes of research to get this right, but I will compile the information for you.

The whole ""Now a 21 year-old can rape an 11 year-old and not be listed on the sex offender registry"" Twitter-meme greatly distorts the reality of what was actually being amended ‚Äî and your re-interpretation of that statement is even more bizarre. All the vote did was, in cases regarding statutory rape that involved anal and oral sex, shift the discretion into judges hands whether to require that the offender must register as a sex offender‚Äîwhich is the system California already had in place when addressing convicted cases of statutory rape involving vaginal intercourse. Prior, it was mandatory, regardless of circumstances with oral/anal/foreign object penetration.

If you weren't upset with the system already in place for statutory rape when involving ""traditional"" sexual intercourse i.g. vaginal intercourse/PIV (so, male with female), then there's nothing to be upset about now. It was the system we *already* have in place, and we have had that system for *decades*. It simply no longer distinguishes between what type of sex was had. Instead, all convicted cases of statutory rape will be evaluated the same, and when there is a ten year gap or less, it will fall to judiciary discretion for whether or not the convicted offender must registering as a sex offender. Where as before, SB 145 leaned harder against statutory rape cases with the sexual methods most common in LGTBQ circles i.e. requiring only those convicted of statutory rape that had performed anal/oral/foreign object penetration register as a sex offender, regardless of circumstances (nearness in age being the usual factor extenuating circumstance). It's just curbing discrimination against LGTBQ offenders is all. It is still highly, highly, highly unlikely that a 21 year-old convicted of having sex with an 11 year-old would not be required to register as a sex offender. If that ever happens, then it's time to replace the judge that permitted it.

Here is a statement from Wiener that provides contextual examples:

>""A 19-year-old has a 17-year-old girlfriend and they have sex, that is statutory rape. But the law right now says that the judge does not have to put that 19-year-old boy on the sex offender registry because of the kind of sex that they were having. But if it's a 19-year-old boy having sex with a 17-year-old boyfriend, the judge must put that 19-year-old onto the sex offender registry, even if it was completely consensual, even if they were boyfriends, even if there was nothing coercive or predatory about it.‚Äù

2643,gyazus,Democrats own this and we will not forget come November
2644,gyazus,"Repost it to conservative subreddit.

I rarely have success getting something submitted there."
2645,gyazus,That's not all. The New York DA is dropping charges against the protestors. There you have it!!
2646,gyazus,Reminder: Patton Oswald (featured one the video at the end) demanded injuries to the convington kids and also killed his wife
2647,gyazus,r/politics tells me this is just collateral damage for the greater good
2648,gyazus,"Maybe we should go protest the Hollywood studios for a lack of conservative representation. I'm Jewish, have a beard, and smoke weed, I'm confident I can be this side's Seth Rogan and I live in Philly where cost of living is less so I could make movies funnier & more intelligent than his for a fraction of the price.

Tell your friends?"

2651,gyazus,Can you share a link to this?
2652,gyazus,"Absiolutely horrible behaviour!! There need to be arrests!

&#x200B;

But why are all the cases of police brutality against peaceful protesters not viral yet"
2653,gyazus,"Because it does not fall into line with their agenda, and they own the media. The mayor of Chicago, during her daily conference, is making it seem like the police are looting and burning down cars and buildings."
2654,gyazus,"If there‚Äôs anyone responsible for the uprising of far right groups that are so ‚Äúdomestically terrorizing‚Äù the US, it‚Äôs these so called ‚Äúanti-fascist‚Äù leftist pussy cults."
2655,gyazus,"Because out of context, cherry-picked quote from MLK about riots being the language of the unheard"

2660,gyazus,Why the fuck did they kick that guy in the head when he was on the ground?!!
2661,gyazus,Where is the link for the video?
2662,gyazus,I fear for my little cousin. He is 7 and his liberal mom is filling his with things a 7 year old shouldn‚Äôt care about. Yesterday he got mad at me for wearing a trump hat. He grabbed it and stomped on it. This kid is going to grow up to be one of these people unless I can show him the way

2665,gyazus,Link to the third one?
2666,gyazus,">Why isn't it viral yet.

Because an awful lot of the people saying they're going to be donating money to this '''righteous cause''' have a single characteristic, that less than 2% of the population shares, that unfies them all..."

2671,gyazus,Gotta love celebrities bailing out criminals
2672,gyazus,"I think the bad people aren‚Äôt protesters, they are there for looting. The protesters themselves I don‚Äôt think are bad, most are peaceful."
2673,gyazus,"Because those aren‚Äôt protestors, those are rioters and shitheads. Don‚Äôt confuse the two.

There are actual peaceful protesters who where being arrested and detained. Whether you agree with why people are protesting or not, if you value freedom then you would support people‚Äôs right to peaceful protest."
2674,gyazus,Any place I can get a download link so I can post this around?
2675,gyazus,"Just like how all police are bad police, not all protesters are looting and attacking innocent people"
2676,gyazus,"Black Lives matter? More like, communist movement"
2677,gyazus,What about all the attacks by police?
2678,gyazus,It amazes me to see people would destroy america and then want to say its a bad place...no shit y'all make it a bad place...if u make a place nice it would be fine but no.
2679,gyazus,Does have a list of all the celebs who matched and promoted bail funds? I would like to know which famous people are sociopaths
2680,gyazus,Do you have any evidence to support the claim that celebrity bailouts are going towards violent criminals instead of peaceful protesters or are you making assumptions in an attempt to paint people in a bad light?
2681,gyazus,Obliviously these celebrities are not donating money to bail out these criminals that are committing violent acts.  It is for bailing out the the peaceful protesters who are being entirely compliant but being rough handled and taken into custody for no reason.

2687,gyazus,"4 videos of riots verse over 500 videos of police brutality in the last few days.  Police are too busy hurting and arresting innocent people to actually stop crime!  Wonder why it‚Äôs not viral? everybody is peacefully protesting and the riots are a tiny fraction of the protests going on.  Cherry picked information doesn‚Äôt trick everybody.  Nobody supports this crime, so stop using it as an excuse to not exercise a constitutional right.


https://github.com/2020PB/police-brutality/blob/master/README.md"
2688,gyazus,This is not what the protests represent. It‚Äôs a small portion of the protest as a whole; a sad group of people taking advantage of the situation.
2689,gyazus,"Here we go again. Put biased snippets of videos together, no one bothers to acknowledge that it‚Äôs meant to play on people‚Äôs emotions. People allow their emotions to be played, divisiveness ensues and we go round and round in circles. Break the cycle. Everyone‚Äôs opinions matter as long as they come from a place of morality. Have a conversation instead of inciting blame and pointing fingers and calling each other names."
2690,gyazus,Cherry pick the bad ones and make your propaganda films. Bury your head deeper in your self-righteous sand.

2695,gyazus,This video provides excellent context
2696,gyazus,What does matched mean.
2697,gyazus,"I dont know about the other clips, but that third clip, in the full video the guy that got beat up was literally chasing people around d with a machete or something and that's why he got beat up. I don't think it belongs among the rest"

2705,gyazus,"I agree. That dude got starched on the run and then kicked in the head while out cold. Pure bullshit. Personally I don‚Äôt think anyone should get bailed out. If they can make the decision to go and destroy someone else‚Äôs property, business, or hurt someone as a form of ‚Äúprotest‚Äù then they should be held accountable just like anyone else would be in the normal world."
2706,gyazus,You should see the full video of that dude on the ground in a weird position with his head closest to the camera. He literally got stoned. I don‚Äôt know if he died or not but there was blood everywhere and it was like six people just pummeling him with rocks and kicks. I don‚Äôt find many things disturbing but that video was hard to watch.

2708,gyazus,"Not in Cuomo and DeBlasio's New York. I've always wanted to be a complete tourist and visit New York City, but that has changed.

Instead, Republicans should look into visiting San Diego. I know, I know, it's in ultra-liberal heaven of southern California, but most people don't realize San Diego has a republican mayor. Mayor Kevin Faulconer. I believe San Diego is the most populated city with a republican mayor.

It should be to nobody's surprise that San Diego is consistently voted one of the most beautiful cities in the US. Is it a coincidence that the most beautiful city in the US is helmed by a republican? Probably not.

Plus, you hear very little negative issues in the national media concerning San Diego. Also, not coincidental."
2709,gyazus,"I would personally donate $500 for that kid to spend a good 15 years in federal prison.

Ain't gonna happen tho.

Fucking a animals."
2710,gyazus,He was arrested. 14 year old kid
2711,gyazus,"Finally, video is so misleading. Us conservatives are supposed to be the reasonable ones smh"
2712,gyazus,Both of them were found and arrested. They have made bail but they still have to go to court. There is no escaping that video.
2713,gyazus,"Yeah, the guy who did that was a complete pussy. Bet he cannot even fight me in a real one on one, and I suck at fighting."
2714,gyazus,The guy from the clip in Dallas was hit in the back of the head with a skate board. The metal trucks part of it.
2715,gyazus,"If you think that‚Äôs bad, you should see what the cops are doing"
2716,gyazus,Just go to r/politics.
2717,gyazus,"Nobody is defending beating up other civilians. Literally nobody.

These are rioters/criminals.

They are different from protestors.

Very simple."
2718,gyazus,You can support peaceful protesters and hope all the asshole looters and hulligans get theirs at the same time.  Same way you can support good cops and demand change and accountability at the same time.  Stop lumping everyone into the same groups.
2719,gyazus,No one is. It's an entirely different issue
2720,gyazus,No one is defending the riots. It is a byproduct
2721,gyazus,Scroll down
2722,gyazus,"I lived in Malibu for over a decade. Let me tell you how it would go: the celebs who live there have private security or access to private security firms if they‚Äôre not already using them. I have dealt with some of these firms. These are not mall cops; they are ex-military and ex-law enforcement, armed to the teeth. So their houses would be protected by the same ex-cops they demonize while they were hiding under their beds. For those of us in Malibu who are not rich or celebs, they would leave us unprotected to die."
2723,gyazus,They understand what they are fueling.
2724,gyazus,"You're exactly right! As someone already mentioned, let ole' Seth Rogan catch a field goal kick to the head after getting his car jacked and napalms thrown at his house and see how fast he's ready to ""commit"" to bailing these garbage people outta jail? When they start to complain or say anything on their behalf, you only need remind them that it's all okay...because it's making a conversation happen and now he's gotta pay attention!?"
2725,gyazus,This is fucked man

2730,gyazus,[deleted]
2731,gyazus,"I think it was initially intended for people who were arrested for peaceful protests.  I have no idea if they are really bailing out criminals. 

There are a lot of reports of people being arrested or detained for being at protests. I have very Conservative friends who have been to a few protests to see what was going on and they personally witnessed regular people being arrested for no reason. I think police are having a very difficult time in knowing who is causing trouble. 

I think that is what the matching started with."
2732,gyazus,"Well, just in the democrat run cities. Rome suffered because they weren't interconnected like we are and died if a capital city or port cities died.

Too many differences to detail but history can't really repeat like how society was in 476AD and the 211 years it took. Also, it didn't fall, it became the Byzantine empire."
2733,gyazus,"Should we call it ""Peaceful Rioting"" hahahaha"
2734,gyazus,this is a farm account meant to stir up shit. look at the account age and comment content
2735,gyazus,"Congrats! Before you believe everything you see on the internet I urge you to research both sides. Otherwise you‚Äôll just be spoon-fed whatever you see. Here is a link to a compilation of recent police brutality (scroll down to the comment thread) 

https://reddit.com/r/ActualPublicFreakouts/comments/guevwg/_/fsi4yf2/?context=1"
2736,gyazus,True. It would probably be more effective to nail 93 ways to change policing in America to the doors of every governor‚Äôs mansion and police precinct.
2737,gyazus,Those are rioters. This is trying to further the agenda that all the protesters are destroying things when they are not. I have family in Minneapolis that has protested. They helped clean up after the looters and rioters unfortunately did their thing and continued to peacefully protest.
2738,gyazus,"No, criminals sneak into protests to cause trouble. I think the majority of protesters know. Try to go to a protest and see."
2739,gyazus,Are you comparing paying bail money for protestors... to giving money to the Taliban?
2740,gyazus,"Are they on YouTube. I kinda want to spread this around. 

I knew Seth Rogan was a complete and utter idiot but I didn‚Äôt know Steve Carrell was such a dumbass, I just thought he did a good job portraying one in The Office."
2741,gyazus,"Granted, have they reported enough that these criminals been bailed using so-called celebrity money?"
2742,gyazus,So... you‚Äôre willing to cede the point that these violent people discredit the entire movement? Just for a quick jab at police officers? Sure. Whatever. Have fun unraveling that philosophy.
2743,gyazus,"This entire movement is based on the act of one officer, who has been charged with a crime."
2744,gyazus,"Ah yes let's judge protesters by they're worst individuals, but the police brutality they're fighting against is ok because its only a few bad apples.

Fuck these assholes but goddamn why is the police allowed to restrict first ammendment rights."
2745,gyazus,[removed]
2746,gyazus,Yeah I don't think so. These clowns are pushing the white guilt trips pretty fucking hard.
2747,gyazus,[removed]
2748,gyazus,"It is certainly true that the white rioters were the primary agitators the past two weeks. I have seen many videos of black protestors trying to stop white vandals.

Black and hispanic people as a group are more conservative than the young white far left. 

Blacks still vote 90% for democrats, but on polling of policy issues like presented in AOC‚Äôs new deal they are far less left leaning. 

On Climate change, immigration and gender issues particularly, but also on many capitalism vs socialism questions"

2764,gyazus,If we all stopped watching actors and movies funded by criminals there would be no more movies to watch .. you literally have to be extreme left and demonstrate it weekly to have a career in Hollywood I think
2765,gyazus,I‚Äôm sure the money will be managed properly to the cent.
2766,gyazus,"No they don‚Äôt, also I‚Äôm sure a lot of these attacks weren‚Äôt justified but I know the guy in the green shirt was trying to attack people with a sword."
2767,gyazus,"He was defending his store.  Edit: Neighborhood, via twitter and PD. The wrong move on his part was to go straight for the crowd."
2768,gyazus,"There is no good reason to riot. Protest, yes. Riot and loot, no."
2769,gyazus,You can't possibly defend these people and not be a genuinely awful human being at this point
2770,gyazus,"Hold on, we're the ones that are lost?

Are you serious?"
2771,gyazus,"If you use violence and intimidation to fight those that you deem to be fascists (which in Antifa‚Äôs case is anyone to the right of them), then yes, by definition you are a terrorist"
2772,gyazus,"Lol, 

you got me. /s

Fuckhead"
2773,gyazus,"Everything you don't like is fascism, huh?"
2774,gyazus,No attacking people because they are white and debating them is being a terrorist
2775,gyazus,"They aren‚Äôt protesting, they are ‚Äúenjoying‚Äù the no cop situation"
2776,gyazus,Cowards. Little needle dick boys. You put that suspect in Pelican Bay for a day in any pod with the big boys. Oh it ain't pretty.
2777,gyazus,I know right How can people be so cruel.
2778,gyazus,"I'm not saying I advocate the bringing back of wild west Justice. However when people fear the punishment they're less likely to commit the crime.

I would think it would be hard to find the value in stealing a loaf of bread if you risked losing a hand by being caught."
2779,gyazus,Bail is important for citizens since it allows them to continue their life without sitting in jail for 6 months on something they haven't been convicted of yet
2780,gyazus,Bail is an extremely important constitutional right.
2781,gyazus,"The one from Dallas?

https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/article243133236.html"
2782,gyazus,You mean the guy who attacked protesters with a sword?  Is that the guy you are talking about.  The guy who was bragging about how he was going to do it beforehand?
2783,gyazus,"Dude on the ground was the aggressor actually, he had a machete trying to protect his favourite bar, he ran after someone with said machete to then be attacked by everyone.

Though its not right for someone to be attacked like that, and im sure the guy wasnt actually going to slash anyone, the tension at the time was at a tipping point, everyone is on edge and seeing a man with a machete is bound to get a huge response from a scared crowd.

Dude is still alive and actually only had minor injuries and has apologised for his actions too, however only the footage of him being beaten up keeps being mentioned. See AlCzervick's link, thats the full footage."
2784,gyazus,That kick should draw an attempted murder charge - it won't but it should.
2785,gyazus,Of course they made bail. George Soros is a billionaire.
2786,gyazus,So... if one guy does one thing you‚Äôre justifying someone else hurting someone else?
2787,gyazus,"Oh ive seen it, but ive also seen what the protesters are doing"
2788,gyazus,Agree r/politics is left-winged af.
2789,gyazus,"I was subbed to them but quickly realized how left they were. Just went back to look at their sources and it‚Äôs crap like: Vox, cnn, msnbc. Unfortunate they are not willing to try and bring in any POV that is different than theirs."
2790,gyazus,Show me.
2791,gyazus,"I actually feel like we‚Äôre all in agreement here on this one. 

There‚Äôs always radical claims coming from both sides. But on this issue, I think both sides are united. No one wants to see violence, and everyone wants to see change. 

Of course there‚Äôs always a very small percentage of people on both sides that people love to focus on. But on these particular issues, I feel like we‚Äôre all in agreement."
2792,gyazus,Many on Reddit are defending this behavior.  Most of the media is conflating protesting over top of riots and gas-lighting it all as either non-violent protesting or white-supremacists.
2793,gyazus,You must be new to the internet.
2794,gyazus,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/gyazus/_/ft9zos2

Didn't have to look very far to find someone defending the riots."
2795,gyazus,True. They‚Äôre only denying the riots exist.
2796,gyazus,"That‚Äôs sad bro, but I imagine very true"
2797,gyazus,"Not only that, but their ex-cop body guards are also armed with the same weapons that they say that we shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to own.  Ridiculous."
2798,gyazus,This is not what I had in mind. Get your head right.
2799,gyazus,Supporting the rioters is only a little bit worse than space force in my opinion. But it‚Äôs close.
2800,gyazus,And where does the money from bail go? Doesn‚Äôt it just feed the system that they are protesting?
2801,gyazus,Unfortunately Hollywood has just become a liberal cult at this point.  I honestly don‚Äôt think half of them believe their own bullshit.  But if they speak out against they are blacklisted like James Woods.  Like  Drew Brees.  I respected him for standing up what he believes in.  But after getting bullied and threatened he backtracked and now has ‚Äújoined‚Äù them.  Nobody is ever gonna bully me to stop believing what I believe in!
2802,gyazus,"Why are they bailing out all these white supremecists?

Edit: they are saying the agitators causing the most problems are white supremacists while simultaneoisly bailing people out of jail."
2803,gyazus,Are the tweets actually confirmed to be bailing out the offenders in this video? Doubt.
2804,gyazus,Not just Democrat cities. I live in a very conservative small town with protests and small amounts of violence. It is happening everywhere.
2805,gyazus,Happy cake day. And thank you for better articulating the comment I was thinking about
2806,gyazus,"Yeah, that's way better than what the hell some people are doing."
2807,gyazus,"Well I live in Denmark, there haven't been any huge news about riots and looters. America's economic system is trash, people with minimum wage will of course try to blend in and loot special items. If Denmark was like America, there would a lot of looters here too."

2809,gyazus,"Not OP, but donating money to help bail put domestic terrorists - antifa- could actually be worse for the safety and security of Americans. 

The Taliban's crime against us was harboring Al Qaeda. They didn't come over and attack us. 

Revolutionary Communists are a bigger threat to Americans than the Taliban. 

Emotionally, I can see how Taliban is worse. We have been fighting the  for years. But we also could have ended that shit years ago if we had an actual mission."
2810,gyazus,It's giving money to terrorists either way. Fair comparison.
2811,gyazus,"Yes, and they wonder why people refuse to respect their opinions"
2812,gyazus,Have they been bailed using that money? Or is the video put together so one can assume these violent people are jailed and then bailed out by that money?
2813,gyazus,"I think they were trying to say the opposite, that a small group of violent people doesn‚Äôt discredit the entire movement, just like a small group of violent cops shouldn‚Äôt reflect on all cops."

Yet they feel justified. Leftism has become religion. Do not be surprised when one of them blows up a plane or commits an outright terrorist act.
2831,gyazus,"I think the point of the video was not to say bail should be suspended. It‚Äôs that these Hollywood celebs were providing a specific fund for bailing out violent rioters. Example: A guy could be arrested for mugging someone. I believe he‚Äôs entitled to a bail hearing but I‚Äôm not going to donate to a fund for him. In this instance it‚Äôs particularly disturbing because we can see videos of what they‚Äôre doing. We would see how fast this fund would dry up if there was a video of someone soccer kicking Seth Rogan in the head in the streets of West Hollywood. He has no brains to damage anyway, but my point remains."
2832,gyazus,"When continuing on with their life means going back in the streets to rob, destroy, burn and attack innocent people, they better off staying the fuck in jail. I‚Äôm not saying we should eliminate bail. However, the court can decide to charge someone without bail in the likelihood he will offend again or will vanish and avoid trial. I think it‚Äôs very safe to assume that all these assholes after being bailed out got back to do exactly the same thing they were doing when they got arrested."
2833,gyazus,What about when there is video proof!?
2834,gyazus,"I hope you're not going to school to be a lawyer.

There IS NO Constitutional right to bail.

Ever hear the phrase, ""held without bail""?

There is a Constitutional protection against EXCESSIVE bail, but not TO bail.

It's sad that sooooo many people have a drastic and false misunderstanding of what rights are real and protected by the Constitution, and what ""rights"" are fabricated and a figment of the imagination."

I'm willing to bet the person who kicked the man in the head grew up with no father, or a father who was so passive that he never taught the kid about simple fighting rules. (Like don't kick a man while he's down)"

Same people who call 2A advocates ‚Äúnuts.‚Äù It‚Äôs all an illusion and a perfect example of ‚Äúlaws for thee but not for me.‚Äù There‚Äôs also a misperception that everyone in Malibu is either a celeb or rich. Not true. There‚Äôs even a trailer park in Malibu. Mind you it‚Äôs an expensive and really nice trailer park, but still. All the non-celebs would have to stick together because I promise you the Hollywood hypocrites would not allocate their private security to the greater Malibu community."
2852,gyazus,"Yeah, it goes into the public treasury that pays for police among other things as well"
2853,gyazus,"Keep in mind, some states have done away with bail for some offenses. Meaning that millions of dollars are being donated to a fund that will go largely untouched. The protestors aren't being arrested. Except for a few exceptions, its mostly looters and rioters. Of those, the violent ones are the only ones needing bail. So these virtue signalling celebrities are bailing out the very worst people. So what is being done with this money? I keep hearing how Antifa and BLM aren't organized. So who is getting this money? And will anyone have the balls to audit these groups after being handed money that cannot and will not be used for its intense purpose??"

To draw attention to the issues? We have other ways of doing that. Social media is huge now and most people can agree that some police abuse their power and that things need to change.

These riots/killing/looting/burning are just fostering hate. Strengthening the divide. Those people in those communities that are hurt from the riots will not be taking to the cause, they will be against it whereas without the damages, they probably would've supported it. 

Peaceful protests can work but they need to be in combination with other things (not riots). The reason the protests haven't worked yet is because of the people they consistently chose to vote in who do nothing or make things worse, they drop the issue once there's a new big issue in the news, etc."
2872,gyazus,It has nothing to do with leftism its just mob mentality. People feeling more courageous in a group thinking there will be no consequences. You see the same behavior in alt right groups
2873,gyazus,Yeah I get what you're saying about the video. My point was a reply to someone else who said that they didn't think bail should exist in general
2874,gyazus,Yeah maybe but like you said the court can decide. We can't just say none of them should receive bail
2875,gyazus,Bail can be taken away for high stake crimes where the criminal is better off fleeing the country than risking going to prison for life or getting the death penalty. It's hard to say in this case since video evidence amounts to some guys in hats and masks where they aren't easily identifiable. Really though it's best to not cross the line of bail as much as possible. Giving more power to the government should always be questioned because changing the system right now could result in future abuse

The left have been too tyrannical for too long, and Trump is fighting back by reducing some of these bullshit regulations. The left imposed a tax for rain falling on your property for fucks sake. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter what Trump does now or in the future because of the R. The media has called wolf so many times that I wouldn‚Äôt even believe them if they were telling the truth. I‚Äôve caught CNN especially in so many lies that it isn‚Äôt even funny. If you remember Bush 2, the media did the exact same thing to him. He ignored them and let them lie and drag him through the mud. Trump returns fire, and that‚Äôs one of the reasons he won. He wasn‚Äôt afraid of treating people how they treated him.

It‚Äôs so much harder to find that over at r/politics. Not because those people don‚Äôt exist there, but because they‚Äôre drowned out by all the shit being thrown everywhere. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you can find shitposts on both subs. I just wish we‚Äôd realize that these shitposts don‚Äôt help convince anyone on the other side of your view.

I am not sure how many ‚Äúrightwingers‚Äù are defending bad behavior by police.  

Like all necessary government institutions, federal, state and local they by nature seek to grow their size, their reach and their power to limit citizens freedoms.

Their power should be constantly minimized.

At the same time there were some very bad actors on the fringes of the protest destroying properties and lives. One does not cancel out the other."
2896,gyazus,"Show me a group of right wingers who are in support of what you just claimed. 

Are you aware that the left is being completely hypocritical about everything that‚Äôs happened in the last few months? Let me explain. 

A few weeks ago you were labeled as a far right evil killer for going out and **peacefully** protesting the Covid restrictions, especially those pertaining to Church. Now the left has completely ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù about the covid restrictions and are in full support of thousands of people protesting together. The right wants freedoms, the left wants to restrict them except when it benefits them or their agenda. 

Who here is denying police brutality? I‚Äôm certainly not but I‚Äôm not going to condone this behavior In the video and support it like those dumbass Rogan and Carrell pussies. There is a difference between being against bad and overstepping police and then all out anarchy and trying to kill American citizens just because you can. 

Lastly, the left needs to pick a story and stick with it. First they were against protests, now they are ok with it. First they said the protests were peaceful when they were violent, now they admit they are violent but it‚Äôs white supremacists being violent. (Why would a white supremacist care if a black person was murdered?) there must be a lot of black white supremacists by that logic. And now currently we have left wingers and actors like Rogan who are supporting these thugs, so are they supporting white supremacists? Seriously the mental gymnastics of the left never cease to amaze me."
2897,gyazus,"I haven't seen any of your other sources, but the old man in buffalo. You didn't see the whole video, the one you saw was probably cut to them just shoving him down.

If you follow the far left and the far right long enough they just end up meeting along that circle. Like Thanos said there is a balance, for safety and maximum freedom.

I‚Äôm not saying this isn‚Äôt an issue and I‚Äôm not advocating for violence against police, but the people who lean right are also most likely the same ones who don‚Äôt attend the protests and don‚Äôt get to see first-hand how protests are often peaceful until police arrive and start throwing tear gas and firing rubber bullets without cause, which then causes them to turn more into riots.

I‚Äôll say that again, these people are protesting for police accountability while the others were protesting temporary regulations to prevent tens of thousands of deaths. Who are the pussies again? 

Want to talk about hypocrisy? How many mass murders have been caused by the second amendment? But those don‚Äôt represent a majority of gun owners and therefore there should be no restrictions placed on the second amendment, right?

2930,gyazus,"People like to say peaceful protest... But as we have seen these ""peaceful"" protest have become violent because of a small few catalyst ""aka stupid people trying to create chaos (this is people blocking streets and highways) "".  So when police show up to restore order and/or protect property and citizens or people peaceful protesting... They don't know who are the peaceful ones and which ones are trying to start violence.  They are on edge... They are looking for agitators, people not listening to them to move to areas ok to protest... So when someone is confronting them in a way that is not peaceful (yelling, postering, aggressive hand movements, and then the obvious of throwing stuff, etc.)  they have a duty to stop this person from creating a situation that is dangerous for the community and letting it get out of hand.  So many times we always see the videos of the cops reacting and not what led up to their reaction.  Which the media (news outlets, social media etc.) uses to stoke the fire and create a more hostile environment/community."
2931,gyazus,Yet certain churches are still closed. Do you not see how retarded all of this is? If Floyd was never murdered protestors would still be condemned by the left.
2932,gyazus,"I never said you were a liberal or leftist, I‚Äôm simply talking about the hypocrisy we see on the left. 
First, it doesn‚Äôt matter what someone is protesting, they have the right to protest. I‚Äôm not against the protestors, hell I‚Äôve been to a protest. Is it so hard to understand that I, along with most conservatives, support the protestors but don‚Äôt support the looters or rioters? 

The vast majority of conservatives aren‚Äôt ok with government enforced curfews, or the military/ Le enforcing unconstitutional laws. Ever met a 2A supporter? We absolutely hate every bit of this and we hate most aspects of the government especially LEAs like the ATF. The left argues that only police should have ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù after any sort of shooting, and then a week later don‚Äôt want any police at all.

>How many mass murders have been caused by the second amendment? But those don‚Äôt represent a majority of gun owners and therefore there should be no restrictions placed on the second amendment, right?

No mass shooting has been ‚Äúcaused‚Äù by the 2A. Canada doesn‚Äôt have a 2A yet they just suffered from their worst mass shooting ever in their history. Even if the 2A somehow deliberately caused mass shootings many many more lives are saved by guns every year than taken by them. Being in support of a constitutional right doesn‚Äôt make you a hypocrite unless you simultaneously don‚Äôt support one of the other Amendments (such as freedom of speech) and I‚Äôve never met a conservative who was against any of the Amendments. Remember not being hypocritical would be for BLM to ACTUALLY care for ALL black lives, yet they ignore David Dorn or the hundreds of blacks killed in cities like Chicago every year. 

These people going to the protests and causing damage to private property, beating people up, and destroying monuments like the Lincoln Memorial or the 54th Regiment (which ironically was made up of  black people) aren‚Äôt protestors, they are thugs; using the death of an individual for their own gain be it to loot and steal or to just go wild. 

I‚Äôm not contradicting myself, being hypocritical, or playing mental gymnastics my point is the left *is*. You can try and act like an enlightened centrist, hell maybe you are, but then I don‚Äôt understand how you don‚Äôt see how hypocritical the left is being."

2937,gyazus,To be fair churches have no reason to open back up as they arnt (or at least shouldnt be) a business. They also arnt vital to paying taxes so them remaining closed isnt hurting anyone.
2938,gyazus,"You contradict yourself every time you refer to protesters or rioters as thugs and call the people who support them pussies. If a thug is measured by how they brutalize innocents then each cop who commits an act of brutality against a peaceful protester is also a thug and the people who support them are pussies by the same measure. Now we‚Äôre at a stalemate. 

I never said YOU felt the protests were wrong, but there‚Äôs no denying that a vast majority of right wing news outlets and the president are  guilty of branding all the protests as violent when in reality it‚Äôs a very very small proportion of the people there that act like that, and in many cases these protests only turn violent after police show up and begin tear gassing and beating protesters.  This was to show that while you call the left hypocritical for protesting for basic human rights (which may be hypocritical, sure), it‚Äôs also hypocritical to not recognize that both parties exhibit their fair share of hypocrisy. 

I will cede that the outrage for the death of David Dorne isn‚Äôt as publicized as it should be, but he was killed by looters who were taking advantage of the protests and that responsibility doesn‚Äôt fall to the peaceful protestors and the right has weaponized his death and black on black crime to deflect from the issue at hand which is nothing less than gross. Black on black crime is a complicated issue that plagues the black community, but the difference is that when a black person kills another black person on video and with several witnesses, they will without a doubt be jailed. If you know a few cases where that didn‚Äôt happen, I‚Äôd love to know. But there are countless videos and instances of police killing unarmed black people who aren‚Äôt resisting arrest and they get paid administrative leave. And to be frank, the issue of black on black crime has very obviously been caused by historic oppression of black communities, the inability to gather generational wealth, and underfunded schools. Dems and republicans share the blame for causing these situations but the people who are really to blame are the ones who look at a community who was denied human rights for over 500 years and expect them to catch up to the rest of America after only ~50 years of little/no support from the government and no federal hate crime laws to enforce their equality."
2939,gyazus,"But it takes the severity away? Tell that to the doctors or his family. ‚ÄúHey don‚Äôt worry he‚Äôs bleeding from his ear but they helped him out real quick!‚Äù 
Either they deserve to be charged or they don‚Äôt. No in between."
2940,gyazus,"Do yourself deny that there are major riots born out of these protests?

Do you deny that there have been deaths at the hands of those people?

Even on cnn, when they were calling the protests mostly peaceful you could hear firebombs going off as they were talking to their on the ground reporter. 

Stop gaslighting."
2941,gyazus,Use google and go away...  Add your name to the list while you read up on her.
2942,gyazus,"That‚Äôs stupid to be against churches having freedom of religion or assembly but being ok for protests (which also aren‚Äôt essential) to have their freedom of speech or assembly. I‚Äôm fine with both, however beating up people and destroying private businesses isn‚Äôt the same as protesting."
2943,gyazus,"I‚Äôm not referring to protestors as thugs, I‚Äôm referring to the people in the above video, rioters, looters, etc. I‚Äôm not calling people who support the protestors pussies, because I‚Äôd be calling myself a pussy then. I‚Äôm calling people like Rogan a pussy, he‚Äôs literally giving money to bail a violent person out of jail. 

I actually would say that the brutal cops are indeed thugs. Simply being a cop doesn‚Äôt keep   someone from being a thug. 

As for the rest of your reply I actually agree with most of it. Both sides of the media is being biased over this. I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard to go ‚Äòok brutal cops like the one who killed Floyd are bad. Rioters and looters and people like who killed Davis Dorn are also bad. Protestors are good, they have every right to protest.‚Äô 

The left and right are Always at odds with each other. Covid and this current event should be bringing both sides together but as we are witnessing it‚Äôs only dividing our country further. It‚Äôs hard for the American Eagle to sore when both of its wings are constantly at odds with eachother."
2944,gyazus,"No i dont mean churches should stay closed forever. I mean that churches have no reason to rush reopening but saying that protests arnt essential is subjective. For one the blm movement is strong right now so people are riding the wave to be able to make as much progress as possible. And on top of that people still do get mistreated and thats a fact so the sooner we can prevent the useless loss of lives the better, the way in which the change is made is the bigger issue. Some people wre against the protests and others arnt. While obviously i wouldnt want businesses to be burned down people have to realize that when the situation with kids getting caged in the immigration detention camp happened and all the protests were peaceful there was no media coverage so nothing really happened there. People have tried peacful protesting, the less violent the better but sometimes thats just not the option."
2945,gyazus,"I think you and I actually agree on a lot of points. We share a common enemy; rioters and looters (at least the ones who devastate small business, I couldn‚Äôt give a single shit about the targets or Gucci stores or whatever) as well as the people who exclusively watch Fox News and lick the boots of the police. This was refreshing, glad we could have this talk. cheers mate."

3006,im93ql,I'm sure they wouldn't if the person they shot had this background lmao
3007,im93ql,Sadly true. And dems would attend his funeral
3008,im93ql,NFL would put his name on their helmets. Disgusting.
3009,im93ql,Yes. They would riot because we have a whole justice system set up to decide guilt and punishment. Even if you‚Äôre guilty cops shouldn‚Äôt shoot you.

3011,im93ql,And white people haven't gotten away will killing and raping children not condoning his actions just saying lumping BLM with an automatic response to that they are pedophile lovers when many of Republican party leaders have been found in possession of child porn. Saying that the reason for the protest is the fact cops are killing people and getting away with it and I bet by the end of the month they will kill another black man/ woman for doing something a white person won't be killed for.

3017,im93ql,I wouldn‚Äôt care if he rapped the queen of England he is constitutionally guaranteed a trial by a jury of his peers.  Personally I think he should be tortured to death.

Point proven. BLM supporters out here in the comments talking about Due Process for this guy. 

Of course he deserves his day in court no matter how heinous the crime. But if that's your first reaction and not this asshole needs to rot then you'd be out on the streets and shutting down entire cities in his honor of he was shot by police.

3060,im93ql,"Than* 

And it's not that people care less for the victims, it's that people are tired of police being responsible for these executions. Forget the hyperbolic stuff you see on the news, most supporters on both sides of the aisle are able to maintain distinct channels of thinking. People can be sympathetic for the victims, and simultaneously be upset that police are ending the lives of individuals, guilty or not. No one is celebrating criminals, just condemning unjust actions of police."
3061,im93ql,"And what of those that did comply, and still got shot?"
3062,im93ql,"Debunked by who? Rayshard Brooks has been to prison, he‚Äôs on video talking about it. In fact the only conceivable reason he started fighting with the cops once they handcuffed him is because he would‚Äôve been sent back to prison for violating his parole"
3063,im93ql,"And that is a vastly different view than that presented by OP. OP is presenting the view that the police executing someone for a crime they haven‚Äôt been convicted of is okay, whereas you are advocating turning a blind eye to criminals doing criminal things to convicted people.

One view is very much against the very foundation of what law and order is, and the other is mostly just shrugging your shoulders."
3064,im93ql,Not of he's going to grab a weapon
3065,im93ql,That's understandable what's not understandable is the fact that BLM and Antifa make absolute pieces of shit the faces of their movement. It's not understandable until you realize how many of them all have a criminal record at least.
3066,im93ql,"What if the cops, being the first step in due process are threatened with their life?"
3067,im93ql,"Wrong. You can shoot people who endanger your life, in some cases property, and in some cases other lives. Apprehension is not the goal. Justice is the goal.

Arrest him peacefully, shoot him if he resists. Justice is served either way, his choice."
3068,im93ql,Depends if he resists arrest and has a weapon.
3069,im93ql,"Totally agree, until they resist arrest. And I have no idea why you're making such a comment. Only one person here is stating they should kill them now "" It‚Äôs not too late to shoot the guy, just saying"" which I take as a statement of disgust, not a statement to end all of America."
3070,im93ql,"Well, I'm not sure, but it seems like you are presuming that 'shot' means 'killed'. The comment said shot and having several close family friends that are in police force, they aren't necessarily acting as judge, jury, and executioner. It's a misconception that cops are just killing people that they think are lesser individuals. When a suspect is shot, it is almost always in self-defense (stats show higher than 96% of the time). Granted, this has been a hot ticket item, but I believe personally that no one is asking for more latitude with the police force to be judge, jury, and executioner. The comment was simply pointing out that many of the examples that BLM and antifa point to in their rallies/protests are people with a violent/sexual criminal past. Knowing that information, as a cop often would, changes how you act in a situation. I mean, the extreme hypothetical situation would be basically, if you were in an alley with Hannibal lecter and he started running toward you, while licking his lips, would you try to subdue with some sort of submission hold, or would you, knowing that this man has killed dozens, try to slow him down with a gun shot to the leg? I don't believe that all of these shootings have been justified, but I also don't believe that there is an epidemic of shootings either. It seems like it is because whenever a cop shoots anyone, whether or not it was a valid shooting, the media runs it because it gets ratings. The left likes it because it helps them further their agenda of racial equality, gun control, defunding the police, etc. The right likes to talk about it because they like to say that the left stands on graves and wants to show that they stand up for the cops."
3071,im93ql,"> Why isn‚Äôt a police being a judge jury and executioner scary to you? Where is your respect for the constitution?

Because that‚Äôs not the case. Everyone with this argument acts like LEOs are leaving their house every morning or responding to every call like, ‚Äúdamn, I hope I get to kill someone.‚Äù

The fact is that Law Enforcement is one of the most challenging jobs in the world. It is the only job in the world that allows you to do two things: take someone‚Äôs life and take someone‚Äôs freedom. The training they receive and the hurdles they have to jump through just to put on the uniform is reflective of those two unique principles of the job. Applying pedestrian logic that cops are the same as a fucking grocery clerk or any other mundane job not only makes you seem ignorant, but it hurts everyone around that has to listen to you spew that bs. 

You have a right to due process, but it is not a 100% guarantee. Ask literally any branch of public service and they‚Äôll tell you rule #1 is **insure your safety and your partner‚Äôs safety**. If you have put yourself in the position that you‚Äôre being arrested or detained and you start acting out and making yourself a threat, you have yourself just forfeited your guarantee of safety as you are now endangering the safety of everyone around you. 

Here‚Äôs a scenario for you: a firefighter shows up to a fire and someone says their family member is inside. FF goes inside and attempts to find them. After some time they get disoriented and their SCBA gives them the low oxygen warning. Would you expect that firefighter to die inside the building if they can‚Äôt find the other person in time?"

3078,im93ql,"This post and his comment are about recent events.  You may have missed the story.  A black man attacked and sexually assaulted a woman.  The woman had a restraining order on the man.  He showed up and digitally raped her and assaulted her again, she called the police.  The police show up and attempt to arrest the rapist for violating the restraining orcer.  He resists.  They try tazing him and that also fails to stop him, the rapist reaches for a knife and they shoot him, but did not kill him.  

After being shot Jacob Blake, was hospitalized.  His father a devout anti-Semite radical calling for the death of jews has been elevated to ""civil rights leader"" by the mainstream media.  Now he has people like Al Sharpton stand next to his podium at rallies.  He even got a visit from presidential candidate Joe Biden.  

Oh...and the BLM movement burned down the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin in response to the rape that ended with police shooting a rapist.  And BLM protesters demand that people say the rapists name in an effort to make him a living martyr.  

At no point is ANYONE suggesting police should be executioners.  But we do need police to stand in the gap between vulnerable citizens and really bad evil people who won't simply stop what they are doing because it's wrong/illegal/immoral/depraved.   Only force will stop such evil, and sometimes as in this case, it requires deadly force.  Fortunately, in this case the deadly force did not kill him.  But it did stop him."

Seriously, this isn't GTA it's real life, in real life police encounters situations where there are weapons involved, they are legal in america. So they need to be able to deal with it, without killing people or bringing people lifes in danger.

What police needs is more training in how to do this, often not confronting a suspect, but observing and following will deescalate the situation till it becomes manageable. 

Yes, they shouldn't let someone shoot at them, but how did they get to the point of him shooting at them? He probably didn't run up to the nearest police car and started to shoot."
3114,im93ql,"We should first look at protestors criminal records and the few who are violent before we squash a protest and not address the grievance protestors have.

But it's to be fair, it's lack of training in descalation that is causing this, not necesseraily that they are racist or the like.

Correct procedure is very important, or america will become a banana republic with draconic police excercising the power of whomever is in government at the time. I don't care who it is, police should not have that power.

However how do you justify the situations where the suspect is unarmed and or running away and is shot in the back fleeing in a non felony situation.  I can agree there are situations where the police shooting is justified.  What never happens, in my mind, is a cop admits they made and error and shot/killed someone unjustly.  How many times does this need to happen before it is a problem.  Once twice hundreds times.  And the idea that 96% of the times it‚Äôs justified sounds like the cops doing the grading.  Just so everyone is clear our police kill citizens at a per capita rate just behind Iran.  Not sure bot you but I don‚Äôt want be on any list with Iran!"

We can all acknowledge that the overwhelmingly majority of LEO can go an entire career without ever using their gun.  Let‚Äôs exclude them from the argument.

The training you mentioned is not as extensive as it should be Given that fact.  Also, aren‚Äôt LEO all around the world responsible for the exact same thing with significantly lower kill rates?  Again I mention our kill rates per capita are next to IRAN!

1. Please explain why such a free and democratic country has such a horrible record with police killings. 

2. Why is it that there is not a case where the police come out and say I was wrong I shouldn‚Äôt have shot them or escalated the situation? I was having a bad day or I misunderstood? Prove me wrong on this one it is very important.  Based on pure chance this should have happened at least once!!  

3.  Why is there a history of LEO lying about events and their colleagues backing them up?  It is so common there is a name.  Thin Blue Line.  Shouldn‚Äôt all those good police be outraged at such amoral behavior?  I equate it to priest or Boy Scouts. The non pedophiles  should have been screaming bloody murder lest they be painted with the same brush.  

4.  Shouldn‚Äôt the #1 goal be the safety of the free citizens that pay their salary?  Their actual slogan is to serve and protect!  Let you tell it that applies to themselves first. We are often upset with politicians that don‚Äôt represent us why not Police?

5. Why is it when a person signs up to be a LEO they somehow become a good person?  Is it impossible that bad people sign up to be cops?

6.  Finally for me as a black man how is it you can overlook the centuries of historic evidence where LEO has been used as a tool to control and intimidate our population?   People often say how do we reestablish good relationships in the black community?  I say when we‚Äôre they ever established?  It would have had to be some time after 1968.

3157,im93ql,"Well for starters I'd like to point out that you responded with 6 questions while failing to answer the one I presented. 

> How can you argue the reason it‚Äôs challenging is because ‚Äúthey can take someone‚Äôs life and take someone‚Äôs freedom‚Äù. That is actually my argument for the problem

Reread what I said because that wasn't it. I said that those two facts are unique to law enforcement over any other career and that the training and hurdles they go through to get hired are so rigorous because of those facts. 

**1)** Horrible record in what sense? Are you referring to the 'deaths per 10 million population' statistic that shows the US at 33.5 and Canada second at 9.8? Funny how that graph DOESN'T show that the US is nowhere near the top countries in the world in deaths per 10 million. In fact, spot #1 on that list belongs to Socialist darling Venezuela. Think the Democrats want to touch that with a 10 foot pole? 

The other issue is that that's an incomplete statistic. The United States has a significantly higher population than any of the countries on that list and thus, has a much higher number of police-public encounters per year. When taking that into account (and particularly the number of violent encounters as that directly contributes to the fatality rate) the numbers are far more in line with what they should be (a fact that that study admits itself in a small footnote near the very bottom of the page). Statistics like that are intentionally misleading to create a false narrative through intentional omission of facts that explain the data. 

**2)** Honestly, this point is laughable. For starters, any instance of officer involved shootings results in said officer being placed on administrative leave while an investigation is conducted. Is that not good enough? You need an officer to make a public statement saying ""I had a bad day"" while simultaneously pounding the table that LEOs are insufficiently trained? Where is the logic in that? By the same token, why haven't I heard about someone who got shot by law enforcement to come out and apologize with the same examples you gave? You think Jacob Blake will apologize for escalating the situation?

**3)** No, there is not a ""history"" of what you're claiming. For starters, the term Thin Blue Line as it applies to police is used to describe the thin line between law and order and social and civil anarchy. The police themselves are the Thin Blue Line separating these two ideas. There is also a Thin Red Line of Courage that applies to firefighters in case you didn't know. The Left's attempt to re-brand Thin Blue Line as controversial is something recent and is done to replace the ""blue wall of silence"" term that never caught on. 

Regardless of which term you use, it is nothing more than an allegation. There is little no no documented evidence of it and certainly nothing that would prove it's a common occurrence or systemic problem as you're implying. 

**4)** Absolutely not. Whether you're speaking of EMS, Fire or Law Enforcement, the first rule is always your safety and that of your partner. The salary they receive (regardless of where it comes from) does not have more importance than their lives. ""Protect and Serve"" applies to the community as a whole and is a mission statement to protect the community from crime and lawlessness. This notion that a police officer has no right to safety when an individual becomes hostile or violent is asinine. 

**5)** It's not impossible, but it is highly unlikely. There are several things that automatically disqualify anyone applying for law enforcement such as:

* 3 or more moving violations within 3 years
* Any prior felony conviction
* 2 or more misdemeanor convictions as an adult
* Use of a hallucinogenic drug within 7 years of application and marijuana within 1 year. 
* Having any outstanding arrest warrant(s)
* Admission of any act of domestic violence. 
* Admission of any criminal act against children

People don't ""suddenly become good people"" when they apply for law enforcement positions. Law enforcement has little interest in low integrity individuals or those with criminal pasts. And those are just the automatic disqualifications. We haven't even addressed the psychological evaluation or the intensive background check. 

**6)** You're going to need to elaborate on your point here. It would seem that you're implying that America is just as racist now as it was 400 years ago which is obviously demonstrably false. In fact, if you're going to attempt the argument that the US is more racist than it was even 50 years ago I was tell you you're flat out wrong as well."

A quick Google search will provide you with many names (there are too many to list) of those killed in this manner. It will further provide you with the simple fact that unarmed Black Americans are killed at a disproportionately higher rate than White Americans by police officers. Estimates put it at around three times more likely.

Now, what this post is doing is undermining this principal goal of the Black Lives Matter movement (again, to bring about real change, justice, from the disturbing facts presented to us). But how is the post doing this? First and foremost, the man in question is quite obviously not White. There are many examples of White people committing these same crimes, but the post instead used an image of a Black person. The response to the image then goes on to *explicitly* say ""BLM would riot"" in his honor, thereby thrusting the Black Lives Matter movement and its intended goals into the argument. Together, the image and the comment, say ""look, here is a Black person committing a horrible crime you would probably support him too!"" What you get is something completely off the mark, and dare I say, racist, in an attempt to thwart an incredibly important civil rights movement within the US today.

You see, I am under the impression that Black Lives Matter is truly an important civil rights movement. Meanwhile this post, this sub, and from what I understand now, you, do not see it that way. Why don't you? I don't really know. All the facts have been laid before us, for years, with each Black person's life that is brought to an end extra-judiciously while they posed no imminent threat to the officers detaining them or non-officers who took their lives (e.g. Ahmaud Arbery). And yet many people still only choose to see the smoke and flames, the riots, to undermine the situation and shrug off any responsibility until the next Black person is senselessly killed, at which point they will again post pictures like this and denounce the screaming demonstrators.

Hopefully, this will better explain where I am coming from."

I also absolutely understand that a cop can‚Äôt allow a person to get into a vehicle that may have weapons in it, or that can be used as a weapon itself - especially if the vehicle is occupied (potential for hostage situation) - but after seeing so many instances of police officers tasing, pepper spraying and tackling other (actually armed) suspects and bringing them in alive, it seems like in certain situations, police are way too quick to use lethal means."

Additional punishment have very little preventative effect, if any at all. But training and procedure, procedure is key to handling each situation correct, and training reinforces this.

Another absolutely valid reason, we have far more black people in America than other countries, and unfortunately there is an underlying culture of not respecting authority, disobeying police, violence, and glorifying criminality within black culture. Of course no one will ever actually address this because they'll just be called racist, but let me be clear, the fact that they are black is coincidence, it's not about race but culture.

I don't think it's right to kill anyone, but I definitely don't think it's right to expect the police to be executed for a job that pays $50k a year.

No I'm not, I'm saying that cops arrest more black people because they commit more crime.

You dont' get arrested for not committing a crime bud. They're getting arrested because they've been caught committing a crime.  We're also talking about violent crime, as in murders. Almost 100% of the time, the victims of these crimes are black. People tend to kill people in their communities. White people mostly kill white people, hispanics mostly kill other hispanics, black people mostly kill other black people, etc.  So even if they are arresting the wrong person, they're not arresting a person of the wrong race.

When the media gives you Nathan Phillips' narrative that the kids blocked their path and mocked them, it looks incriminating.

But then we got the rest of the video that the Black Israelites put online and then deleted...but not before people had grabbed it.

And now we know that Nathan Phillips is a serial rabble-rouser with a history of lying about being disrespected.

And that the Native American group had a clear path to the monument, but decided to veer to the side deliberately to march INTO the group of high schoolers... and the high schoolers didn't know what they were doing and thought that maybe they were friendly and trying to be interactive with them.

Phillips walked right up to Nick Sandman and stood there and the video SHOWS the group of high schoolers having a change in demeanor as they slowly realized that the Native Americans were not, in fact, being friendly...but were saying things like, ""Go back to Europe.  You are on stolen land."""

3320,hxs205,"In a nutshell.

These kids went to DC for a ""March for Life"".  They bought some MAGA hats in DC.  At the end, they were supposed to meet up with their charter bus at the Lincoln Memorial (IIRC).

First, some Black Hebrew Israelites harassed them.  Called one of their black classmates an n-word repeatedly...berated the group.  Finally they retreated away from that group and formed a group away from them.

Nathan Phillips was doing some native American march in DC.

Members of his group released edited misleading video accusing the kids of blocking the Native Americans who were try to march and harassing them.

Well... the media reported it as just that and the story LIT UP all of the media and the kids were still on the bus traveling home while all of this happened.

People identified them and their school.  The school took the media's word for it.   Bluechecks on twitter talked about wanting to throw them in a wood chipper.  

It was just foul.

Then the black hebrew isrealites put the ENTIRE video on twitter.  And THEN they took it down again.

But people had saved it.

It completely exonerated the kids.

Additional video FROM the kids showed Nathan Phillips' group harassing them saying, ""Go back to Europe.  You are on stolen land.""

See... they didn't BLOCK anyone.

Ol' Nathan decided to veer off and march INTO their group in order to confront them.  Only they had no idea that Ol'Nate was a serial agitator and they thought maybe the group was trying to be friendly and interact.

On the video you can see it all happen, where the kids are happy and kind of playing along with the native Americans and then you see ... things change, when the Native Americans made it clear that they were hostile.

Some of Nick's group got mad and he tried to just encourage them to deal with it calmly.

And they really did.

But the media ran with the lie.  And Covington Catholic had to be closed down for several days due to bomb threats and even the videos coming out that told the real story were ignored by many who chose instead to condemn the boys."
3321,hxs205,"Couple of years ago, this kid, from a Catholic high school in Covington, KY was recorded smirking at Phillips. The media ran with it of course, until more footage came out showing that the kid and his friends, who were waiting for their ride after the March for Life, were being harassed that whole afternoon. So they started going after various media outlets and Kathy Griffin, among others, for defamation. I think that about sums it up."
3322,hxs205,Usually when a case is settled the amount usually isnt made known publicly afaik. Not a lawyer but that is what I heard.
3323,hxs205,"I highly doubt that would happen. CNN and a whole slew of other people needed to pay. This atmosphere of accuse, accuse and labeled only to find out no concrete evidence."
3324,hxs205,"CNN said the student walked towards Nathan Phillips to laugh at him and harass him, but what actually happened was the student stood there and Phillips walked up to him banging the drum while the kid just stayed and smirked a little because it was probably awkward af lol. The students were all there waiting to leave back to their college after a pro life rally"

3330,hxs205,"It‚Äôs the face of punctuated privilege. A kid who is used the privilege of being supported by adults is suddenly being confronted by one. He‚Äôs pretending that he knows how to react. I absolutely agree his expression reads as punchable, especially without context. Or, as it was originally intended by the media, with the wrong context."
3331,hxs205,"Remember how the media tried to make these kids out to be some sort of racist, Trump worshipping cultists? Yeah, that's considered ""news"" today. The msm is nothing but the mouthpiece for the leftist dems. The republicans are shit, but the leftist dems are mountains of shit."
3332,hxs205,"Case in point of how the leftist media manipulates people.  Insidious, dangerous, and worthy of being called 'enemy of the people'.  

Ironic how leftists at big tech companies censor ""dangerous"" alternative news sources, yet embrace CNN as a bastion of truth."
3333,hxs205,"The truth is always more complicated than reported, but simple demonization of one side or the other gets the ratings. And the ratings pay the bills. Does anyone have an update on this kid? The way he was portrayed in the media, I wouldn't be surprised if he's had some challenges moving forward with his life. I wouldn't be surprised if he received death threats even. This kind of demonization of one side of the other has to stop. It ruins lives, deepens the divide in our country, and only serves to benefit those who profit from it. I remember a simpler time, when people of opposing viewpoints could have discussion, respect the other for what they were - a human being - and even if they could not agree philosophically or ideologically, they could agree that they were countrymen and women who simply wanted the best for the families and their fellow Americans. But I digress. Sorry for the rant, if anyone has an update, I'd be interested in reading it."

3386,hxs205,"I am a traditional Catholic (Latin Mass, Divine Office, etc.). Whenever the Pope says something, the media take one line and put it all over the place completely out of context. If anyone would bother to read the whole statement there is nothing that is theologically controversial. Catholicism suffers from fake news just as much as the Republican party, which unfortunately turns people against the Pope for reasons that have no basis in fact.

And then, when the Pope says something actually *fully* conservative with no lines that can be taken out of context, the media don't cover it whatsoever.

As an example: Pope Francis is on record calling transgenderism ""madness"" and that it ""cannot be taught in schools."" Media didn't cover it because there is nothing they could twist."

I am not wrong, my original comment said it has since been revealed that it was over $250 million. A ten percent error could bring it up to $275 million., which is consistent with my original statement. Your inability to grasp my comment does not make me wrong."

3393,hxs205,"No they meant in the video that they think he received 10% of the maximum amount from settling the lawsuit, which is in the $25-27.5 million range. You‚Äôre not getting it. We don‚Äôt actually know how much he received, but it‚Äôs highly unlikely to have been the maximum amount."

3454,iigxvu,"Dear Republicans,
Would it be wrong of me? To ask for foreign help, as in more from the NATO's Nations, to safe us from our own self destructive president. @realDonaldTrump.
 A president with nuclear weapons security clearance. Which a president in theory of a hypothetical situation of course. Where a president like a @realDonaldTrump who's oblivious self-destructive personality. Who would rather destroy of which he may not have."

3459,iigxvu,"So the leaders of our nation are supposed to be compared with a fraction of protestors who are actually just committing criminal acts? Why shouldn't we hold them to a higher standard?

3465,iigxvu,"Ive seen some people, usually ones in less populated areas complain but my right leaning friends in more populated areas just deal with it because they know the risk of transmission is high in higher populated areas, either way I would have to wear one because I have a family member with a medical condition"
3466,iigxvu,"I live in Birmingham Alabama, and I can assure you that it has become completely politicized and everyone who is considers themselves conservative despises wearing masks, purely because they seem it a leftist agenda.  I know far more people who are anti mask than pro mask."
3467,iigxvu,"South Carolinian here, I know TONS of conservatives and libertarian types and even people who don‚Äôt think that masks are helpful and whatnot are wearing them in public when required. I saw a lady at Walmart the other day get called out for not wearing a mask and called shameful. Very few people are against masks around here to the point of not wearing them or shouting others down"
3468,iigxvu,"Friendly left-leaner residing and working in Rural (Trump country), Ohio.

I also run 1 of 3 businesses in town that a customer can walk into. 

People wore a mask and were legitimately concerned for themselves and other for about a week. 

Since then I've heard nothing but ""why are you wearing a mask, it doesn't do anything but bad!"", have gotten cussed out for it multiple times, and when Ohio mandated masks (i work in a federal building so masks were already required to be worn by employees) more people came into my office to make a point that they didn't support and weren't wearing masks. 

Many people actually have started to buy smaller stock of items from me specifically so they can come in every day and bitch at me for wearing a mask and keeping the place clean.

Its not just news clips, there are whole areas filled with anti-maskers. Most I've heard from in my area also like to point out they don't believe in masks because of Trump."
3469,iigxvu,"The hardcore anti mask people are usually on the right. But I really think the anti mask thing is a very small percentage making a lot of noise. 

  Honestly?  Like a lot of issues, left or right, the truth is somewhere in the middle."
3470,iigxvu,"I always wear the mask in public for everyone else. I don't really care much about it for myself. I live in CT a very Blue state and I have to say starting maybe 3-4 weeks ago almost no one wears a mask anymore unless you are inside a public establishment (mostly grocery stores and malls).

Today I went by a skate park in my town and there was about 40 kids and just as many parents all there without a single mask on and much closer than 6ft.

I think make broad generalizations about either side and their mask usage based on their political beliefs is ignorant at best."
3471,iigxvu,I hate it I think it‚Äôs stupid but I still wear it lol
3472,iigxvu,[deleted]
3473,iigxvu,"Totally real. The half of the county I live in practices basically 100% mask compliance. I only wear a mask indoors and where I can't socially distance and even that earns me the occasional lecture. 

The other half of my county is extremely resistant to mask mandates and most of the county Republican party is pointedly anti-mask and intentionally held rallies where they opposed social distancing. I know a dozen people that are currently faking health conditions to attempt to get out of wearing a mask."
3474,iigxvu,Definitely not. It‚Äôs the picture they try to paint though. Every republican I know understands and abides by it.
3475,iigxvu,"I think it's that a certain section of the right (which I myself am a part of) complain about the mask *edicts* as being a gross overreach of governmental power. I had no problem when it was a recommendation or a request, but when it became an order I have issues.

Full disclosure, I can't wear one because of medical issues- but that doesn't actually inform my opinion on the edict."
3476,iigxvu,"not true.

 It's just some of us that feel that way about masks and got out acting like complete idiots and get caught on video - rightfully so I'll say"
3477,iigxvu,"It‚Äôs not really true. What they dislike is the state infringement on physical autonomy. Making it an order and fining people for not wearing a mask is seen as unconstitutional. Wearing the mask outside of the political issue is not really a big deal. A small number of people don‚Äôt believe it actually helps, but most people see it as a sensible step to mitigating the spread of a virus."
3478,iigxvu,"In my county the mask mandate was passed by an unelected health advisory board. I wear one myself, but I understand people opposing things that aren‚Äôt even actual laws."
3479,iigxvu,"2-3 months of masks from a 14day to slow the spread. 
Deaths from covid are statistically in elderly. 
Mask are pointless unless you clean them EVERY TIME you go out. (You dont, you crumble it up in a drawer) And that ‚Äúcool‚Äù looking bandana is useless. 
The death stats are inflated. The cases are inflated with false positives. 
I stopped wearing. Only one place said something and i left. No harm no foul. 

Its wayyyyyyyy overblown panic intentionally fueled. 

Its horseshit. 

And lastly, im not responsible for anyones health but mine. I eat right and exercise daily. You don‚Äôt want me responsible fir your health. A dirty cloth is all bullshit virtue signaling."

3481,iigxvu,I‚Äôm a Republican and I don‚Äôt like wearing a mask. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a political issue I think it‚Äôs personal preference
3482,iigxvu,"A small handful of people started to believe that masks are useless because media in the beginning of the year literally told people that they were.(I fell for it too until I did some research). These people nowadays are scarce, but def still exist."
3483,iigxvu,I wonder as well. Like other posters they make it out.  All right side people hate masks. I live in a red area and most people are wearing masks including me.
3484,iigxvu,"It's allegedly all about personal freedom. However, this personal freedom doesn't include social responsibility. And telling people how to live their lives isn't socialism in their minds, which is what they are constantly doing, but yet the government can't tell them to wear masks. 

Republicans are far more socialist than they will ever admit."
3485,iigxvu,Very true in my area of PA.
3486,iigxvu,"Let's be honest. At the moment, it doesn't matter. They'll do what they do, what he does doesn't matter. What America does next will really decide if they go harder, if Trump get re-elected, chances are they'll bring out guns to these ""protests"" and suddenly shooting cops on sight will be defended by the left because BLM members feared for their lives... 

Honestly, Biden is complete trash, and at this rate I kinda just wanna see what happens if America has the balls to look at the media and the rioters and say ""Guess what shit birds, you don't get to influence anything, the silent majority will simply defend capitalism and democracy the way it has."" America is so disinterested in this far left agenda that is continuously being pushed, and the left creeps farther left, alienating more undecided voters and centrists. Issue I see with Trump is that he talks to much, issue with Biden is that everything he says is either a lie or completely incoherent. Hell, even his VP pick could tell you how incapable he is, and the only reasons she was picked is A: She's black, B: She's a woman, C: Everyone hates her even more than they hate Biden so any effort to remove Biden leaves the country with Harris..."

3490,iigxvu,I agree with a lot of Ben‚Äôs positions but not all of them BUT that‚Äôs the difference between me and liberals. I can and do still like Ben even though I don‚Äôt always agree with his positions. I don‚Äôt want to cancel him because we don‚Äôt think exactly the same.

3493,iigxvu,"His the broader point stands. This is a tweet; obviously it's written for brevity. If you want to have a broader conversation about the double standards of social distancing, stay at home orders, mass protests, the Lewis funeral, and the riots I don't think you'll like the conclusion.
Any conversation about a spike of covid cases must include reference to mass protests. Full stop."
3494,iigxvu,Thank you. An intelligent comment in a sea of garbage.
3495,iigxvu,Best comment I‚Äôve seen here. Very well put.

3499,iigxvu,"But I thought the experts said we were supposed to social distance, remain home when possible, and only leave for essentials and work? 
You telling me gyms and movie theaters will kill you but protesting by the thousands is safe?"
3500,iigxvu,"Most of us can, but for some reason the republican MSM can‚Äôt seem to, or assumes their viewership is so unintelligent that they can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a shame."
3501,iigxvu,Right? His ‚Äúpoint‚Äù makes his side look weak and incorrect no matteR how you look at it. Guess he didn‚Äôt think it through.
3502,iigxvu,"The protests I have witnessed, the large majority wear masks, of course in any group you have the looks who think they don‚Äôt have to. Exact same thing with the pro-police protests, most wear masks and a few don‚Äôt"

3521,iigxvu,"Most conservatives are against masks but most of these conservatives who are against masks are respectful about it and will wear a mask in public because its required. Its not a matter of if we believe in masks or not, its just a matter of use following businesses guidelines and if masks are one of them then we follow the guidelines"
3522,iigxvu,So.. I already had the Covid and cannot get it or give it.. I do not need to wear a mask for my sake or others
3523,iigxvu,No no no.  There is no truth in the middle about wearing masks.  The whole point is it's apolitical and simple minds view it through a political lens.  You should wear a mask around others.  It's just that simple.
3524,iigxvu,">I will never stand for the government forcing me to do anything.

Drive on the right side of the road? There's plenty the government forces people to do"
3525,iigxvu,"I don‚Äôt necessarily buy into this thought pattern for everything, but during a pandemic it makes sense:

  Don‚Äôt think of it as the government forcing YOU to wear one, you‚Äôre already ok with that. Think of it as the government forcing idiots to comply with medical advice without making it a law. 

I don‚Äôt like masks, but I wear it because I like groceries. Bottom line is, people smarter than me say they help. If they do? Great. What I do know is people believe they do, so if I want them to be comfortable with me, I wear it."
3526,iigxvu,"Unfortunately they ""force"" people because alot of them won't do it even if it may benefit everyone overall. 

Think of it like the ""common sense"" warning labels on hot drinks. Its not there for the 90% of people that know its hot; its there to tell the other 10% to not burn themselves with it."
3527,iigxvu,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm perfectly fine to drive at a safe speed. It‚Äôs the smart and logical thing to do. It‚Äôs when the government steps in and tells me that I have to drive the speed limit is where I have a problem.‚Äù

This is how dumb this sounds to sane people."
3528,iigxvu,"Isn't the Right all about law and order?  What part of law and order is ""I won't do anything the government tells me to do""?

Also no one should be listening to Ben Shapiro on why you should wear a mask.  That's what doctors are for."
3529,iigxvu,You can't tell what party someone is in by looking.

3532,iigxvu,"He‚Äôs just a bit authoritarian for me, and his stats are wrong sometimes"
3533,iigxvu,He doesn't let you forget his wife is a doctor.
3534,iigxvu,I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs well spoken. He just talks fast and uses fancy words to explain generally simple concepts.
3535,iigxvu,Klavan is my favorite personally
3536,iigxvu,"They're also two completely different and complex issues. It assumes that supporting mask wearing also means you support rioting. It also assumes that if you support protests over policing(misguided or not) that you also support rioting. I know folks like to pretend it's the same thing but it's not.

A equally crappy left wing example of his post:

Sorry if you're upset at our pollution control measures, if we had a school shooting would that help?"
3537,iigxvu,"Yeah, why should the White House be held to a more socially conscious standard than rioters."
3538,iigxvu,"But his ‚Äúpoint‚Äù doesn‚Äôt compare apples to apples at all. It‚Äôs fine to discuss mass protests. But they aren‚Äôt even being discussed on the same level. The comparison he‚Äôs trying to make is falling super flat.

Actually, as I‚Äôm typing this up, I realize they are more apples to apples than I thought. 

they both discuss the detrimental actions of misguided individuals. One trying to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù racial injustice. One trying to ‚Äúpretend‚Äù a pandemic isn‚Äôt happening by ignoring scientific advice. 

Somehow I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the point Mr Shapiro is trying to make."
3539,iigxvu,"Who cares about points? Points don‚Äôt matter. Points won‚Äôt change minds. He wants to profit off the hatred of the right and left, nothing more. I choose to make people think critically in order to create a better country.

Our slogan is to ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù

Not ‚ÄúProfit off the divide of left and right‚Äù

Ben Shapiro loves riots because he can make ‚ÄúPoints‚Äù like this. He wants a bigger divide and the country itself will suffer.

Would you really change your mind if a Marxist leftist made a point off something like this?"
3540,iigxvu,"Oh most certainly. I thought that was obvious. Even though I can understand where they are coming from emotionally, destroying people's property and hurting people that have done nothing to you is never justified. I do not support such actions in the slightest and think anyone who does such should be arrested. I support the peaceful protestors."
3541,iigxvu,Wet ass P word. Lol
3542,iigxvu,"Here I was thinking he was being funny, but everyone thought it was too prudish, but everyone also sort of see it as a type of moral decline."
3543,iigxvu,We can agree to disagree.
3544,iigxvu,Because ‚Äúdebating‚Äù is dead.  I bet he‚Äôs been in lots of debates and realized they‚Äôre a complete waste of time.  No one on either side is changing their mind on the big issues.
3545,iigxvu,"How exactly do you debate a left that labels you a racist cis gendered white male who is therefore outside the Overton window?

You don't. Twitter is not a debate. Reddit is not a debate. Feel free to debate. Don't expect other people to bend to your contorted idea of when and where is the appropriate time for debate."
3546,iigxvu,"Have you seen the protests. 90% + are wearing masks. 

Look at the rally today in DC. Majority are wearing masks. 
Don't ridicule the protests. The majority are law-abiding."
3547,iigxvu,I guess the experts didn't account for all of the social unrest. Funny how everyone thinks the world has to stop for the left because they believe in the corona virus but on the right everything can go as planned since they think it's a hoax.
3548,iigxvu,Thanks yea that‚Äôs what I thought but I think Ben implied they weren‚Äôt.
3549,iigxvu,Thats what happens when you want to burn and steal shit and don't want to get caught
3550,iigxvu,">if I cant I dont get affordable healthcare for my wife and 2 year old son soon, I'm going to start burning some shit down also

**insert ""I'm going to jail!"" gif here**"
3551,iigxvu,"I disagree with this as many organized protests heavily stress mask safety to not needlessly infect those whose bodies can‚Äôt fight off the virus. As to avoid being identified, officers do the same thing while also hiding badge numbers which is illegal I might add. I don‚Äôt remember the police becoming a masked force like in Watchmen."
3552,iigxvu,Why do we have downvotes‚ùÑÔ∏è
3553,iigxvu,Lol.  I don't know if Mussolini ever made a mask mandate but he definitely had a secret police force that arrested anti-fascists.
3554,iigxvu,"I live in a very liberal part of Chicago and tons of non mask wearers on the streets.  I‚Äôm a Conservative and wear religiously.  

This is a dumb generalization."
3555,iigxvu,"They‚Äôre sitting outside... I‚Äôm talking about around town, walking into the grocery store there aren‚Äôt these people POd about having to wear masks. I‚Äôm sure it does happen I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs this wide spread thing"
3556,iigxvu,"At the White House ‚Äî I mean, do you think, mayyyybe for a second there was a pretty rigorous screening process to get onto the WH grounds? You can‚Äôt even bring nail clippers or scissors onto the grounds. Don‚Äôt you think, perhaps, that they‚Äôre may have been some safety precautions in place that you didn‚Äôt happen to see? 

Were you even there? Why do you care? You‚Äôre fear mongering like COVID is the kiss of death....99% recovery rate. Stop already FFS"
3557,iigxvu,I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised by this sub cause of comments like yours. I hope you dont mind me sticking around. I consider other perspectives valuable but I just cant get myself to listen to people talking in the edgy Trump subs..
3558,iigxvu,Same in Montgomery
3559,iigxvu,"Exactly. And I hate the government mandates, us much rather it be a personal choice to go out and let businesses decide if they will require masks"
3560,iigxvu,Pretty much. I think the notion that you need to wear a mask when you‚Äôre not even anywhere near someone‚Äôs breathing space is nothing but fear mongering and junk science. However I swallow my pride and wear one in certain public situations where a privately owned company or place of business mandates it. I just look at it like putting on a yarmulke while visiting a Jewish synagogue‚ÄîI don‚Äôt share their religious beliefs but I‚Äôll be respectful of theirs while I‚Äôm in their house of worship. Lol.
3561,iigxvu,"I would tend to agree with you. Apparently there have been a few cases of reinfection, but it seems like they‚Äôre incredibly rare and probably due to an issue with the immune system where it doesn‚Äôt properly respond"

3569,iigxvu,"I agree. I am neither Democrat nor Republican, but the media has caused society to forget that, despite varying ideologies, both Democrats and Republicans are still AMERICANS. Ben Shapiro is the media. If both parties don‚Äôt hate each other, he is out of a job, because he could no longer post ‚Äúzingers‚Äù like this one. 

Social media bows down to these so-called political pundits despite the fact that the business model is literally to make as many disparaging, controversial comments about the other party for views, likes, shares, etc., which means profit for them. They are literally dividing America for personal monetary gain. I don‚Äôt see how anyone could call themselves a Pro-American Republican and support these leeches."

Why doesn't he go on as many structured debates as he does open forums? Because he's looking for people to say he's right. He's looking for a hivemind, not someone to debate."
3573,iigxvu,"I get your frustration.

A primary problem with the echo chambers (that we are all increasingly exposed to) is the prevalence of outrage porn; that is, the algorithmically-fed content that will deliver the greatest gratification & engagement in the least time is that which makes the other side look completely ridiculous, and therefore, your own side obviously correct and virtuous.

It's not a strawman argument, it's laughing at the village Twitter idiot, and pretending they're the consensus logical champion of your opponent.

NOW, I agree that it's entirely concerning how much of the country has their Overton window pointed oriented somewhat like those village Twitter idiots. But, that's largely a product of their own intellectual echo chambers and safe spaces.

I'm not entirely sure how to reverse course, but I know it involves a focus on the truth."
3574,iigxvu,"Since when were masks 100 percent effective? 1 death is too many. Stay home. At least that‚Äôs what the democrats say the experts tell us. Then they all go out by the thousands in small area and think they are invincible with a mask on. Give me a break. 
If we‚Äôre going to allow this, can I go back to the movie theater again? Pleaseeee. Can I go to a gym without getting arrested pleaseeee. 
You have to admit, the hypocrisy is insane."
3575,iigxvu,"Please list for me a single protest that did not contain any rioters. 

Look at Portland, Seattle, Santa Monica, DTLA, and DC riots, looting, vandalism, everywhere. 

Remember OJ was peaceful for 99% of his day, right before he murdered two people. ""OJ, majority law-abiding"""
3576,iigxvu,"I really don‚Äôt get the point you are trying to make. The right wants to open up more, the left wants to close back down. How can you say going to the gym will cause an outbreak but a protest by the thousands will harm no one. 
You know what we can‚Äôt calculate, how many people have DIED from coronavirus due to spreading from protesting. I‚Äôm guessing the number is higher than 1. But we don‚Äôt care about those people anymore because of social unrest? I thought every life matters? All I‚Äôm saying, is there is an insane amount of hypocrisy from the left, but the right (right of wrong) has at least been consistent. If the left was truly mindful of the dangers of coronavirus, like they say they are, they wouldn‚Äôt be advocating for people meeting up by the thousands, for ANY reason. It gives the right ammo saying ‚Äúsee, the left doesn‚Äôt care about limited the spread, it WAS political in nature to keep the economy as bad as possible because that‚Äôs the only way Trump could win a reelection.‚Äù  Don‚Äôt like the right saying that, then BE CONSISTENT."
3577,iigxvu,"I‚Äôm sure it also depends on the region, when many of the protests began in May, the northeast and northwest were hot spots. Many people there wore masks for both sides while in the southern half, many didn‚Äôt see the need yet as there weren‚Äôt many cases. Now of course it‚Äôs almost the opposite but everyone is taking masks seriously except for the aforementioned kooks"

Ben has also said many times that he doesn't really like debating.

He's said many times that he talks with people on the left and most reject his offer to go on his show.

Welcome to the real world where adults discuss multiple problems and try to find solutions to more than one single thing at a time. 

People are dying from a virus and wearing a mask helps stop the spread of droplets. It‚Äôs the same reason any well raised child has been taught to cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze. I don‚Äôt know when this became a foreign concept. 

People need to take responsibility for their part in this society and wear a mask to prevent people from **dying** and to help **re-open the economy** and to allow people to work and support their families without needing unreliable aid from the government. But apparently in this coronavirus age, we just blame others for our problems and say it‚Äôs fake and hope it‚Äôll magically go away rather than putting a iota of effort into saving this country."
3630,iigxvu,"What's unbelievable is 180,000 people dead."
3631,iigxvu,"Why would we need to ""move past masks"" while an epidemic is still raging in this country? How is not wearing a mask going to *help* any of the problems you listed?

Most of the rest of the world is already beyond the worst of this thing because they actually *enforced* their anti-COVID rules.

EDIT: This guy downvoted and then PMed me"
3632,iigxvu,I love how there‚Äôs no mention here about the people getting murdered by police or the fact that the president has done literally nothing to stop the spread of a deadly virus.
3633,iigxvu,"They are also not testing like america is, they are also counting every death as covid death, even if they died from a  car wreck with covid in their system."
3634,iigxvu,"Idk who taught you how to look at statistics but let‚Äôs break this down a bit more. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs 830k deaths worldwide, and there‚Äôs 170k in the US. I‚Äôm also going to assume the percentage you presented was asserting that America accompanies 20% of all corona cases. Which may be totally accurate however if america has a much higher population than whatever country you‚Äôre comparing it to, then America would naturally have more cases this would also be true if your country is doing a lot of testing and America has done the most tests out of any country in the world. What I‚Äôm more interested in is the rate per capita at which people are dying from the disease and that number isn‚Äôt so clear given that as long as a person has corona, it doesn‚Äôt matter how they die, it‚Äôll just be reported as a COVID death and hospital around the country were doing this because hospitals are being subsidized depending on how many COVID patients they have so more covid patients = more funding and if you‚Äôve got more cases, you‚Äôll have more deaths. The numbers are being intentionally exaggerated here in America and we can measure about how many cases are incorrectly reported and it‚Äôs been found that about 25% of deaths aren‚Äôt actually corona deaths. Knowing this we can safely assume the number is actually somewhere around 130,000-140,000 deaths. if we know the total population of America is about 330,000,000 people then you find out the actual death rate is around .04% does that still sound like a lot to you? Knowing that 99% of people who get it won‚Äôt die and only .04% will die is that really such a scary number?"
3635,iigxvu,"Thank you for doing your part so we can get back to normal faster.

You're confused? Ah perhaps I might enlighten you. Ben has repeatedly spoken on the ills of pornography in the past year alone let alone his career in punditry. 

He cries because it riles up his audience. OR as you said so well he is not ""ignoring a troubling societal issue""

I dont want to have a conversation. Well, not with an individual intent on putting someone down for 'not doing better' whilst simultaneously brushing aside a clearly sexually graphic song. 

Do try and not be so high and mighty next time. It tends to make you look foolish."
3639,iigxvu,"That time when you go onto an alt account to continue a conversation you ""werent interested in"".

3640,iigxvu,"But if you contract it and walk around unknowingly because you are asymptomatic and it spreads to me, because you didn't follow any guidelines(like mask wearing and social distancing) THEN it effects Me.

3646,iigxvu,"Snarky, not sparky. High and mighty? You tried to one-line me, to ridicule my opinion? Don't twist your doings onto me, at least have some integrity.

Foh with your hypocritical bullshit"
3648,iigxvu,"An alt account!! Lmao

Bruh just sit down"
3649,iigxvu,"I used the numbers you used, you quoted the death numbers, not me. and the only way the death toll would stop completely is if we eradicated the disease. And actually as of July 17-18 the cases have been steadily declining. And if you want to talk about the total infection rate as of the whole time the virus has been around, that number sits around 1.7 percent as if you adjust for the 25% being miscounted that number drops to 1.3% . So you‚Äôve got a .04 death rate and a 1.3% infection rate. The infection rate for the seasonal flu is about 10% while the death rate is .01%  but the thing about the flu is that we have flu shots that drop the death rate significantly, once we have a vaccine or something of the sort, the death rate will drop even further for COVID. You have a much higher chance of dying at the wheel of your car. Just wear a mask and you‚Äôll be fine."
3650,iigxvu,"Yes high and mighty 'what about porn ben'. Aka good but not good enough. Definitionally high and mighty.

>You tried to one-line me, to ridicule my opinion?

Is this a question or a statement?

>Don't twist your doings onto me, at least have some integrity

A one liner comment is neither high nor mighty, therefore you are making a baseless accusation without evidence 

>Clearly you're not interested in a conversation

Yet here I am, and there you go.

3766,j2clx9,Oh Biden absolutely did say it.
3767,j2clx9,Absolutely
3768,j2clx9,"If Trump didn't interrupt and use the approach he did, he would have lost and been destroyed. Then people would say oh he was too soft, needed to be tougher. How do you think Trump won the nomination 4 years ago? By playing nice with Jeb, Ted, Rand, and everyone else? How do you think he was able to beat Hillary? By worrying about people's feelings? No he went full out savage. And we all loved him for it. Now it's somehow an issue?

Chris Wallace was an absolute disgrace and largely the reason why the debate was that way. The topics were cherry picked. Biden was allowed to interrupt Trump at anytime by solely saying ""it's not true"" or ""that's false"" over and and over. Not a single remark from Wallace. He kept knocking Trump for it. He also wouldn't allow Biden to answer about the 3.5 million Hunter got. I'd love to know what he did for that paycheck. Why in such a rush to change topics? Don't we as the American people have a right to know?

Joe Biden didn't actually give an answer to any of the questions. Just some fancy quotes he's practiced all month and ""Orange man bad"" / me and Obama good. Biden laughed like a loser every 30 secs because everything Trump was saying was spot on. Biden called the President a clown twice and then proceeded to say hey why don't you just shut up man. Is that how you address a sitting President? ""Antifa is a thought, it's not real"". Are you kidding me? Also, why couldn't Joey B not even name one police union that has endorsed him? 

It's called a debate for a reason. As a moderator, you have to know how to allow for that to happen while also questioning the responses and maintaining fairness. He constantly questioned everything Trump said, absolutely not even once did he press Biden. It was so obvious. Just about everything Biden said was absolute bullshit as usual. Trump had to defend himself. Otherwise, game over."
3769,j2clx9,"It was embarrassing watching the candidate I support performing this way. I love his boldness, but I wish he‚Äôd use a bit of class and respect at the debate stage. He did well making Biden upset, but I would have preferred him looking like an enourmas idiot to him being annoyed"
3770,j2clx9,What gaffes? I thought Biden was incoherent and unable to put together a sentence prior to the debate but I thought he shed that narrative pretty well.
3771,j2clx9,I mean....is that seriously what you want from a president though? Someone who‚Äôs best value is when they aren‚Äôt talking?
3772,j2clx9,"Yes but the only answer Trump did not answer was the 750 fed taxes he kept generalizing 

Biden on the other hand had a few time with dogging questions and one time with a straight no I‚Äôm not answer that üòõ 

What people don‚Äôt understand about trumps health care plan is it‚Äôs not a 100% let‚Äôs change everything! It is let‚Äôs keep what we have and better it! Now not exactly what I would want because I would like regulations on prices caps. But I‚Äôm ok trying this, way better then Obama care which I couldn‚Äôt get my discount because me and my husband file taxes separately. So I‚Äôm already missing out on my marriages tax discount but let‚Äôs not help with the Obama care discount too."
3773,j2clx9,[deleted]
3774,j2clx9,"> If Trump just shut the fuck up and let Biden humiliate himself with his gaffes, this would've gone a lot better.

Absolutely not. Joe Biden isn't Hilary Clinton and it's a mistake to underestimate him. He's still the same old pair of shiny teeth he was in the 1970s. There's never a single fact when it comes to Biden's talking points, it's: smile, look at the camera, tug at the heartstrings. 

He did it a few times when Trump was leashed, ""How many of you are sitting down to dinner with an empty seat?"" And it's that sad sappy crap that sways voters. No one cares about the gaffes or the policy. 

Trump was right to steamroll Biden. It plays into **his** talking points. ""Sure, ol' Joe is a moderate, but he's weak and the Democratic party will walk all over him."" I think if there's one thing people walked away with, it's if Biden can't even get a word in edgewise against Trump, what hope does he have against the radical left?"
3775,j2clx9,Fucking sucks. Trump needed to let him dig his own grave. He saved him multiple times.
3776,j2clx9,I was so mad I had to walk away. My wife and MIL were in the room and I started using foul language.
3777,j2clx9,"He said he spoke for the Democrats, he is their elected Presidentl Candidate. Trump did call them they told him they didnt need his help."
3778,j2clx9,"Well you'd think Joe Biden would still be able to call these democrats up and say, ""Hey, get your cities under control. You're making me (eg. The democratic party) look bad!""

But I guess Biden would rather continue his virtue signaling of BLM instead of support law and order."
3779,j2clx9,As if being a former VP doesn‚Äôt give you the right to call other politicians....

3783,j2clx9,As if Biden would actually be the one making the decisions if he was to become President. C'mon man.

What would be the solution for such an occasion where both parties no longer engage in reasonable debate, but merely respond to whomever said it?

He did manage it once during this debate, when he rattled off how many police groups support him then asked Joe which one's have endorsed his candidacy.  He needed more moments like that and a bit fewer just calling out Bidens lies.  Of course Biden is going to lie, it's all he has, but when trump interrupts every single lie when it happens like last night it doesn't help his campaign all that much."

3811,j2clx9,"He was squinting and looking down to the left just about every time he spoke. Almost as if he were reading something, a prompter perhaps? He also didn‚Äôt actually answer any of the questions. Just canned appeals to emotion that the left eats up. He definitely didn‚Äôt coherently answer anything Trump asked him, likely because he didn‚Äôt have a rehearsed answer. Just dodges and insults. Did you miss the incoherent mess as he attempted to explain his energy policies? Wallace had to jump in and feed him his position. That‚Äôs just off the top of my head. Not to mention that Wallace held his hand throughout entirety of the debate while he spouted lie after lie after lie. I‚Äôm not saying Trump hit it out of park, he should have shut his trap and given Biden more rope. That said, if you missed all the Biden gaffs you weren‚Äôt paying attention."
3812,j2clx9,"He did do very well, relatively speaking, but he still had a few minor mixups. The main issue I took with his performance was that he never directly answered any questions. He never gave what he would do or his plan for the topic. All he ever did was say Trump messed up and Obama and him did perfectly. That is not something I want in a President: someone who only blames someone else for the problems and evade any sort of responsibility."

After that, he all of a sudden became an expert on energy and was given positions on boards of foreign companies. Then financial transactions ramped up. But that's ok. I'm sure he was an excellent consultant on matters he knew nothing about therefore his payouts are justified right? Meanwhile, 50 million dollars later and 2 years of a special counsel couldn't find shit on Trump and foreign collusion. However, they tried to impeach him over it. There is no defending Biden or his son on their significant benefits from foreign ""donations""."

3838,j2clx9,He was reviewing facts and taking notes on what Trump was saying most likely.
3839,j2clx9,In my eyes that‚Äôs just how presidential debates work. No one wants to answer the questions because they‚Äôll alienate someone. Neither candidate answered their questions on Tuesday and past presidential candidates on both sides didn‚Äôt either.

You really think a fail son like Hunter has any pull with his dad?   Also Trump has installed his family members in cabinet roles that they have no experience in.

3979,hjhq2k,"It's obviously a little subjective but the wikis are pretty interesting and well worth the read https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)

Switched is perhaps an exaggeration but I think they mean how the democrats went from wanting a limited government and supporting business rights to supporting government intervention and social programs following the new deal:

""In its early years, the Party supported¬†limited government, state sovereignty, and¬†slavery, while opposing banks""

""Well into the 20th century, the party had¬†conservative¬†pro-business and Southern conservative-populist wings; following the New Deal, however, the conservative wing of the party largely withered outside the South.¬†""

Meanwhile the Republican party initially

""Called for economic and social¬†modernization""

""The Republican Civil War era program included free homestead farms, a federally subsidized transcontinental railroad, a national banking system, a large national debt, land grants for higher education, a new national banking system, a wartime income tax and permanent high tariffs to promote industrial growth and high wages...They created the foundations of the modern welfare state through an extensive program of pensions for Union veterans.""

Plus the demographic swap:

""After the¬†Civil Rights Act of 1964¬†and the¬†Voting Rights Act of 1965, the core bases of the two parties shifted, with the¬†Southern states¬†becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic.""

Obviously the world changes and the manifestation of core principals in the form of policy need to change as well. So you can argue the core principals haven't changed but I personally see some distinct shifts between the two parties over time

You should be appalled. You're reading CNN so of course it leaves out that it's a replica of the Emancipation Memorial, which was paid for entirely by freed slaves.

""The funding drive for the monument began, according to much-publicized newspaper accounts from the era, with $5 given by former slave Charlotte Scott of¬†Virginia, then residing with the family of her former master in Marietta, Ohio, for the purpose of creating a memorial honoring Lincoln.[6][7]¬†The¬†Western Sanitary Commission, a¬†St. Louis-basedvolunteer¬†war-relief agency, joined the effort and raised some $20,000 before announcing a new $50,000 goal.[8]

According to the National Park Service, the monument was paid for¬†solely¬†by former slave.""

You see, this is exactly the problem. Nobody knows anything anymore. Everyone is just repeating stupid stuff they heard somewhere or saw online, and that just perpetuates more stupidity. 

If this statue was paid for by people who were actual fucking slaves, then who the hell are any of us to take it down?

3986,hjhq2k,"And FWIW, you do know that yes, white people practically stamped out slavery. Slavery WAS a UNIVERSAL human institution prior to religious Christians using the might of the British Navy to end the slave trade. They were successful too, except for the overland route from Africa to Arabia which had so many corpses that it was said that if you didn‚Äôt know the way, you could LITERALLY follow the trail of corpses. 


Later came the task of freeing the existing slaves in the US (which was not as much of a problem in other parts of the world because the slaves had reduced rates of reproduction and higher maternal and child mortality) which was only possible when religious Christians coalesced into a movement of abolitionists that became the Republican Party and fought a bloody and costly war to free the slaves. 

I don‚Äôt disagree that the slaves SHOULD have been free to begin with. But the idea that should and are don‚Äôt happen without major sacrifice is ahistorical. If American GI‚Äôs didn‚Äôt storm the beaches of Normandy, there probably would be a Jew left in Europe, if not the world. All the ‚Äúundesirables‚Äù SHOULD NOT have been tortured and murdered. But it was only through the sacrifice of the Allies that those heinous acts were stopped."

Lastly, while it's been a little different in the last two years, eliminating a large national debt has been a staple of the party for a while, so that seems like a complete reversal.

4035,hjhq2k,"You're living in a fantasy, nobody wants segregation. Just *in this moment* it's nice for *some* of them to have a space they feel truly safe in, it's more symbolic than literal. We've already done the white way around anyway, it was shit.

You're lumping every leftist into the same group, ignoring the differences in opinion between us. Some leftists hate the CHAZ because it's an autonomous zone, some people love it for the same reason. Some people think race relations are important, some think class conflict would solve the whole ordeal. There's not one leftist agenda, and it certainly wouldn't be segregation even if it did exist outside of your brain."

4044,hjhq2k,How do you argue what most normal people think that when there is a literal vote that proves different? Please explain the mental gymnastics to get around that.
4045,hjhq2k,You cant be serious.
4046,hjhq2k,it's not autonomous.. That's why they renamed it to the CHOP. Because they want all the benefits but none of the responsibility
4047,hjhq2k,"‚ÄúBlack only spaces‚Äù is literally segregation. And those two black kids ended up feeling real safe in CHAZ after they got shot didn‚Äôt they? They sound exactly like racist whites in the 60‚Äôs trying to keep black kids out of schools. ‚ÄúWe've already done the white way around anyway, it was shit.‚Äù So it‚Äôs all really about doing it the black way around now? They just want revenge and to be able to treat whites like blacks were treated decades ago."
4048,hjhq2k,Liberal from a dictionary stand point just mean open to new ideas and change. Early Republicans were extremely liberal.

4056,hjhq2k,"Of course not, but I'm sick and tired of having the same people who throw arguments, like the ones I used sarcastically, at me for supporting the Republican party or Lincoln, get away with it. I thought it would be nice to see what they think of that sort of treatment."
4057,hjhq2k,"Not what we're talking about, the article was about how white people symbolically want to protect them instead of just standing by and doing nothing. They don't *need* the protection, it's just a gesture of showing you want to help people out in this scenario. And for Christ's sake can you give them a break? They tried to do something good and all you can focus on is the filthy leftists that happened to be in there."

I cannot find the creator whom I wish to credit (I posted this with a link to whoever I thought it was only to realize they were discrediting it as theirs). I apologize if you think I did. It was sent to me by a conservative friend who knows I blog about similar frustrations.

I posted it though as a conversation starter and a way to vent as an accurate depiction of what we, minority political conservatives, have to deal with.

The black community is not Monolithic, as the Left would have you believe - ironically denoting their own real racism. We are not suddenly not black when we profess conservative values.

As an Asian/Hispanic conservative, I‚Äôve tried showing my opinions about the current situation on social media and was bombarded with hate from black leftists thinking I‚Äôm brainwashed or self hating. You‚Äôre allowed to have an opinion. Jeez. Props to you for sticking to it, girl!"
4070,gwol7q,"I am curious on how you feel about the college admissions system letting in different races based on set scores for those races. For example, for an Asian American to get into a college they need much higher SAT and ACT score to get in. Rather than an African American person would going to the same college. I personally think that race should be taken out of the equation and have it all be based on how you stand up to other applicants not depending on race but on how hard you worked through high school. Just curious on where you stand?:)"
4071,gwol7q,Sorry to hear you get even more marginalized.  Props for sticking to your beliefs!
4072,gwol7q,I've heard black Conservatives also get a lot of shit from their black peers who vote Democrat.

I don‚Äôt think that the Republican Party is like that at all.  Growing the economy benefits everyone, not just certain groups."
4077,gwol7q,"As a first generation ‚Äúminority‚Äù I guess, I like how the Republican Party doesn‚Äôt attempt to pander to us (I‚Äôm sure some do whatever). But in general, they speak to all Americans. I‚Äôm not defined by my skin color. We‚Äôre free to embrace our heritage as Americans and I‚Äôm all for that but my heritage doesn‚Äôt define me either. What defines people are their beliefs, values and virtues and the left seems to weaponize this and pit us against one another. I refuse to fight in the oppression octagon that is liberalism. 

I used to be a hard core liberal until I realized that they were the people I despised all along."

4079,gwol7q,"The whole idea of being a ‚Äúrace traitor‚Äù is racist. Beliefs change person to person, not race to race."
4080,gwol7q,"I love this post. I think it's awesome that we conservative types can all bond over liberals condescending to us and laughing at how racist they don't realize they are :) 

I've had on my heart for sometime now the desire to get out and just be with other like minded folks of all races especially but any faith or sexual orientation, too. I want to do this publicly, just getting to know each other and doing it out in public for all to see. I want to let people know that we conservatives are out there, we are colorful, and we enjoy life and we can do it together. And maybe we could reach out to people in the communities where we meet up and talk about conservative values together, but mostly just to be out together, getting to know one another. I mean it feels strangely racist to specifically seek out people of color, but at the same time the point is not our colors, it is to come together around shared values, to network, and to enjoy life.

Now, I must be honest, I have black friends but not many, nor many Hispanic friends, and none of them are very close. So I don't know how to broach this kind of topic. Most of the people of color I know are high school friends I haven't spoken with in years. But I would love to start some kind of meet up for conservatives of all types to come together in various localities just to go and hang out at a beach together, have a little cook out, things like that. I really just want to be friends, I need more conservative friends anyway. I don't give a shit about anyone's race, I never have, I just never made many friends who weren't white. And while I don't want to make friends just because someone is black or Hispanic or Asian or whatever, I think this country needs it and we conservatives just generally need to come out of the woodwork more and be seen in more liberal places.

The other thing that has been stopping me is I can be a huge fucking dork/nerd hahaha. I mean I'm a fun guy but man oh man. And I live in New York State which is blue through and through."
4081,gwol7q,"I hate to inform you but according to Super Thursday Joe Biden you ain‚Äôt black, like he determines race. It always makes me proud to see people of all races and backgrounds support trump"

All they do is shame and bully and pretend to care about equality. It‚Äôs all a show and the sheeple are so easily herded. People don‚Äôt think, they just read headlines and believe. I consider myself a liberal, but the Democratic Party simply does not represent my values any more. Look what‚Äôs happening in these blue cities of rioters. Keep standing up for your beliefs and let the ignorant herds see for themselves that the Dems just simply want their vote and that‚Äôs it."

All this will be gone after election, but the free media treated us like we are animals which does not need independent thinking. I fell suffocated. I cannot breath from BLM, from left, Media, and Democrats. 

I never vote before, and not a Republican. I am pushed to be anti-democratic, and I start my never-democratic journey in my life.

I will never ever go anything about BLM, Democratic, or Obama.

I‚Äôm asian and he‚Äôs australian, he‚Äôs more liberal while I‚Äôm more conservative and the recent event really got him fired up. We usually don‚Äôt talk about politics but I usually go for the fence opinion because I truly love him and I didn‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings (because he‚Äôs easy to get hurt)

He wanted to burn the society down, calling every whites are racist etc. I try to calm him down but he just go more toxic more and more as the riot goes. I said that stereotype rhetoric isn‚Äôt helping anyone, and that rioting ends up hurting innocents and bystanders. Hell, it ended up ruining more colored people livelihoods.

He marked me as a capitalist pig, saying that every revolution is always paid in blood. That society can always be rebuilt from the ash, then he began to use my religion against me by saying Jesus wouldn‚Äôt do this etc (I said that Jesus is also against harming lives and thievery.)

He finally got tired of me and revealed that he‚Äôs been cheating behind my back, saying that his close friend makes a better boyfriend and lover in bed. He blocked me on everything afterwards and deleted the chat off telegram before I can screenshot it.

I‚Äôm pretty devastated by this, how another country‚Äôs riot ended up making me lose my boyfriend, found out he‚Äôs a cheater behind my back and now a lot of my online contacts are blocking me because of a false rumours he spreads. (Apparently I cheated on him and that I supported the killing of the innocent man.)

I only think it is stupid, because no one is truly ""oppressed"" anymore. Not in America at least, and slavery hasn't even been around since 1865. Plus, it's not like these protests will accomplish anything. I mean I get it, every teenage girl in the world is screaming ""Black lives matter!"" At the the side of the street. But what are they protesting? That is a statement but not one to change anything. Besides, the reason they are protesting it is because of one incident they may have even been changed by the media. It isn't like the whole country is like that one cop. I'm so done with all that's going on right now. I'm sorry for going on about this, and to the original poster. Thank you for having your own opinions.

(Also I'm not saying that black lives do not matter, as they do. All lives matter. I don't like that there is a completely separate organization for Black Lives matter as all we need is All Lives matter but eh, it's whatever. I'm just saying that it is stupid to ""protest"" this while thing)"

4144,gwol7q,"All too relatable, I am often told my own heritage doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúclaim‚Äù me because I don‚Äôt agree with their political views. It‚Äôs blatant racism but it‚Äôs racism that fits their agenda so it gets a ‚Äúpass‚Äù per say."
4145,gwol7q,"I believe it is a form of underhanded racism. Affirmative action, at one point, was designed to overcome lasting ills. It ran its course and any current existing issues can be explained squarely on the ongoing self harming culture sustained in the inner city minority communities.

Now continuing it in another form is just racism disguised as equality. It is saying I am incapable of doing it on my own - here is a helping hand! Not even taking into account anything else but my race. I want to be treated equally not special just because I have more melanin."
4146,gwol7q,"So if you look at college entrance exams broken down by race and gender, whether SAT or GRE for grad school, there are obvious differences in their aggregate scores. At face value, some people would say this means your race and gender dictates your IQ.

Which is obviously (i hope) bullshit.

It is, however, indicative of a problem with something else.

Is it the test that's biased? Possibly. If you look some math and science questions from concept inventories, a lot of questions use sports analogies. This could be argued as a biased question, as not all students solving this question are familiar with said sport and thus don't fully understand the question. This is largely cited as an example of how standardized tests are biased against women.

Is it indicative of unequal access to preparatory education? If you come from a crappy school, you probably don't have the same opportunities to take prep classes, AP classes, etc, thus scoring lower. Since schools are funded on property taxes most of the time, this creates a disparity in scores based on socioeconomic status (which is arguably correlated with race)

Meanwhile, our Asian students are scoring higher. Is this because they're actually smarter or because their parents perpetuate a culture of study study study? 

In conclusion, when it comes to standardized test scores, they are not indicative of ability (like they claim to be), but rather preparation. If you subscribe to a growth mindset (like i do), this exam score could be actively hindering a phenomenal student from getting into college, where they can flourish, because they didn't have adequate preparation. Which is why applications are supposed to be holistic and judge the student based on a number of metrics, not just scores."

4251,gwol7q,"Thanks!

I stopped following the news when all the left news outlets were all just fear-mongering about the coronavirus so I wasn‚Äôt aware of those articles. Not surprising though.

I think I‚Äôm going to delete Instagram."
4252,gwol7q,"Really got me there, man"
4253,gwol7q,"True though. I tried to explaining to my white leftist friend how there are very valid reasons to be protesting- like say, how murder is bad and bad cops need to be tried, how crime is proportional to income and black urban communities are disproportionately poor, thanks to antiquated zoning laws, the vicious cycle of having public education tied to property taxes, etc- but that I don't support looting and burning down BLACK BUSINESSES because it just makes shit worse. 

&#x200B;

I got LIT. UP. about how I value property over black lives and thus am super racist. Like, nah, I think murdering people is bad, I think shitty education is bad, I think protecting bad cops is bad, and I also think burning down innocent peoples stuff is bad. Like... just because I think something is bad does not mean I also don't think the other thing is bad, too. Damn."
4254,gwol7q,Because people like you are too dense to to get the message. No shit all lives matter nobody disagrees with that. But as one of the subs pics that posted was trending. Black lives are at the bottom and catch the most shit in a political sense. Ethically no shit all alive matter. It's a statement that black lives matter.

4260,gwol7q,"Part of the problem is that the actual death rate isn‚Äôt all that well known. In the US, the death rate is 6% of positive cases. And since many cases are undetected due to both how it is asymptotic in some people, how we were way slow on testing and have gone out of our way to muddy the data, it just isn‚Äôt really that well known.  But one thing about it that is different than your examples of swimming etc. are that for one you are choosing and accepting risk for yourself. The other is choosing how much risk you are willing to put others at. There‚Äôs always a balancing act, but with something that was presenting itself as pretty catastrophic early on, especially for anyone who isn‚Äôt at peak health, it is way more than just insensitive to casually dismiss potential harm. 

My daughter, for example, is fighting cancer right now, and my mother has her own health concerns. If I were to say, screw it, I‚Äôm probably fine, so I‚Äôll go get my hair cut because that‚Äôs more important to me than them, who would very likely die if I brought Covid back to them, would you really say that was the right call? Right now there are millions of people like me and my daughter and mom out there and covid has shown itself to be far more deadly than the flu. 

If we really cared about balancing the economic harm to the medical harm, we would only be able to do that with more, not less, knowledge about this. Instead of just saying ‚Äúlet ‚Äòer rip.‚Äù

Wouldn‚Äôt you rather we make data and not drama driven decisions?"

I understand your comments to be saying that this cartoon is not how actual people are silencing black conservatives. (Correct me if I am wrong)


And I disagree, based on my personal experiences witnessing white college leftists actively telling black conservatives that they are so brainwashed that they don't see their oppression,  instead of listening to them. That being black conservative means you are a ""race traitor"", an ""uncle tom"", and all kinds of other racist shit for having different political views. 

These same white leftists who then tear into a POC for expressing how he cannot draw a line in the sand, because he has friends who are cops and doesn't want to see them hurt."

As you said the death rate is largely unknown, I wouldn't say it's quite as high as 6% but we can not be for certain with all of the manipulating going on. One thing is certain this wasn't the catastrophic disease it was being touted to be. I am to be driven by data but at the moment I'm tired of the current situation we are in. I'm not able to work because of this virus. I just got my degree that put financial stress on my family for years.i should be able to find a job. All the while we are told to stay home by the same people who are in large groups protesting and ignoring the vary restrictions they preached so fervently just a few weeks ago. This pandemic was handled poorly due to many more factors than I even want to get into. The fault lies with almost every politician and the media. That said I feel for you and your family and their struggles. In this scenarios it is extremely wise to avoid unnecessary trips into the public. I didn't mean for my comment to come across ad so arbitrary and in the face of anyone impacted by this virus.
On a side note I deleted my original comment as without the original it lost all context."

Top rated comment in r/uplifitingnews while they disagree with kanyes political views they praised him for it. Nobody ever said you can't make up or believe in what you want. In the same token you can't be an idiot either. Statics are statistics and water is a state of being wet. You can have a confirmed bias. But if you blatantly ignore data for the sake of denying it you're an idiot. People like that are not to be reasoned with. If you don't want to read statistics because CNN or MSNBC says it then you are just dumb. Even a liar has to tell the truth. There's no denying certain things. If everything is up in the air for debate then what is real then.

4273,gwol7q,"Hahaha I live in Cambridge MA. MIT students had to flood the local ICE office with complaints to prevent raids on a campus staffer who, like me and you it seems, is a Hispanic American citizen."
4274,gwol7q,"The key thing I want to point out (besides thanks for your kind words) is that it isn‚Äôt the people protesting or Democrats that are saying to stay home. It is the scientific community saying that and the Democrats are largely just deferring to their expertise. 

The protesters may be predominantly democratic, but if that‚Äôs so, it‚Äôs because they are the ones most offended by clear systemic policing abuse and a system clearly constructed to put police above the law. Everyone should be for a better trained police force that doesn‚Äôt default to violence and are actually accountable to their actions.

But regardless of that, most protesters are and have always been young and reckless. This protest IS reckless in context of the pandemic, but I can easily see someone doing the math and saying some things are worth it. And I can see why this would be one of those. 

And by the way, I say this as someone who supports the police, but just feel it needs a significant overhaul."
4275,gwol7q,"Well if we want to talk statistics I'd be happy to pull up the ones that say you're more likely to be shot by a cop if you're white, you're 18.5x more likely to be shot by a black man if you're a cop than a black man by a cop, how black men are 6% of the population but commit more than 40% of murders, etc.

Police brutality for what should be routine procedures I will concede is higher with black citizens based on survey data. 

Notice how no one here has said the reason for the protests, the murder of Floyd and unnecessary police force, aren't worthy of fighting against. It's completely invalidating every other nuanced opinion (such as burning down buildings is bad) that is somehow not a valid opinion because leftists say it invalidates the whole thing. Meanwhile righties also say burning down buildings invalidates the whole protest. So here we are."

4278,gwol7q,So what. It happened once in a blue moon. I lived my enter life in the North East and never felt a need to walk around with my passport.
4279,gwol7q,"In the beginning I was entirely for the scientific recommendations, I majored in Emergency Management and it coincided with a lot of class work and was quite interested in seeing how it would be handled. Pandemics are not very common and hard to get a chance to study one. The issue I had/have is the large amounts of misinformation and disagreement among the scientific and medical communities. When presented with inconsistency in the field proper procedure is hard to determine,even more so when your experts begin to disagree as more information is released. The largest issue I had is the immediate jump to the worst case being the truth. While we are trained to present the worst, so in the event it happens people are prepared, there was too many people saying that this was absolutely a worst case scenario. Mix that with the rampant fear mongering and it really derailed a lot. Not only that now we have distrust growing for officials and experts. 
On the protesting side of things I agree things could add up to make it worth it. As you said it's a lot of young and reckless people acting out. This is also driven by unchecked emotions and a lack of patience. I appreciate that you support the police force in our country, I have have a lot of family currently on the force and i am greatly concerned for them during this. I am, as you are, concerned for the lack of restraint some officers exhibit and fell there is a need for a reform as well. I do not think it is so much a systemic issue as much as the bad apples are just louder in this situation as well as a possible lack in training and definitely not enough accountability. I love our police officers and value their sacrifice and while I feel reform is needed violence against them will only deepen wounds and distrust that is already rampant."

Once in a blue moon?? Just tell me the number haha. I've got as many stories as you want. New Jersey, Mass, Maine, Florida, Texas, Nevada, California, Washington, just off the top of my head.

You think it's acceptable that this happens even once?"
4283,gwol7q,"Yeah, it‚Äôs hard to get to real truth when ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are considered political, and there is too much agenda pushing on both sides to be comfortable, but that said, both sides aren‚Äôt being equally dishonest, but I can forgive someone for thinking that. I mean, Fox News is literally just propaganda at this point, but then again some shows on channels like MSNBC are pretty obviously also pushing a counter narrative. But those are all entertainment shows masquerading as news. NPR or The Economist tend to be the most unbiased that I‚Äôve found for mostly agenda free information. 

As far as the police go, the current culture is very tribal, not unlike politics these days, so even ‚Äúgood‚Äù cops will usually stand by or even protect ‚Äúbad‚Äù cops, not unlike how some people in my family would blindly support others in the family who were clearly in the wrong. The whole blood is thicker than water thing, you know? Well, the current police culture strongly encourages that mindset combined with engraining an over abundance of caution that borders on paranoia. 
After time it‚Äôs easy to blanket paint everyone with the same brush. Everyone is dangerous and a potential threat so it‚Äôs safer to aggressively handle all situations and maintain control. But we only really teach forceful methods to do this so even well meaning cops will choose forceful rather than deescalating tactics because they just don‚Äôt know any better. Then you have the ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù who are immune from consequences, due to an over-powerful union. Since they stick around, they continue to influence and perpetuate a culture that that is okay. 

It seems that you agree with some of that (lack of training etc.) and I would argue that that combined with protections ARE systemic factors. The fact that cops are allowed to turn off cameras and cover their badges ARE systemic flaws that if fixed would let police do much more good for society."
4284,gwol7q,"Sorry for the follow up, but here‚Äôs a topical case in point....yesterday a police officer forcibly threw an old man and long time pacifist who has walked up calmly to the officer. The man received significant head trauma, which is life threatening for a man his age. At no point did any of the officers attempt to help beyond calling an ambulance despite him bleeding from the ears and him being unconscious. 

The officers lied about the incident, saying that he just tripped, but since it was filmed and was becoming a focal point for abuse, the two officers involved were put on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. 

In response to this, the 57 fellow officers who were on that task force quit that special task force (but not the police force) because they feel the officer was treated unfairly and because they were just following orders. Forget the failed Nuremberg war crime defense for a minute, and just let it sink in that the entire group of police are protesting, in their own way, any accountability or oversight. This stops being just a couple bad apples who over-reacted when all of their department rush to protect them and help cover up their extreme abuse of power. 

This is just one example, but gets to the point that this is systemic in nature and not just a one off situation."

4299,i23528,"When Obama came into office unemployment was 8% and climbing, GDP was negative, and the annual deficit was $1.6 trillion. When Obama left unemployment was 4.2% and falling, GDP was 2.7%, and the nation deficit was $600 billion.

Those number from Obama were viewed as not good enough. While unemployment had come down the work participation rate hadn't moved, GDP should have been double what it was, and $600 Billion was still $600 billion too much. Trump campaigned on increasing the work participation rate, doubling GDP, and eliminating the deficit. Sadly none of that has happened. Unemployment followed its existing trend down, GDP stayed where it was, and the national deficit has exploded into a territory I didn't even think was possible. 

Memes aren't enough. We have a $6 trillion deficit and the year isn't even over yet. Unemployment is at 14% and GDP is negative. What are we going to do? What is the plan?"

4333,i23528,"The Obama administration did still put strain on race relations and general partisanship, especially when Obama had the supermajority in Congress.

Also, shoved his Obamacare thing down our throat which was bad for the country too, huge waste of money. The concept of universal Healthcare is very desirable. But to try to shoe horn it in an economy that revolves around super greed may not be possible and we saw that. Trump invested in farmers and fishermen in the northeast as well as other moves to invigorate domestic production. He fixed some horrible trade deals that were made under Obama and other presidents before him. The economy and employment (especially for minorities) were at amazing levels under Trump and due to Trump. Biden is a zero sum politician. He's weak and goes where the wind blows (or a young intern if you know what I'm sayin). His many racist comments and actions over the decades compared to what he's saying now should be crystal clear examples of that. Trump is abrasive and not necessarily someone to look for as an example of turn the other cheek or be a slick talking politician, but he made Amefcia Great Again and can do it again after Covid."

14 million jobs were added between 2008, the low point of the financial crisis, and 2016. It was the longest string of consecutive monthly jobs gains in economic history.

4480,ilfugm,all of them!
4481,ilfugm,I've spent 8 years in higher education thus far getting different degrees. I have met wayyyy to many.
4482,ilfugm,They are common at university
4483,ilfugm,"I can't speak for him, but my guess is that it's because they make it a major public mark of their place on the spectrum of identity politics.  And many of the people who claim it aren't actually what they claim to be.  They are just someone who is adopting the label for personal gain in the left wing community.  Sympathy whoring, basically.  

Let me put it to you this way.  Let's say you're scrolling through a social media app like Tik Tok.  You come across a video of a young woman singing.  Let's say it's just a nice, fun video.  She's not doing a controversial song or anything like that.  Let's say she's singing Take It Easy by The Eagles.  It's fun.  But down at the bottom, it is carrying the hashtags ""lgbt,"" ""bisexual,"" and ""pride.""  

Okay.  So, now we're all wondering just what those hashtags have to do with the video, right?  I mean, the song isn't about those things.  At all.  She has no other form of messaging in the video indicating that there is a social or political idea being communicated.  It's just... there.  This random bit of words telling the world who she'd like to sleep with.  Why?  It feels like she's and others are just putting those hashtags on everything so that the social media algorithm will think I am looking for those types of things.  But I'm not.  I'm looking for people singing classic rock songs.  But now that I watched her video all the way through, I get ten videos everyday about LGBT issues that I never expressed an issue in. 

So, that's why **I** sometimes put sexual orientation in quotes.  It's because I don't really believe the people putting it out there the way that they do.  If they do mean it, I think there's something weird about just declaring the type of people you want to sleep with even when doing completely unrelated activities like singing.  And it feels to me more like a perverse attempt to have my web browsing invaded by propaganda for their political agenda.  So, I put it in quotes.  I don't believe it's genuine.  I think people are more inclined to compartmentalize their sex lives and their social hobbies, and someone who gets the urge to sing a song from The Eagles does so without feeling compelled to say, ""Hey!  I sleep with men **and** women!"""

4539,ilfugm,"Joe Biden said black people lack diversity so how can both things be true?

As far as black/minority representation in the Congress, shouldn't it be the best person gets the job, and race,color,sex or orientation shouldn't matter?  

So to say that Republicans are somehow racist because they dont have a bunch of minorities sitting in house seats is just dumb as any ""racist"" organization would have zero representation everywhere and that certainly isnt the case with Republicans in any state in the nation.  Each state has black leaders that are republican sitting in some seat of leadership.  Could be Sheriff, Judges, State House/Senate, Attorney General, something in every state.  

But I do know for Senators, there is only 2 black democrat senators and 1 black republican senator.  So, hardly some huge disparity, as one of those democrat senators is Kamala Harris, not sure she really counts anymore now that shes running for V.P.  But if she looses, then she will regain her seat, so yeah... 2...   

The house is a bit large, I aint doing that research, but I do know that this 116th Congress has the largest collection of minorities ever.  But again, their job approval rating is below 40% (last I checked), so maybe we should be focusing on who is actually doing things instead of skin color?"

4545,ilfugm,"TIL Tim Scott, US Senator from South Carolina doesn't exist.  

There are actually TONS of Conservative voices that are black, regardless of whether they are in Congress or not.  In fact, I watch and listen to more black voices when it comes to political commentary than I do white voices (this is just a happenstance, as I don't look at color, and just seek out good voices that speak truth, as color shouldn't be an issue to begin with.)  The left likes to discredit Conservative black voices, but hey, that's what racists do, and the left has always been the side of racists.  Thomas Sowell (one of the most brilliant people alive, and a former Democrat), Ben Carson, the aforementioned Tim Scott, Candace Owens, Brandon Tatum, Candace Owens, the Hodge Twins, Terrence K Williams.  All great black voices, and all of them denounce the idea of systemic black oppression.  And these are just some of the voices out there.  The only thing that is systemic, is the welfare system, where the aim is to subjugate, and keep black lives dependent on, and indebted to the government, in order to secure their votes.  It's an insidious form of manipulation and racism, really...  

BTW, the lack of black people in the GOP is unfortunate, but I do believe that is something that is going to be changing more and more.  I know we've consistently had black candidates in the GOP primaries, and I've often voted for them personally.  Sadly, they didn't make it out of the primary yet.  But I believe that day is coming as well! 

As for the Police profiling issue, I think people need to stop getting upset over that, and realize that there was literally a show on TV called ""Profiler"", because that's an integral and important part of how law enforcement does its job.  They use stats, and predictive data, to better solve crimes, and prevent crimes.  The fact that black men commit over 50% of the violent crimes here in America IS going to naturally result in them being scrutinized differently. But the solution to that problem isn't to ask the cops to ignore that fact, and pretend it isn't true.  No, the way to solve that issue, is for the black community to work among themselves on fixing the issues that are causing that stat to be true.  The disintegration of the family, and the absence of a strong father figure in many young black men's lives is a big part of it, that's for sure.  And lest you say I'm not qualified to speak to that matter, the things I'm telling you are coming from those black voices I mentioned earlier, from their personal experience.  Getting back to the profiling issue, it cuts both ways.  If a serial killer is on the loose in my area, the Police are not going to be looking for a black man.  They're going to be looking for somebody who looks just like me.  That's a fact.  I may not like being profiled that way, but it's a reality of the stats, and the way the profiling system works.  And it's proven effective in curtailing crime, at least to an extent."
4546,ilfugm,You remind me of the babe!
4547,ilfugm,"Again, you're not correct about how the algorithm works.  If I watch the video for the music, I get more of everything in the tags.  It doesn't even matter if I like it or not.  Simply watching it over a certain length of time boosts the amount I'll see videos related to the tags. 

You fail to realize that tagging things this way is rather pervasive.  And if you're singing a song about space travel, why are you only trying to attract LGBT viewers?  And if you are, there's better venues for that.  And if you are, how in the hell is anyone a bigot for disliking your video?  I mean, you're not the target, right?  You just said she's tagging that way because she wants LGBT viewers.  Well, that's not me, and I'm not on a video app to watch sociopolitical issues.  So what about me blocking or disliking the video makes me a bigot?  Why am I not allowed to manipulate the algorithm to my own interests?"
4548,ilfugm,"Since you're bi, let me ask you a series of questions that I've never heard a good answer to.  Maybe you can provide one.  Most of the time when I ask, though, I just get anger and accusations about my motives.  But truth is I'm genuinely curious. 

So, if you're bi and you decide to make content on an app (doesn't matter which, YouTube, TikTok, etc.), what compels you to tag it as LGBT?  Let's say it's about something not political at all.  Let's say it's about golf.  So, you're posting a video of you making a great chip shot.  Great!  That's awesome, and golfers everywhere will be thrilled to see it.  But, you tag it LGBT for... what reason?  

In another post, you said it's because you want ""your community"" to see it.  But, wouldn't any LGBT community member who likes golf automatically see it just by virtue of looking for things related to golf?  I mean, what exactly does it say for you to tag it that way?  Are you **only** wanting gay or bi golfers to see it?  If so, why?  Why wouldn't straight golfers enjoy it?  After all, it's just you making a great shot.  It's not you going on a political tirade or anything like that.  It's literally just golf.  Is there something more special about a gay upvote over a straight one?  Do you get notified if a gay person clicks the up arrow (obviously, you don't, so that question is rhetorical)?  

So, I guess the same response goes to you.  You, the content creator, can't tell if an upvote is gay or straight.  Why tag it along those lines if it has nothing to do with those issues?  What are you trying to accomplish?  And if it's really just to attract the gay community, what the heck draws the entire gay community to golf?"

It seems weird to me that people ""are"" a political party at all. Do you agree with all of, or even most of their policies? Are you a one issue voter? Is this what identities you as Republican? I'm really curious, and I'm hoping you'll let me know what you think. Thanks! Btw I got a chuckle out of this too :) Satire is supposed to be funny and frankly all satire is offensive to someone.

4655,i5evdt,Well. Basically I‚Äôm republican on mostly everything. Because I think the far right is a bit extreme for me. I‚Äôm basically republican because Democrats are a community that are tightly knit with a  communism set of values. Where they have this idea that the riches belong to everyone so the rich have an obligation to share whatever they have accumulated. and also that everyone should earn the same even  an engineer and a fast food worker. I‚Äôm not a rich person but I don‚Äôt envy the rich. As long as I can have a certain amount of rights and freedoms and a scertain set of opportunities I am cool with the system. Also the way the democrat party has turned into the past trump years have made many people cringe at their stupidity of the lengths they‚Äôll go to make trump lose the next election. Even if it means burning the whole country down by igniting a race war through their News Media and pumping BLM full of money.

4666,i5evdt,"Thank you for your reply.


I have no issue with some people making more money than others. People deserve to be rewarded for their hard work.

It turns out that almost all Americans agree on this issue. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM) on wealth distribution in the States. It doesn't pin blame on anyone. 

I am definitely a supporter of individual rights, just as you are. I definitely agree with you that News Media in the US divides the nation on purpose. They are businesses and make more money that way. It's shameful. Anyway, I appreciate your response."

4674,i5evdt,I think the problem with this post is that it implies the criminals running from the cops are black: you‚Äôd have to agree that is pretty racist since black people are not inherently criminals. Using Kaepernick‚Äôs form of peaceful protesting to round up black men to benefit police in this political landscape is in bad taste. This was literally denied to be offensive.

You guys have great arguments that I cannot really defend, but it just seems so hypocritical that you guys forget that being a conservative was supposed to be about fiscal responsibility, when conservatives have spent much more then Obama during these four years that have done nothing to increase American prosperity. What happened to fiscal responsibility? Why is every conservative I meet now know nothing about basic economics? What happened to you guys?"
4829,ijlosv,"To blame just him, yes that‚Äôs so wrong.

He has offered to help and the democrat governors and mayors say no. He is simply following the insurrection act by not intervening and putting his fist down without state/local permission.

And think about this,even if he did take down the insurrection act and send in federal police the democrats would call him a dictator, but they still blame him for not stopping the riots and looting."

The original premise was to flatten the curve of infection!
Why flatten the curve? To buy time so hospital(s) would be able to handle the case load for one thing.
To be able to learn more about it's transmission.
To learn what remediation can be employed to arrest the transmission.
To evaluate cause & effect.
To implement preventive measures.

Something else for you to ponder, why has their been no guidance from OSHA(state or federal) on the type and effectiveness of filtration material used on mask mandate(s) imposed by states?"
4856,ijlosv,"Just how did he down play it for political discord?

If I remember right, and I'm pretty sure I can bring the receipts to prove my point, while trying to be impeached he enacted a travel ban from the country of origin. It was the democrats and their propaganda organization(s) a.k.a., MSM that called him Xenophobic, Masagenist and racist, while Nasty Piglosi was in China town saying come on down everything is safe & secure, our President was putting together a task force to deal wirh the situation. A situation that all of the facts are NOT known yet! The one bitch I do have about the task Force is his choice of Dr Fauci, who has deep ties to Bill & Linda Gates. (Check out pandemic confrence @Davos 2019. Amazing Polly did outstanding research on it. Her channel on YouTube is well worth the time to watch if you want the facts and no opinion)

As for critical thinking speak for yourself, as I always ask: Why?, What's in it for those presenting the narrative? Who's going to enrich themselves? What am I going to lose? Is it ""A story"" or ""The story""? Skepticism keeps me from following the crowd, what will keep you from following the crowd?

As for defending our, not your as you stated, President's decisions, I did no such thing. I stated what is obvious to anyone with critical thinking does, I observed 3 different governors infer states rights during their own televised conferences the 10th amendment on the China virus like an edict from a monarch.

A little due diligence in your research on the subject would have led you to an answer that wasn't a precept of what you assume to be true."
4857,ijlosv,"The local governments are playing the political games...

You think the mayor of portland isn't encouraging what has been happening there for the last two plus months?"
4858,ijlosv,"Are you trying to fight here? I don't understand your ""Are you trying to start something?"" comment. If people saw your response here, you wouldn't have received upvotes on your first comment.

Further, I didn't say the ""minority"" are excused. But that ""minority"" is far larger than you think.

Second, if you go protest something for 3 months, it should be clear what you are protesting. The George Floyd arrest was not just a cop gunning some guy down, none of these cases are just some cop gunning someone down. They ALL resisted arrest. Most of them, while unarmed in the moment, were going for weapons. The protests erupted in the name of justice for Floyd, ALL the cops are facing trial and murder charges. That is the justice system working. And they deserve a fair trial, because the mob might be wrong about what they think they saw. So when you say you will not stop your ""values"", which values? Protesting something that is being resolved? Protesting another killing in which the guy was going for a knife and had assaulted the niece of the woman who called the cops on him?

By the way, the ""protesters"" and ""rioters"" must be distinguished, but unfortunately, many of the protesters and rioters are the same people. Many ""protesters"" just celebrated the murder of a man. There is video of it.

The truth of the matter is that our president isn't going to go down in history as being successful at containing the pandemic.  Whether or not it was the state government's missteps, it js not going to change that fact.  What do you think research is?  If you want to do research look at how much the pandemic has affected the United States versus other countries.  Also your coddling of silly terms and whiney insults like ""Nasty Piglosi"" knocks your credibility down another peg, this is also a tactic that our own president regrettably does.   He is a man with no tact, no empathy and very little ability to critically think; just like much of his voter base.

If you asked any sensible person ofcourse they‚Äôd say looting is bad and harming communities by looting shouldn‚Äôt be a thing, but I‚Äôd say just rioting isn‚Äôt so bad.

You have let the fear merchants cloud your thinking.
Have you done any risk assessment? NOPE. Have you done any research on why other countries have fared better? NOPE. You're just butt hurt because your argument got stomped on by facts and logic.

There's no garnish on my plate, just steak, potatoes & a vegetable butter salt&pepper. Under a Biden Presidency it would be beans six days a week and road kill on the 7th. You might want to keep that in mind before you vote.

4882,ijlosv,"You can bash semantics all day, he is our president, it was a slip.  But the virus is real, people are dying and being affected.  It doesn't surprise me that you do not value empathy if you cannot see the plight of others.  Just out of curiosity, what do you think of Bernie Sanders?"
4883,ijlosv,"> There are absolutely peaceful protestors who also support the violent

Support how? It's maybe 200 rioters here. Enforce a curfew and I seriously doubt the soccer Mom's protesting with their kids in tow, are gonna turn violent.

As for the virus it's effecting everyone directly or indirectly. It cannot be contained, it can be controlled by a basic means called ""herd immunity"". Survive the first infection your body will produce the antibodies and t cells to fight off reinfections. 
A vaccine by the gates foundation I wouldn't trust. Although a vaccine would be the best way to build herd immunity.

For my honest opinion of Bernie Sanders, well okay but it is my opinion and mine alone!

Lazy as the day is long. A first class shister and a second class orator. Never accomplished anything until he got a soapbox to preach a failed system of governance that has exterminated 100's of millions of people in the last 100 years. His whole socialism shtick is the same one Lennon and Stalin used to enslave Russia, just a little more polished in it's presentation. His wealth was garnered by using loopholes in election funding to line his own pockets.
I've never seen a veterans for Bernie slogan in any of his presidential races!
His polocy that the workers should share the profits of a business is a communist manifesto. It didn't work in the USSR and it won't work here.
EOE s (employee owned enterprise) not only due you share profits you also share liabilities and operating expenses. and are completely different than what Bernie preaches.

Sure slap their wrist tell them no it will still happen. Make it right? Nope. If everything could be solved as easy as you make it sound we‚Äôd have a perfect world. Teachers say don‚Äôt cheat on test you think people 100% of people follow instructions? Or do you think some will diverge and cheat?

If every state outlawed guns, the Mexican drug cartels would transport them across the border and sell them here like they do drugs. There are probably over one million gun laws if you include federal, state and local laws.  That is what these gun grabbers can‚Äôt wrap there head around. Criminals by definition do not respect laws!  If you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns.

I hear about spousal abuse all the time and yet there is no call for making marriage or co-habitation illegal! Why are you painting all PD with the same brush and not all parents partners or spouses, what is the difference?  We treat each case as individuals not as a group.  Now here is another question, the cop in Minneapolis had I believe like 14 or 15 citizen complaints against him.  Why was he still on the force!

Yet when someone breaks into their house at 3 in the morning, what do they do? They call someone with a gun to come help them, and pray to God that they get there in time. And if you want to know someone that successfully used a gun to stop someone from entering their house, my mother. Used her .22 to prevent a very stupid boyfriend from entering our house. Of course I'll not give you the time, location, or her name, but just accept the fact that contrary to liberal media bias propaganda, the majority of people that use guns to defend their house do so successfully. You wouldn't even need examples if you look at an information source other than Reddit and CNN. Checkout Fox News perhaps once a week, and you'll see that there are many successful home defenses."

https://www.thecut.com/2020/06/what-does-defund-the-police-mean-the-phrase-explained.html"
5073,hxzsri,"You're straw manning the premise of defunding the police (and distracting from the topic). Sure, people are suggesting that some of the money be used to bolster up the community. It'scertainly part of the conversation.  But it's not the main thesis. What people are suggesting when they say ""defund the police"" is to dial back the breadth of duties police are responsible for, and use other agencies to handle tasks that an undertrained armed police office has no business being responsible for. This would help everybody because we'll less-overworked officers focusing on fewer duties, which will be those that are actually relevant to their very narrow skillset. This would reduce the expenses necessary to run our police departments, and that money can be used to hire/train different sets of professionals that can specialis the tasks and duty we remove from the docket of police. [ Here is a decent overview of what is actually being asked for. ]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ay3tsUjTkyw ) 

And yes, those things would make a lot of crime disappear, because crime inordinately stems out of poverty and desperation (caused by poverty).

As for the drugs, the war on drugs was a farce and a failure, and many of the president's and/or staffers of the Nixon, Reagan, and Clinton campaigns have either admitted it was a mistake and ineffective, or admitted the racial motivations underlining it's inception. We instantly created hundreds of thousands of African American criminals by criminalizing specific drugs favored in those communities, and disproportionately punishing them compared to drugs favored by middle class white folk. (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n7Rm3tuMFTI) At any rate, it is in an inc ok incontrovertible fact that if you decriminalize drug use, you will have less crime...because...the people using drugs will no longer be criminals. That's how the decriminalization of a thing works. It automatically means to do the thing is no longer a criminal act. I don't really have to explain this to you, do I?"
5074,hxzsri,"Why would you call it ""defund the police""?"
5075,hxzsri,"Thing with arms races is that it works the other way too. A dutch burglar could get a gun if he wanted to, it wouldn't be that dificult depending on his criminal network, but he doesn't need one because he's not gonna meet anyone with a gun either. 

Also if what you said about home made bombs was really true we'd see a lot more mass killings with pipe bombs."

Why?"
5077,hxzsri,You're not addressing my point.
5078,hxzsri,"Ok let me rephrase: in the netherlands you don't need a gun because you have the police. Unless you're a drug dealer.

5089,hxzsri,THANK YOU GOOD LORD ITS GOOD TO KNOW SOMEONE AGREES
5090,hxzsri,"Just a few questions and comments about this. Child abuse: we have government agencies who‚Äôs whole charge is address issues of child abuse and neglect as well as a bunch of other services from other agencies for families and parents to change and improve their behavior. In some cases parents/guardians are arrested and/or unable to reclaim their child. The same is true for domestic abuse, we have services in our society to help victims and address abusers and in some cases those people are jailed. 

What I don‚Äôt see is the same robust services for police who behave poorly, or for victims of police who behave poorly. So your examples don‚Äôt exactly work the way you think they work. 

Also, Democrat run cities... the 50 largest cities, 35 have Dem mayors and 13 have Republican mayors. And all of those republican cities have populations of 1.5 million or under. There just more Dem cities and those cities are in some cases multitudes more populated than Republican led cities. Also this whole point is sorta dumb since each city as elected officials of both parties and are often also in mixed states as well. It seems disingenuous to claim that a whole city is one way or the other because of who the mayor is."
5091,hxzsri,"Yes, that could work in theory. But what does NOT work is ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need guns because the police will protect you‚Äù AND ‚Äúdefund the police they won‚Äôt protect you‚Äù"

5096,hxzsri,"First off. That‚Äôs not a bill. It‚Äôs a media story. Until there is a signed bill, it‚Äôs just a theory

Second, yes. Less police, cutting a budget means cutting jobs. Putting more into the community as preventative programs. That‚Äôs idealism, not realism. Problem is...well...spend some time reading police reports and who these guys bust. Less of that? Hehehe.

Second, what social worker is going to want to travel to some of the high crime neighborhoods when their pay is so low?

Where is the crime now?

It is already in neighborhoods where people are mostly raking in a LOT of welfare.  Food stamps, public housing, medicaid...

And still a shit ton of crime."
5099,hxzsri,You're using too many words and linking to articles with more words.
5100,hxzsri,"I will admit that was a logical and well presented argument. Allow me to respond: 

I have no issue with using some of the money to fund whatever program they want to fund, but remember Cops cannot be in two places at the same time.  I‚Äôam also wary of sending these non-police personnel to respond to calls when we both know in a large majority of cases a cop will still be present.   For example do you think that group is going to respond to a call for spousal or child abuse or a person with mental or addiction issues without a police accompanying them? So what have you solved?  Nothing the same cop who would have been there is still there except there are now less of them to patrol and be pro-active in other parts of the city. I may not know a lot, but less cops on the street means more crime.  Write it down, and look at the statistics 6 months after any of these cities go through with the cuts. I am willing to listen to what you think is a situation where police presence of some kind will not be required!  You want to improve training for police officers?  Fine by me!  What has taken all these cities so long to start doing that?  

The response is so overblown by the reality of what is happening it is mind boggling.  Police and citizens interact about 475,000,000 time per year. What percentage results in an incident similar to what happened in the Floyd case?  Here is a fact:  in all of 2019 9 unarmed black suspects were killed by police.  Of those 9, 4 were deemed justified the other 5 are under investigation, in trial phase or resulted in conviction. Based on those numbers we are talking 0.00000002% that it happens. Yes one is one too many but the reaction!  That is the % people are reacting to!  Mean time in Chicago alone, 421 people predominantly black have been killed as of July 25!  Where is the outrage and calls to stop the massacre!  Where is the call to defund worthless programs to hire non-police personnel to stem the bloodletting?  

As for the war on drugs, maybe we should have legalized marijuana earlier. We will find out the consequences of doing this say 15-20 years form now hindsight is always perfect. As to drug crimes penalizing some over others, that is a talking point already debunked.  Yes crack and meth both carry the same penalty!  Meth is almost exclusively a white drug.  Regular coke carries the same penalty across the board.  Is there uneven application of laws?  Maybe but you cannot paint and entire group with the same brush.   
You have to look at each judge and make the call on actual not anecdotal evidence.  If you have it, provide it.  We do not know the entire picture unless you have all the facts. If a black person is up for the third time on a drug charge and a white first time, I would expect penalties to be different as I would expect it if the roles
were reversed.  Recreational use of MJ might have little impact but that certainly does not apply to hard drugs.  I certainly hope you are not for the legalization of coke, heroin, meth and other similar drugs. The wreckage those leave are clearly visible in the homeless population across the US."

I don‚Äôt see that changing anytime soon no matter what they do.  But that was not my point!  The incidents of cop mis-behavior is infinitely less than child or spousal abuse and yet the same reaction is not taking place, why?  Why is the outrage over a bad cop not the same?  You don‚Äôt think there is political motive involved?  

As to police who behave badly!  Who is responsible for keeping the PD accountable.  Well the first level is the Police Chief chosen for and approved by The City Council and the Mayor!  Then the mayor who the Chief reports to then the City Council who is suppose to be a check on the mayor and ultimately the voters who elect the Council and Mayor!  So I ask you again, this cop had 14-15 complaints why was he still on the force?  Where was the Chief, Mayor and City Council?  But you tell me, why is there no support for the families of folks abused by cops?  Could it be that the actual number is so low that it makes no financial sense for a city to pay and maintain a staff to handle this?  Is there something I am not aware of that has kept cities from setting up these groups or panels? 

Democrat run cities!  That dog won‚Äôt hunt.  Be it a city of 100,000 or 8 million the responsibility for the police is the same.  Let‚Äôs take Minneapolis as an example: last Republican Mayor was in 1976 could not find a specific time but I figure the council is about the same, but let‚Äôs use 1985 as last time Republicans had a majority.  That is 35 years ago!  Why were reforms not put in place in 35 years to weed out bad cops?  Why after 35 years is there no support for families hurt by bad cops?   The last incidents I can recall LA, Ferguson, New York, Baltimore and Minneapolis. Only NY with Guliani and Bloomberg a candidate for POTUS as a Democrat can be argued have any Republican influence.  So why?  After decades of Democrat control does this shit happen?  Incompetence, stupidity or they really don‚Äôt give a shit?  You tell me!  

You are pointing at the symptom not the disease. You also dodged my questions.  But here are three I hope you will answer: 

1.  Poor people vote Democrat rich people vote Republican or so the story goes!  So Republicans want to keep people poor so they will vote for Democrats!  Explain this?  

2.  We have 2 political parties.   Which one needs a reliable voting bloc that delivers 95+% every election to have any chance of winning a national election?  

3.  Why are the promises democrats making in 2020 to blacks the same as those from 1970?"

5124,hxzsri,"As I indicated in my very first comment, which you had to have read to have gotten this far, that the ""Defund the Police"" movement is not about eliminating all law enforcement (sure, some people may be saying that, but those people do not represent the majority or embody the benefits of reforming our police system). It's about have fewer (better trained) officers to do the things that we need officers to actually do i.e. investigate crimes, respond to violent criminals/domestic violence, etc. No Pre-Crime needed because we'd still have a police force.

Well, we would have to pay them more, wouldn't we? With some of that money deducted from our bloated police budget. 

As for the final comment, there will of course be people who never give up drugs. But a system that treats drug addiction as a criminal act rather than a sickness is broken system. Incarceration is not how we should be treating these people."
5125,hxzsri,"You're using a meme as your source?

Anyway, you summed up all of ""defund the police"" into ""give people free shit"". I'm not going to say that no one is saying we can find free healthcare or whatever with that money (we probably can't), but the vast majority of the debate I have seen has revolved around what other well-trained professionals we can hire that specialize in the duties that the police already sort of do, just not very well. Things that we do not need an armed, poorly trained police officer to do. Not giving people ""free shit"".

Yes, because those things dont bring people out of poverty. And with the poverty, comes the crime, and with the crime comes over policing, jail time, loss of jobs (you usually dont get to keep your job after being gone for months or years) and economic independence, stricter laws and harsher punishments, repeatedly offenses, on and on, bringing the entire community down."

I don‚Äôt think we should expect to send anyone to prison and for them to go down a better path afterwards, although it does happen. I do agree that there are scary bad eggs out there. But where is the line drawn between a hopeless criminal and one who could again become a helpful member of society? And are we really doing enough to make our communities safe, supportive, and inclusive enough to prevent crime in the first place? And is the current model of policing helping any of this?

Prison system, I have customers who work as seniors. The problem is, new kids at the systems get bribed by criminals in jail for cigarettes to guns (which they confiscate numerous times in jail).

There are plenty of scenarios, such as mental health calls, that could be handled by professionals with different skillsets than police officers and those people needn't be armed.

I'm not sure why that was what it got compressed to, but it likely wasn't the product of the consensus agreement or calculated decision. It's just the most controversial phrasing of the concept, which further spread the phrase, as it drummed up more virulent opposition, which gained more media attention and turned into it's own movement. However it came about, I do think the phrase does a lot of damage in obfuscating what is really a rather innocuous concept.

There would be money for more training if we had smaller, more concentrated departments. That's kind of beside the point though. [We already spend an enormous amount on our police departments.](https://populardemocracy.org/news-and-publications/congress-must-divest-billion-dollar-police-budget-and-invest-public-education) (This does not even include expenses for the mass incarcerations in the U.S., which is usually not much smaller than the costs of maintaining the police departments themselves.) Why is this the only route worth spending that money on? Why is funding the bloated budgets required for police departments preferable to spending that same money in other ways that directly benefit the community, and reduce rates of recidivism, reduced prosecutions, and reduced incarcerations - yet you're simultaneously not interested in better training police officers? [The budgets for police departments goes up and up, even though the crime has been going down for decades.](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2020/police-budget-spending-george-floyd-defund/) If we can move the system away from being based on punitive measures and towards one orientated around preventative care, we can improve on the reduced crime crime we've enjoyed since the 1994  Violent Crime and Law Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but without the mass incarceration, over-sized police force, and disproportionate policing/prosecution/incarceration of black communities."
5154,hxzsri,"The fact that it could be worse should not discourage us from trying to make it better. It is poor logic that to think otherwise that justifies inaction. Not to mention, our progress trickles out to the rest of the world. We all benefit.

You can certainly argue that part of this was a dispatching issue and might have have occurred even if there were dedicated people for this kind of scenario. My pushback on this would be:

* A situation like this falls into an awkward middleground where paramedics aren't quite the appropriate responders (respondents?) but neither are the police. The risk of escalation or use of force will increase along with the number of armed responders.
* If there were dedicated personnel for this category of situation -- or other categories that might not specifically require an armed police response -- a dispatcher would/should know that and could assign units appropriately.

Even if we did replace some percentage of police with other categories of personnel (i.e. defund the police), that's not to say that police would necessarily be excluded from calls. You could easily decide that instead of sending 4 officers, you'll send 2 officers and 2 mental health ""officers"", or whatever."

CONCLUSIONS
In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death. Randomized, controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 are needed. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)"
5268,i0ku01,"Ahhh, so you found 1 study that says it‚Äôs effective. The point of a study is that the results should be easily recreated."
5269,i0ku01,This drug has been approved for 50+ years. The end!
5270,i0ku01,"Not trying to be confrontational or anything, just trying to have a discussion. I did read your comment, and I'm trying to to make the point that a single stand-out study with poor controls does not mitigate several other well designed studies. Notably, the study you reference was poorly randomized, and patients who received HCQ also received steroids which have a proven mortality benefit in COVID.

Taking a medication like HCQ as a prophylaxis is really not practical and potentially harmful. However, the bottom line is that almost all of the evidence thus far shows that it is not an  effective treatment or preventative. 

If this medication wasnt so politically charged it would have been forgotten as a dead end for treating COVID weeks ago. I agree that it's irresponsible to recommend it, but that's because the evidence we have currently tells us that it provides no benefit."
5271,i0ku01,"So the absolute difference was -2.4%, however you'll notice that the 95% confidence interval passes through zero, p=0.35. this indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the two results.

Usually studies are stopped if there is either lack of an effect or evidence of a potential risk to participants. Here's another article from JAMA that provides more information.

I have never found an ounce of sense in right wing ideas, someone please attempt to show me why they are good.

I'll make a list of topics with a brief view point:



American insurance
----I have personal experience working and dealing with insurance companies, they actively lobby and push to rip off Americans. IMO there needs to be a good public option, healthcare should not prioritize money or shareholders.



Privitisation 
---- I've spoken to many right wingers that say the free market is the best for everything, they say it promotes ingenuity. I agree for alot of feilds, however its main goal is profit and in areas where the goal is the enrichment of society (school, healthcare, transportation) I have only seen negatives.



Abortion
---- non-issue.



Immigration 
---- historically a scape goat for internal problems and is no different today, non-issue.



Wealth inequality
---- rich people compound wealth generationally and create higher barriers of entry to lucrative feilds perpetuating a pooling of wealth towards a smaller and smaller group. Wealth is a product of you and your society, some people deserve wealth more than others but if someones wealth puts them into a position that compromises others rights it's an issue to me.



Environment
---- earth is big flask, change the form of dormant chemicals and swirl them around at an industrial level you will get dramatic changes that compound. Climate change denial is a huge reason why I have trouble understanding conservative view points.

5486,isz7e8,"So I actually want to have a legit discussion here. Have you seen the recent numbers/graphs regarding covid cases and covid deaths around the world and in all the other industrialized western countries? How does the US have the worst covid response?


The US is still only 9th in the world in deaths per million, which is pretty crazy considering all the cases we‚Äôve had. The US currently has less deaths per million than countries like Spain and UK, and we just recently passed Italy. 

South America is just being ravaged by it right now, especially Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Brazil. Peru has the highest deaths per million total in the world, and Argentina is currently having more daily new cases per million than the US ever had. All of those countries are seeing steep increases in daily new cases. 

France, Spain, UK, Italy, and Germany are all seeing a pretty steep rise in cases as they‚Äôve begun to reopen. Especially Spain and France. France‚Äôs current spike is far larger than their initial spike in March/April. 

Israel is also being ravaged by the virus. Israel just had 4764 new cases yesterday. Per capita, that is more than 2.5x the worst single day the US has had. 

And then you have India. My lord, if you look at India‚Äôs chart for daily new cases, it literally looks like the quintessential exponential growth chart. They are going to have by far the highest number of cases and deaths soon and will be in a much much worse position than the US ever way. But that is to be expected of a country the size of India. 

And then we all know that it‚Äôs pretty evident that China has by far the most deaths and cases, they are just obviously lying about their numbers. You trying to tell me the entire country of China, with 1.5 billion people, has fewer cases and fewer deaths than the state of Massachusetts? When the virus literally began in wuhan, China, an extremely impoverished city of over 11 million people? That one city has 11 million people, that‚Äôs more than the entire state of Massachusetts, and people in Mass have a much higher quality of life than people in Wuhan. There is absolutely no way that country only has 80k cases. Also, China was literally executing/imprisoning anyone who tried to speak out about the virus, which prevented the rest of the world from knowing about it for months. Hard to say that the US, or anyone really, has had a worse response to covid than China. 

Everyone harps on how terrible the US has been in regards to covid, but they are seeing a pretty decent sized reduction in daily new cases. The US was averaging 70k new cases a day a couple months ago, they are now down to 35k, whereas all the countries above are seeing steep increases. The US just got hit early on and therefore saw an earlier spike than the rest of the world. It‚Äôs like what we are seeing with the northeast US and the Midwest US. The northeast got hit early on, and because of that aren‚Äôt seeing many new cases, whereas the Midwest is just now starting to get hit bad which is why they are seeing a bunch of new cases. The difference between the US and the other countries that got hit early on was that those countries went into complete lockdown whereas the US only went into temporary lockdowns and then switched to partial lockdowns. However, now that those other countries have started to reopen, they are all seeing a sharp increase in cases, whereas the US has seen a steady decline for the past 2 months. Eventually, every country is going to get hit by this thing, the US just got hit earlier than most everyone else, which is why their numbers look worse at the moment. Give it a few months when the rest of the world starts to get hit bad and the US‚Äôs numbers per capita will not be looking that bad compared to the rest of the world. 

Everyone keeps saying ‚Äúoh the US has the most cases and deaths in the entire world!‚Äù Well guess what? The US has the third largest population in the world. The only two countries with a higher population are China and India, and I‚Äôve already addressed those two above. The US also had a much deeper seeding of the virus than most of the other countries due to the frequent travel between the US and China and between the US and Europe. By the time everyone starting realizing what covid was, there were already thousands of undetected covid cases in the country. It is way harder to contain thousands of covid cases in a country of 330 million people than it is to contain 25 covid cases in a country of 5 million (New Zealand). You just can‚Äôt compare the US to other countries like New Zealand, Norway, Finland, and Denmark, because those countries combined have 10% of the population of the US. Like I said, it is much easier to prevent the spread of a virus in a small country than it is in a country of 330 million people that spans literally an entire continent. 

The virus only goes away by one of two ways, either there is a vaccine, or the community reaches herd immunity. You can‚Äôt count on a vaccine because there are plenty of viruses that have no vaccine for them even after decades of research. Even if a vaccine is developed, it would take months if not years to distribute it to everyone. With regards to herd immunity, it looks like it is much easier to reach herd immunity with covid than it is with other diseases/viruses. There is not a single community that has gotten hit hard more than once. Once a local region gets hit hard, it has a ton of cases, and then it doesn‚Äôt really see any new cases. We are seeing this in NYC, New Jersey, Florida, Texas, Chicago, Phoenix, northern Italy, Madrid, etc. So it really seems at this point, the only thing you can do is protect the vulnerable as best as you can, and let the virus run it‚Äôs course through the community."

5579,isz7e8,"So legit question, not trying to get into a shouting match here. What would joe Biden have done at the beginning of the pandemic that would be considered ‚Äúdoing something about the pandemic?‚Äù We know he would not have cut off travel from China or Europe because he said that was racist/bigoted when trump did it. He claims he would institute a nationwide mandatory mask mandate, but that would be unconstitutional. 

I‚Äôm not saying that Trump handled the pandemic perfectly, but the reality of the matter is no one would‚Äôve handled this pandemic particularly well considering no one knew anything about the virus at the beginning."
5580,isz7e8,"Reversed progress? Exactly how? And there is no evidence that the police gassed protesters so that Trump could take photos at the church. In fact, if I remember correctly, the police were trying to enforce a perimeter. And if it remember correctly, the protesters were also throwing things at the police as well. And what would Biden do that Trump didn‚Äôt do. Biden opposed the travel ban, he was throwing rallies all throughout March, when trump and the CDC were busy trying to create tests, get ventilators built, and build hospitals in New York. Hospitals which went virtually unused while Cuomo sent covid positive nursing home patients back into the nursing homes. New Jersey as well. There is a reason those two states have the highest death count in the country. And don‚Äôt say Trump called the virus a hoax. He didn‚Äôt, go look at the footage. He was calling the democrat politicization of the virus a hoax. ‚ÄúOne of my people came up to me and said ‚ÄúMr. President, they tried to beat you on ‚ÄòRussia, Russia, Russia‚Äô. That didn‚Äôt work out too well. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation.

Here's some advice, if your state is a shithole and REFUSES federal aid, write to your Governor. If your city sucks, write your Mayor. Protest PEACEFULLY, and let them know that your not willing to suffer just because THEY hate the president.  Your just a normal American that wants peace and prosperity for people in your state.

They still don't go away so you underfund their cities and the lead pipes and toxic water still don't kill em so you get cops to do it, but that still doesn't work...

Prisons are already federal programs, there are also state ones and private ones.  

Private prisons do not determine who goes to jail and for how long, therefore they aren't to blame for prison populations.  Honestly, I like people going to jail for a long time, it means crappy humans are NOT in society.  

>health care should be federal programs so that the point of the programs is not money but to help people

Oh you mean like the VA where my ex-girlfriend in Phoenix gave the nurse the waiting list so she could whistle blow that government ran healthcare was letting people die and the law makes it almost impossible to sue?  That government ran healthcare?  

You know the VA sucked until 2017 when Trump by executive order required that if the VA doesn't see you within 30 days, you get to go to a private provider and the government pays.

You do realize that the US has the highest cancer survival rates in the world.  

https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/cancer-survival-rates-by-country

Yup, we beat everyone, including Canada, UK, Sweden, even Germany except in Stomach Cancer.

Now you might say, but it costs so much.  Well, there are a number of reasons for it.  One thing is that the US leads the world in healthcare innovation.  We literally discover virtually all the medication and procedures that the world uses to save lives.

https://arcdigital.media/u-s-health-care-reality-check-1-pharmaceutical-innovation-574241fb80ba

Many countries do not accept our patents on medicine, which means the US citizen is stuck paying for the entire R&D bill.  Trump is trying to fix that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_research_and_development_spending

While that link isn't solely healthcare research, it does illustrate that the US spends the most on research, but for some reason you want to tax the rich more so companies won't have as much to put into research and let the government do it, the same government that studies sexual habits of shrimps, can't develop an health insurance site, and can't build a cell phone and when they did it failed miserably.

>If we don‚Äôt meet in the middle America will tear itself apart. Unless death and violence is your goal

That is hyperbole or an ad hominem, but I'll take it as the former.

You know I don't know why you have Stage 1 thinking.  For example, you act like this is a socialized/nationalized medicine or the status quo.  I don't argue that.

There are real steps we can take that will remove the government and will keep safety the same and yet lower prices.  This article lists two:

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-can-slash-health-care-costs-75-with-2-fundamental-changes-and-without-medicare-for-all-2019-08-15

I can personally think of 4-5 more things that will lower costs and improve outcomes/access.

>Edit: also do not base your entire argument on second hand examples. If you want to have a discussion give me information I can verify and I will do the same.

I have sourced more than you have and you quoted a google search with just raw numbers and no context with regards to percentages.  1% paying the same as 90% doesn't lend the same same context as saying 1% pays nearly 50% of all federal taxes and the top 10% pays nearly 90% of all federal taxes and the top 50% pays 97% of all taxes.  This isn't even addressing the poor that get back more than they pay in taxes through the EITC.

The 1776 view is that America was founded on timeless principles of self governance and inalienable Rights given to the individual, that built upon thousands of years of philosophy as a contrast to the racial foundings of most countries; America is a creedal nation, not an ethnic one.

 ‚Ä¢ In the three months leading up to election day, more than [85,000 voters](https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/georgia-cancels-fewer-voter-registrations-after-surge-last-year/fqT1bcSzGu33UEpTMDzMVK/) were purged from rolls under Kemp.

 Of those 2017 numbers, investigative reporter Greg Palast told [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2018/10/07/a-journalist-just-created-a-website-for-georgia-voters-to-learn-if-theyve-been-purged/),  200,000 people left the state, died or moved out their district, making  them legitimate cancellations.

 Furthermore from 2012 to 2016, [1.5 million voters were purged](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Purges_Growing_Threat_2018.1.pdf)  ‚Äì more than 10% of all voters ‚Äì from records, according to a 2018  report from the Brennan Center for Justice.

It's completely understandable how people don't know about this stuff. They don't tell you about it in school, and plenty of folks don't want to admit hugely uncomfortable truths about their country. We don't do it because we ""hate"" it, we just want to see it best for everyone. You're only as free as your most oppressed chain in my eyes.

They have 7 years or they have to re-register. That's there law based on their state. Again what does this have to do with suppression? I fail to see the comparison you are trying to make. If they have an issue with it anything, if some of these people never have to re-register that's something they can take up with their legislative process and talk to the dumb-asses that they voted(or in their cases didn't vote in) for whomever runs that circus.  

""Peterman re-registered soon afterward, and he cast a ballot in the 2018 election for governor.""  Well shit, would you look at that! He re-registered and voted!

Alright my fav, NYtimes source. Liberal hogwash at it's finest. ""accusations of voter suppression"", once again accusations and whole lot of finger pointing and the house committee who was involved  came up with a whole lot of nothing and did a whole lot of nothing.

It's the fact that Peterman HAD to re register, at all, regardless of outcome. Think of all the ones that DIDNT end up re registering, for a number of reasons. It took a single extra step of critical thought but I somehow managed to do it, see, that wasn't hard.

340,134 wrongfully purged. If it stands to needlessly make your right to vote harder and not feasible for working people, it's a voter suppression tactic. Long lines and removing polling locations is one way. Outright removing their voter status is another.


""And nearly 56,000 of them re-registered within the same county, according to the AJC/APM Reports analysis. If their registrations hadn‚Äôt been canceled, they would have been able to vote without having to re-register.

ONE black president somehow voids the literal mounds of evidence that I suggested you look at that happened before and continue after Obama's presidency???? He was a charismatic, light skinned neo liberal, that played a big part of it too. 

Is racism gone because a minority of black people can become rich and famous athletes? Is poverty over because one black man was able to rise to CEO?

Black Overrepresentation in prison population, significant disparities in income, wealth, economic mobility, access to higher quality education and healthcare, that all just vanished right because we elected a neo liberal president right?

Not to mention casual racism started to rear its ugly head again during his era. Plenty of republicans pulled out nooses and Osama caricatures, I never forget those. lack of funding, no community support, cops ready to nail you on every corner, school to prison pipeline and a horrendously callous justice system gets some otherwise non violent offenders behind bars, high recidivism keeps them there and perpetuates the cycle.

His economic policy clearly at least allowed a steady trend of black and white males back to work and then when trump took over, he continued that trend and brought unemployment to close to lows we haven‚Äôt seen since 2000 (and 1970 before that). 

Then corona happened and now unemployment is at record highs.. but hopefully with this sharp increase we can see a sharp decrease because we really haven‚Äôt seen how an economy recovers in recent times from a pandemic, especially with how many people will hopefully be returning to work"

As the unemployment rate gets lower, you‚Äôre dipping more and more into that ‚Äúunemployable‚Äù population. That‚Äôs why when unemployment this higher, it‚Äôs not impressive to drop it by one percentage point because a lot of those people are actively looking for work.

Think of it like dumping out a full can of tomato sauce (what‚Äôs in the can is unemployed, being emptied out of the can is people getting jobs). You can dump almost all of it out pretty easily, but there will always be some stubborn bits that won‚Äôt come out no matter how hard you shake the can. That‚Äôs what 4 or 5% unemployment is, basically. Hope that helps :)"

Planned Parenthood was formerly called The Negro Project, founded by racist Democrat Margaret Sanger for the purpose of black genocide. She thought blacks were inferior and wanted them eliminated. Planned Parenthood clinics are located in black neighborhoods.  They changed the name from The Negro Project to make them sound less sinister. They killed more black babies last year in NYC than were born.

""Trump's order did not fully ""close"" the U.S. off to China, as he asserts. It temporarily barred entry by foreign nationals who had traveled in China within the previous 14 days, with exceptions for the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Americans returning from China were allowed back after enhanced screening at select ports of entry and for 14 days afterward. But U.S. scientists say screenings can miss people who don't yet show symptoms of COVID-19; while symptoms often appear within five or six days of exposure, the incubation period is 14 days.""

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ghetto

https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/catosletterv9n1.pdf

Do you have a source for poverty being directly created by welfare? As I understand it people in poverty turn to welfare for support. I‚Äôve never heard of a single person willingly quitting their job to live on welfare. 

You might be using ghetto to refer to an area where a lot of poor people live. Yes, in every country in the world there are almost certainly areas where poor people congregate, however most (as in the vast majority) welfare is available on the basis of income, wealth, disability and number of dependents, not geography. The reason they congregate in those areas is because those are often the only places they can afford to live."

5832,gzqhfo,"That's exactly how we look at population statistics though, in all fields. 

If things are ""fair"", when you take a subset of the population with X condition, then the demographics of that subset should match the demographics of the population as a whole.

This is why we say women are underrepresented in say, computer science, which is \~15% women iirc. The general population is 50% women, so we expect the population of women in computer science should be 50% if everything was fair and equal. 

This is also why we say black americans are underrepresented in STEM fields. If everything was ""fair and equal"" then there should be 13% black representation in STEM. 

Thus, when talking about welfare recipients, if everything is fair and equal, we should expect to see 13% of welfare recipients as black. It's 22%, thus by the same procedures in every other population study, whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the population subset that is ""welfare recipients""."

""States can't get ppe""- I will concede on that point. Acquisition of supplies should have been a federal effort to avoid state competition. But it also doesn't help when two shiploads of ppe from China were confiscated and returned to Port.

5888,gzqhfo,"See, these numbers ARE trash.  The workforce increased by more than 20 million under Obama.  His ""jobs added"" numbers didn't even keep up with population growth.  That is why you cannot look at un-normalized numbers...hence, why we have the unemployment RATE.

Median income increased under Obama, but not by much.  in 2017 is was $58,811  it consistently went down until 2015 where it landed an a measly increase ending in an administration maximum of  $61,779.  Out of 8 years in office, Obama's median income was below his first year 6 of them.  


However, obama was handed an economy with a median income of $60, 985 (GWBs last year)  So Obama was actually responsible for a wimpy increase of 1.13%

So far, Trump's median income was  $63030 for 2019.  That is a 1.2% increase over Obama's best year.  BTW, this is a FAR better than Obama's 3rd year number...which was negative.

But the real improvement over Obama's numbers is the black median income. Blacks were hit harder under Obama's administration and never really returned to his first-year incomes until Trump took office.  Black median income is growing faster under Trump than any other demographic.

And finally....Trump's approval numbers are about the same as Obama's....but neither had an approval rating over 50% for any significant time.

I recommend that you learn to find these numbers yourself so you don't look so uninformed on the Internet."

I‚Äôm not sure how being privileged means I dont see the real issue here.  I‚Äôm saying I dont have any evidence that welfare ‚Äúcreated‚Äù ghettos, or that welfare sustains them, the fact that there is a high percentage of people in ghettos who require some form of public assistance doesnt prove that ghettos were created by that welfare. My argument is that the creation of ghettos in the United States was a complicated process, first begun by redlining and housing discrimination which was later made worse by the drug war and deindustrialization.  Your argument is that welfare created ghettos, if I am understating correctly because welfare disincentivizes people from working.  Either I am missing something your this is a non-sequitur."

6004,idhlhr,"It all seems prerecorded or edited in. On the second day of the DNC, When his family arrived at the end with balloons, it seemed like he was standing in front of green screen. I wonder how the debates are going to work."
6005,idhlhr,"Yeah I was confused at first, too. Almost looked like an Antifa ad that got hacked or something."
6006,idhlhr,I think that's the point but who knows in this world now.
6007,idhlhr,"Most liberals do not support Antifa so clearly it‚Äôs a joke and an effective one
Yeah"
6008,idhlhr,"At least, until November 3rd"
6009,idhlhr,Also...social distancing.
6010,idhlhr,The message is that supporting Biden is supporting Antifa.
6011,idhlhr,"I think a lot of antifa couldn't care less really. At the very least some are funded by Soros. A group of them was recorded them shouting Soros where is our money? Biden may not be their optimal candidate but anything and I mean anything that can give them more power they will be happy with. Obviously the democrats are ok with a shit tier candidate because they are THAT desperate. Biden will only be their puppet. Just like Kamala who is notorious on flip flopping, contradicting herself on many points. It's all for the interests of the deep state."
6012,idhlhr,I can support terrorists and they‚Äôll still call me an infidel.
6013,idhlhr,It‚Äôs called humour

6018,idhlhr,"So you left Republican party because someone act ""childish""? What about ideology?"
6019,idhlhr,Where did you go?  If you‚Äôre looking for the high road it couldn‚Äôt have been the Dems right?
6020,idhlhr,Yeah. Republicans are held to a much higher standard. Maybe we should dye our hair purple and throw tantrums in the intersection to earn you back. LOL.
6021,idhlhr,There is just so much to choose from!
6022,idhlhr,Bbbbbut Obama.... fuck off traitor.
6023,idhlhr,"It‚Äôs just payback for reopening Hillary‚Äôs investigation two weeks before the election, asking Russia to interfere in the election, and then winning it by a thin margin even after losing the popular vote by 3 million. Talk about dirty tricks..."
6024,idhlhr,"He may be hurting himself, but we can still help get the word out."
6025,idhlhr,"Please don‚Äôt say that publicly. For your own sake, just never repeat what you just said."

6040,idhlhr,"Okay, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thought that. It looked odd."
6041,idhlhr,"Joe will get all of the questions and answers ahead of time and read off of a teleprompter.  They did this for Hillary but got caught, this time they will be much more careful and cover their ass this time"

6044,idhlhr,Didn‚Äôt stop him from going to the George Floyd funeral.
6045,idhlhr,Sure I get that but it‚Äôs still wrong. What has Biden said or his platform suggested that shows support for Antifa?
6046,idhlhr,It‚Äôs amazing how the DNC can‚Äôt get a good candidate. The only conclusion I‚Äôve come to is they are just way out of touch with their supporters. They are running a character campaign and nothing more. I would hope that most voters are smart enough to consider candidate policy and record as well as character. Although politics now seems to me a mash up of TMZ and the Jerry Springer show. I‚Äôm just waiting for Pelosi to start throwing crumpled up papers at people.
6047,idhlhr,Two empty vessels on the dem ticket is a dream come true for the dnc.
6048,idhlhr,Do you have any evidence that Soros is funding antifa?
6049,idhlhr,"This is just absolute conspiracy tier garbage.
Soros runs ANTIFA. Lol.

Who does he send the cheques to? They aren't even an actual group. It's just a politicial stance."
6050,idhlhr,What's the joke?
6051,idhlhr,I think I missed the part where the driver was asking to see a manager.
6052,idhlhr,"I don't see it there anymore. All I see is the selfish old world cashing in ideology to win at all costs. I was embarrassed to be a Republican, though I do have many conservative values."

6054,idhlhr,‚ÄúEveryone who disagrees with me politically is a traitor‚Äù

6056,idhlhr,"Yes because people from different countries around the world don‚Äôt go on /pol/ and a large majority of the pro trump memes don‚Äôt come from that board. Sure.

Why would I tell anyone in public I go on 4chan? I look normal."

6058,idhlhr,What difference does it make anyway.
6059,idhlhr,The formal acceptance is this late? Why?
6060,idhlhr,I am the caucus
6061,idhlhr,That was great.  Imagine the shit he says at home when no press is around
6062,idhlhr,"This is why the Democrats and the media are pushing so hard for there to be no debates.  They know Biden will stick his frail, senile foot in it within seconds of the lights coming up.

Covid is an excuse."
6063,idhlhr,IF there will be debates
6064,idhlhr,"It‚Äôs going to be a good laugh that‚Äôs for sure. He had some cringe worthy moments in the primaries. To be fair Trump has his word fumbles too and these recent arrests aren‚Äôt great (although they don‚Äôt implicate trump). 

Going to good tv that much we know!"

6066,idhlhr,Pence will be destroyed in debate with Harris.

6072,idhlhr,"Silence over this violence... Joe Biden has not had the courage to say one single thing about all of the violent encounters that we‚Äôve seen in multiple cities across the country.

Why? Because it benefits him in his feeble mind..."
6073,idhlhr,"Democrats calling those riots, peaceful protests. Like in Portland and Seattle and Chicago."
6074,idhlhr,"Can you imagine having to vote for someone whose only real attribute is ""hes not the guy he's running against?"""

I really don't think they can win even by massive fraud. Most of the young libs won't vote bc Bernie isnt on the ticket.

Worst slogan ever."
6105,idhlhr,"I hope Trump wins in a landslide victory. I have talked to family members, random people, heard from podcasts all saying that Trump will win in a land slide. I see and hear others saying they have never seen as many patriots out in public (wearing trump apparel, coming out from Democrat to Republican, etc) like anytime in this generation. 

The polls say Trump is behind but I remember very clearly the weeks leading up to the last election how Hillary was up at least a few points up over Trump nearly across the board, if not all. Its all bullshit. Just like much of what is said on MSM and what Joe Biden was reading on his teleprompter accepting his democratic nomination."
6106,idhlhr,"It‚Äôs really not. You can get sound bites and cut video to suit your perspective. That‚Äôs what plays. Is joe a creepy handsy pedophile?  Most likely not, still has a creepy factor though. As do a lot of them."

6108,idhlhr,"The first one, sure.  The second one says *Trump* shouldn‚Äôt debate *Biden*, and the third and fourth definitely show the media is pushing for it but also say that a lot of Democrats, including Biden himself, still want to hold them.  I actually agree with a couple of the suggestions, namely: each candidate should pick one candidate and jointly pick a third and that there should be a live fact-checking stream (on both sides) during the debates, but it looks like most voters on both sides want the debates held and it‚Äôs just certain media personalities calling for them to be canceled."
6109,idhlhr,Lol couldn‚Äôt say it better myself.
6110,idhlhr,"Yessir, im seeing the same thing and so are lots of people that I and my acquaintances know. It's really something to behold. People are seeing the writing on the wall: looters and rioters are burning cities while police have their hands tied while mayors and governors are on tv showing not only lack of support but a complete disdain for what they do. People don't want to worry about their town or suburb being next.

Byron Donalds had his campaign sabatoged in FL and he still won. People are leaving CA, WA, OR, and NY in droves. People are sick of ""woke"" being shoved down their throats. They can't even get away from it at work. BLM rioters have killed 30 people so far an not one single Democrat has condemned it. And now we're getting closer to a vaccine that isn't proving its efficacy in trials, but these dem leaders will still attempt to force it on their people like a carrot dangling from a stick so they can ""safely reopen the cities."" Btw, gates was just on tv saying the vax isn't working with just a single dose and wouldnt give a straight answer to the question about 80% of the people that got a second dose dealt with severe pain as just one of the side effects.

Sorry, I got carried away. My point is that people are getting more and more fed up every day with the bs and hypocrisy that's right in everyones faces. Its not even being hidden anymore. City and state leaders were given emergency powers that have gone to their heads and the people are tired of it."
6111,idhlhr,You telling me to keep my thoughts to myself = telling me to think one way
6112,idhlhr,"I really appreciate what you have to say. Please by all means get carried away. We need more of that especially the stuff you are talking about it. MSM doesnt even cover as much as the world needs to hear, yes even Fox news. 

Im working in California right now. Flew in from Colorado a couple weeks ago. So much work here because of the looting and numerous breakins which my work just so happens to ""benefit"" from. California is all fucked up. I have spoken to handfuls of people the last several months and Ive heard a lot of people sick and tired of the bullshit going on in california thanks to the corrupt democrats."
6113,idhlhr,"That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. You are allowed to think whatever you want. However, I think that what you think is not factual and actually quite stupid, so I‚Äôm suggesting you keep it to yourself because it‚Äôs embarrassing. You can still think whatever you want, I never told you to change your opinion or anything."
6114,idhlhr,"Thanks for the encouragement.

California is still mostly red, it's just a handful of cities that are liberal havens. Luckily there's alot of people in those liberal cities that cant help but to see all of the crooked bullshit going on around them.

On the flip side, there's even more people in those cities that are so far removed from reality that they'll never see beyond their bubble. They'll keep voting in the browns, the newsomes, the pelosi's, and the getty's because theyve been running CA as long as most voters have been alive, and most people vote for a familiar name.

I'd love nothing more than to see CA vote these crooks out and turn their state around. Also, I really hope Chicago is just as fed up and vote mayor beetlejuice out asap. That is one vile cunt that displays her superiority on a daily basis."
6115,idhlhr,If you don‚Äôt think it was /pol/ who made all the pro trump memes in 2016 then dude I have some beach front property in Iowa to sell you
6116,idhlhr,"I was born and raised in Chicago. Recently moved out a couple years ago. That mayor is something else. I grew up in the area of the city where many of the police, fire fighters, paramedics live. One of the only city districts who has had a republican representive for many years straight. 

I sometimes work in those liberal havens in California. San francisco is one of them and it is something else. I was working on a jobsite into the early hours of the morning. About 1-2am I saw what looked like out of a movie. About 15-20 homeless walking like zombies coming out of the fog. The police were doing their rounds moving them. 

Other than that, people there generally speaking are brainwashed. Stuck in their bubble indeed."

6169,ao4pso,"If you were paying attention though, you could CLEARLY see that she was only doing it when those women directly beside her told her to. Either that or she was day dreaming to the max and her piers called her out to stand up. Either way I thought it was comical."
6170,ao4pso,"Yeah, herself."
6171,ao4pso,Terrified? Or do we just loathe her?
6172,ao4pso,I‚Äôm terrified of a system that would promote the likes of her. Not her personally. She‚Äòs become the face of something cancerous in our society. 
6173,ao4pso,Socialists are parasites that need to be stamped out. She/he/it (pick you pronoun)... they all need to go. 
6174,ao4pso,You‚Äôve got it all wrong. She is the Right‚Äôs greatest ally.
6175,ao4pso,"Agreed. I hope she serves the interests of her constituents well and with distinction. I want to see what the ‚ÄúGreen New Deal‚Äù does with interest and concern. That said, I think she has her head in the clouds. "
6176,ao4pso,I think the Tweet implies that she hasn‚Äôt suffered or done anything worthwhile while those people have. It also shows that she doesn‚Äôt have the decency to applaud them. 
6177,ao4pso,"She‚Äôs been a congresswoman for a little over a month, elected in a district she couldn‚Äôt lose. Maybe it‚Äôs her new career, but she‚Äôs got nothing in the way of things accomplished.

6182,ao4pso,The media cares. That‚Äôs why we have to. We have to stop her and make sure the public knows her for what she really is. 
6183,ao4pso,"I wouldn‚Äôt, except that she‚Äôs so radical, and the Democrats are primping her for more power.  She‚Äôs their answer to Trump.  When the pendulum swings so far in one direction, it will swing just as far in the other.  "
6184,ao4pso,"Tell that to the Democrats. She's quite vocal and notorious due to her own party making her notorious first as if she was the great deal. Such pretentiousness will be met with an equivalent reception. In this case, mock."

6199,ao4pso,"Low hanging fruit. She has said some incredibly naive things. She reminds me of some people I knew in college: idealistic but dreadfully naive. Intelligent, but self impression in excess of that intellect. 

However, I am optimistic. She may be in this for the long haul and will learn. Perhaps in a term or so she‚Äôll contribute something beyond some cringed tweets. "
6200,ao4pso,The right loves her so much because she is so out of touch. They use her words to paint the whole party with the same brush.  This will only hurt the Dems in future elections.

6238,ao4pso,"Cortez is an active identitarian who believes personal value and merit comes from your race and sex and that your individual experience is superceded by said person's race, sex, or class. 

She's also the author of The Green New Deal, a plan to overhaul our entire electrical grid to be 100% renewable... This is an unfeasible plan due to inherit problems with renewable energy and how are power grids operated and maintained. It is a pipe dream, and implementing it would be a very expensive and costly mistake. As someone who works in this field, her ideas on how the system works are not congruent with reality. A lot of misconceptions abound in this field by newcomers. Hell, even Google had major financial issues with their Google fiber project because they refused to listen to the company I work for (among others)... So if you are waiting for Google fiber in North Austin TX... it's gonna take a while. 

She is also pushed actively for socialism, and has been a member of the Democratic Socialist Party until she ran as a Democrat. Socialism is evil by stealing money from people who've earned it. She did not suddenly lose those beliefs. She is still a socialist.

She also doesn't understand how our electoral college system works, and why it exists in the first place. She wants to completely remove it... Which would absolve this nation as a whole. If there was no Electoral College this nation would fracture in half.

In short she is a far left ideologue who will bankrupt the United States and push racist and sexist ideology into law. "
6239,ao4pso,"She is a 29 year old socialist who won‚Äôt 18,000 votes in a heavy blue majority minority district to unseat Joe Crawley in a primary.

Proponent of universal, nationalised healthcare provision for all Americans.

6269,ao4pso,"I mostly agree with that but the issue being that if one party controls the media industrial complex as well as the education system and actively surpresses stories that would help their political opposition, then only allowing small donations, the media, and acedemic to influence people would benefit the side that is not pro business/free market economics. It's more than a simple cut and dry thing. Yes having corporations able to spend money and exert influence isn't the ideal at all, but currently their enfluence is used to counterbalance the current media, acedemic, and union power that exists.

In the United States you are more likely to be taught by an open socialist or communist then by someone who is center to center right. Right wing acedemics are almost non-existent. "

6277,ao4pso,"And without taxes how are we to get infrastructure, schools, the military? The Border Wall?

The whole ‚Äútaxation is theft‚Äù argument is childish bullshit that ignores the basics of society. 

It‚Äôs not theft, it‚Äôs paying the membership fees to take part in society. If you‚Äôre paying more it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre drawing more advantages from that society (by making more money). If you don‚Äôt like the fees go live in the woods totally self sufficiently.

And wealth envy has nothing to do with it. The people that get ‚Äúlocked in cages‚Äù are the poor fuckers like you and me.

I guess I thought she would‚Äôve had one logical leg to stand on in the discussion but she literally had all her political ideas come to her through Facebook, emotion and lies. She couldn‚Äôt admit she was wrong but had to stop talking cause her ego was utterly destroyed. She asked what to do and I literally had to tell her she needs learn how the government works...

It‚Äôs not a fight for ‚Äúequality and fairness‚Äù, it is a fight to take the opposite extreme side of supremacy. This is scary."
6407,ix6ejn,"I'm old enough to remember that this is *not* true. The NFL never ""flipped out"" over anything Tebow did. He never took a knee to ""honor God."" He took a knee to pray, something that is *very* common across all levels of football. Football is a very religious sport and you'd be hard-pressed going to a game and *not* seeing someone pray. His actions were never called divisive. The only thing that was divisive about him was the fan reaction. People felt as though his devout and loyal fanbase did not appropriately reflect the quality of his play. Either way, neither Kaepernick nor Tebow have sniffed an NFL field and neither of them will ever play again, so I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of this post is.

[The Veteran And NFL Player Who Advised Kaepernick To Take A Knee](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/09/646115651/the-veteran-and-nfl-player-who-advised-kaepernick-to-take-a-knee)

‚ÄúRetired Army Green Beret Nate Boyer is the man who first convinced Colin Kaepernick to kneel during the national anthem. 

...what you might not know is why Kaepernick started kneeling to begin with as opposed to something else, and that's where Nate Boyer comes in. He's a former active-duty Green Beret who had a stint in the NFL with the Seattle Seahawks. He initially advised Kaepernick to take a knee instead of sitting down during the anthem as a sign of respect. He recently wrote about this, so we called him.

Nate Boyer, thanks so much for joining us.

NATE BOYER: Yeah. Of course. Thanks for having me.

MARTIN: So take us back. How did you get to talk with Colin Kaepernick to begin with? How did your conversation ensue?

BOYER: You know, this was two years ago, 2016 during the preseason. And he, you know, had sat on the bench. And I think it was actually his third time he'd sat on the bench. But it was the first time it had received national attention. And, you know, he got questioned about it, and he said, well, I'm not going to stand for the flag of a country that oppresses black people and people of color. And then he talked about, you know, social injustices and police brutality and why he thought, you know, he shouldn't be standing for the anthem.

And it struck a chord with me, of course, and it struck a chord with a lot of people - a lot of people in the veteran community as well - because obviously the flag and the anthem and what that stuff stands for means something, you know, very different to us. And I was pretty upset, you know, just because I felt like he didn't understand what those symbols really represent. And - but instead of letting my anger overwhelm me, I decided to relax a little bit, and I wrote this open letter that was just explaining my experiences, my relationship to the flag.

And Colin actually reached out, said he wanted to meet with me. And we sat in the lobby of the team hotel, discussed our situation, our different opinions and feelings about all this. And I suggested him taking a knee instead of sitting even though I wanted him to stand, and he wanted to sit. And it was, like, this compromise that we sort of came to. And that's where the kneeling began.

MARTIN: How did the idea of taking a knee come to you?

BOYER: I thought - at that time I said, look, I think your point has definitely been made that everyone's listening. Like, let's make a plan of attack now. And, you know, let's work on action for it. But he said, you know, what I've committed to this, and - I'm not going to do it until I start to see these changes I want to see. And, you know, I respected that decision and opinion. And I thought kneeling - personally, so I don't speak for everybody, I don't speak for every veteran. I've been told that numerous times by many people. But I thought kneeling was more respectful, and I will say that being alongside his teammates was the biggest thing for me.

And, you know, people - in my opinions and in my experience, kneeling's never been in our history really seen as a disrespectful act. I mean, people kneel when they get knighted. You kneel to propose to your wife, and you take a knee to pray. And soldiers often take a knee in front of a fallen brother's grave to pay respects. So I thought, if anything, besides standing, that was the most respectful. But, of course, that's just my opinion.‚Äù"
6426,ix6ejn,"Look it up if you don't believe it!

If I remember right he also paid a hefty fine for praying on the field, $10k I think."

6429,ix6ejn,"It‚Äôs my understanding that it was his kneeling during the anthem that had people upset. Tebow kneeled during the game in general, but Kap took a knee specifically during the anthem. I would say, regardless if you have a problem with it, there‚Äôs certainly a difference there"
6430,ix6ejn,"To some, to many the NFL, and NBA posturing/preaching is over the top."
6431,ix6ejn,"He took a knee during the national anthem to protest the USA.  His reason for hating America is that he said we are a racist country, as evidenced by police brutality against blacks.  If he hated police brutality alone but loved his country then he could have been comforted by the facts, or supported police reform of some sort, or otherwise separated disdain for police with country.  But the spectacle of a rich mostly white guy who was raised by rich white parents, who played a game for a living, hating on the country that gave him everything deserved all of the contempt he received and more.  If he really hates police brutality, he should try protesting in China.

The NFL leadership absolutely condemned Tebow but celebrated Kaepernick.  Unfortunately the owners also want money, which made him poison to actually hire."

6445,ix6ejn,"I did look it up & it‚Äôs not true. 

[Sourced from this religious website debunking this story. ](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2020/month/day/fact-check-tim-tebow-nfl-kneeling)

‚Äú...the NFL itself did not discourage Tebow or other players from praying before or during games...In fact, when a Muslim player ‚Äî Kansas City Chief safety Husain Abdullah ‚Äî received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for practicing the Sajdah, a religious prayer, after a 2014 touchdown, the NFL quickly condemned the flag.

Also, it...‚Äùfound no record of the NFL having any issues with Tebow‚Äôs kneeling, and as it was a common occurrence among players across the league, we doubt that they ever did.‚Äù

To add to that, [here‚Äôs an article quoting Tebow saying he has no problem with the kneeling protests. ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/06/08/tim-tebow-kneeling-national-anthem/686533002/)"
6446,ix6ejn,"You guys are projecting ... if anything, Tebow praying made him more popular. His prayer stance even became a meme. Was never an issue. Could find no evidence he ever paid any fine either."
6447,ix6ejn,[deleted]
6448,ix6ejn,Yeah of course there is a significant difference between the two. There is also a difference in the consequences of each players action. Kap was essentially blackballed from the league where Tebow simply sucked and eventually faded out of relevance- TT‚Äôs taking the knee didn‚Äôt play a role in that.
6449,ix6ejn,Why shouldn‚Äôt people but allowed to use their platform as a means to spread their beliefs?
6450,ix6ejn,"He was involved in activism for black community IIRC. He promoted police reform and anti-racism. Did he ever explicitly say ‚ÄúI hate America?‚Äù Did those words ever come out of his mouth? I understand he knelt for the national anthem, as a critique of the inequality he believes is present in America. He is exercising his free speech. 
I also believe in the Constitution it says something along the lines of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make the flag into articles of clothing or alter it in any way.‚Äù If the flag is so important and needs so much respect, how come Kap can‚Äôt kneel but police can make blue police USA flags? Doesn‚Äôt seem consistent to me. What‚Äôs so awful about using your platform to say ‚Äúracism is bad.‚Äù Do you disagree with that? Is ‚Äúrespecting the flag‚Äù more important than ‚Äúending racism?‚Äù"
6451,ix6ejn,A vocal minority was shitting all over him. It introduced ‚Äútebowing‚Äù. This was preceded or followed by planking
6452,ix6ejn,"I truly believe that the world needs more expression of religion.  Christianity is the one true religion, and more people need to understand that.  

However, Tebow did kneel on camera, and that is divisive, in that it causes some viewers to stop watching.  The term ""divisive"" does not mean that I disapprove of it.  In fact, I am a Pro-Life Christian myself.

When I say that Kap was ""divisive,"" that doesn't mean that I approve of him. The U.S is not ""slavery at the core,"" but freedom at the core.  We are not the most racist country, far from it!  

That being said, why do you value Tebow, who kneeled during the game and found himself in controversy, but not Kap, who kneeled during the game and found himself (purposefully perhaps) in controversy?  

It's because you value one opinion over the other, just like I do."
6453,ix6ejn,You are absolutely correct. Blm isn't about taking PART they want to take OVER.

6459,ix6ejn,"If you watched football, you would know there was a lot of bitching going on about his actions. Not on the same level as Kaepernick - who started kneeling cause his ass got benched. And when called out on it used ‚Äúoppression against African Americans‚Äù as an excuse.... and decided to roll with that since that‚Äôs what got the most attention.

Edit: I guess all the downvotes are from people that can‚Äôt handle truth."
6460,ix6ejn,Oh. I take it you don‚Äôt remember it being a big deal either. Regardless of what article you can find online. Cool.
6461,ix6ejn,"I didn‚Äôt remember much backlash either, and tried to find an article from that timeframe to shine some light. I found this NY Times article: https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/sports/football/in-tebow-debate-a-clash-of-faith-and-football.html 

They described him as the most polarizing figure in sports. I don‚Äôt remember it being that big! They go on about religion in sports... I figured I‚Äôd share it in case anyone else was curious and wanted to compare to kneeling today and the reaction it gets."
6462,ix6ejn,The point is no violence just memes
6463,ix6ejn,"So, the players did two different things and got two different consequences. If what they did was significantly different from one another, it would make sense that people viewed their actions differently. Kap purposely kneeled during the anthem, an act that a majority of the fans found disrespectful to their nation and to those who died for the flag. Tebow kneeled during the game, something that some found disrespectful to the game of football. Now, personally speaking, I don‚Äôt have that much of a problem with an individual protesting the flag, I think that‚Äôs their right and though I wouldn‚Äôt personally do it, I think it‚Äôs good that they have the ability to do so legally. That said, I understand why someone would have a personal issue with someone protesting the flag, as that personally goes against the nation they live in and identify with. I can‚Äôt see why what Tebow did would personally upset people in the manner that Kap did, as what they did was very different from one another and for very different purposes."
6464,ix6ejn,They will not get my dollar for said platform. Let the Woke take care of that.
6465,ix6ejn,"The inequality in the US is that he gets paid and had opportunities that deserving people didnt.  The federal govt has made no effort to stop his inanities, but that doesn't stop anyone from saying he is a spoiled stupid brat who wouldn't know racism if it blew him at the bus station."
6466,ix6ejn,[And don't forget some kids were being suspended for Tebowing lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_x28VcnZEY)
6467,ix6ejn,"I am saying that you are stumbling onto a path similar to political correctness.  You are on a slippery slope, supporting the censorship of ideas you disagree with, while opposing the censorship of ideas you agree with."
6468,ix6ejn,Yeah idk why I was downvoted for believing a civil war or civil unrest would be a result of this election year.
6469,ix6ejn,Apart of me wants to agree but I feel like black and white issues in the US have really never ended because politicians don‚Äôt want it to end. Divide and conquer is what they say. But you‚Äôre right. Marxists hide in the shadows and wait to strike at the perfect moment. Hopefully we can bounce back
6470,ix6ejn,"honestly, I feel like it was rotting under the surface the whole time. You could hear it in the music, and subtle, hateful way black people talk about white people. I've always judged people for their words and actions, and I've met many good-hearted black people who do the same, but this was always coming, I feel."
6471,ix6ejn,[deleted]
6472,ix6ejn,"Hiccups/bumps, but no more. You‚Äôll see."
6473,ix6ejn,Well the media is allowing it to happen. I don‚Äôt want it nor do I want to participate but I‚Äôm prepared. The media wanting someone to ‚Äúthink‚Äù a certain way works both ways.
6474,ix6ejn,I mean to the anthem. Not in general.
6475,ix6ejn,"If you mean mentally challenged, that is rude. I didn't know that it wasn't playing, as it is a picture. Now that I know that, it's fine for him to kneel."
6476,ix6ejn,"I was on reddit at the time and that was during the time that r/atheism had just become a default sub (to become a default sub at the time you just needed 100k subscribers), it was literally all they talked about for months. But they make a big deal out of anything remotely cross-shaped so that's not exactly the best litmus test for the average reaction, but there was a LOT of ""get your non-sports stuff out of my sports"" going around."
6477,ix6ejn,"Well thats very true. Kap‚Äôs decision of course upset some people (which, let‚Äôs be honest, happens when one protests something). People have the right to be pissed, but it‚Äôs pretty sad how the owners collectively agreed that they disagreed with his free speech and decided to blackball him because he expressed his opinions. I remember Tebow mania, but I honestly don‚Äôt remember the NFL being upset at that? Did I just forget it? I believe some fans got upset, people get upset about anything. But did the NFL actually speak out or really discipline him? Is there a statement or something from the NFL you could give me to read? I legitimately want to know."
6478,ix6ejn,Sure. You are free to spend your money and give your support however you see fit. Thats the beauty of freedom- everyone gets it.
6479,ix6ejn,"Well, his ‚Äúinequality‚Äù is a result of capitalism which allows people to spend freely meaning the NFL rakes in billions of dollars. The opportunities he had were a result of his skill in very popular entertainment industry. The government doesn‚Äôt pay him- the people do. If you‚Äôre so upset about people freely spending their money so Kap can make millions, I suggest you look into democratic socialism :). Also, I never think Kap said ‚ÄúI am the biggest victim of racism and I experience it in every way.‚Äù I think his message was ‚Äúthere is racism in the USA and I am speaking out against it.‚Äù I ask again, is the message ‚Äúracism is bad‚Äù problematic to you?"
6480,ix6ejn,"Yes and no, it's strange because believing like MLK did (""judge a man not on the color of his skin but by the content of his character"") seems to be wrong to the left. There is a whole channel on tv for Black people, affirmative action makes it so people get hired and accepted based on Race. 

I truly believe we were headed the right way we were close to healing the divide, but a united country is much harder to control, if the left would let people be judged on who they are and not what they look like, we would be much better off."

6483,ix6ejn,"He‚Äôs not kneeling for the national anthem though, and according to him he never has kneeled for it"
6484,ix6ejn,Apparently you don‚Äôt watch much football then.
6485,ix6ejn,You must be pretty young or never watched a game in your life.
6486,ix6ejn,"Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe there was some controversy around what Tebow did, but I‚Äôd have no idea of it. As I said, I don‚Äôt see why what Tebow did would cause a public controversy, I just don‚Äôt see that happening from the fans and targeted audience of the NFL. And considering what Kap did certainly did cause a controversy, I understand from the perspective of a business owner as to why they punished him, if an employee or member of a business is being scrutinized by the majority of the targeted audience of the business, it makes sense to me why they‚Äôd want to limit that."
6487,ix6ejn,"Except the NFL has a special antitrust carve out, and is broadcast on licensed and regulated channels.  So crony capitalism at best.  Real racism is bad; but his fake racism based on lies is even worse.  So yes, his specific ""racism is bad in America"" message, intended to incite hatred through lies rather than solve it, is problematic."
6488,ix6ejn,Indefinitely agree with you. It‚Äôs sad that a man like MLK is considered illogical to the left
6489,ix6ejn,Okay. Then is the photo of him kneeling during the game? I'm just wondering.
6490,ix6ejn,I just didn't know when he was kneeling.
6491,ix6ejn,Give me two examples of Kap‚Äôs ‚Äúlies‚Äù about racism in America and how they incite ‚Äúhatred‚Äù
6492,ix6ejn,"Usually he would kneel before the game and any NFL pregame rituals (like the anthem, coin toss, etc) or he would kneel after he scored a TD. So this is either pre-pre-game or after a TD"
6493,ix6ejn,"Police brutality is specifically a problem that affects blacks at a higher rate, and that higher rate is due to racism.  Two lies that are spread to inflame hatred."

6497,ix6ejn,I gotchu bro
6498,ix6ejn,"Do you really lack access to a search engine?  I searched ""Kaepernick statement"" and every result was a different occasion where he said that and worse.  He wants people to believe that America is uniquely bad for racism, even though that is not remotely true."

It basically comes down to how you are defining ""wetness"" ... honestly it's a stupid argument. But from a purely scientific usage, water is indeed not wet.

From the same article: 

""If we define ""wet"" as a sensation that we get when a liquid comes in contact with us, then yes, water is wet to us.

If we define ""wet"" as ""made of liquid or moisture"", then water is definitely wet because it is made of liquid, and in this sense, all liquids are wet because they are all made of liquids. I think that this is a case of a word being useful only in appropriate contexts."""

YET THIS REMAINS IN FUCKING ENGLAND??"
6637,i0b5vv,Still fuck Britain for having more restrictions on freedom.
6638,i0b5vv,how the fuck is churchill racist he fought hitler

6667,i0b5vv,where was this
6668,i0b5vv,He‚Äôs going to get arrested now for vandalism on a monument
6669,i0b5vv,Loving this man for life ‚ù§
6670,i0b5vv,He‚Äôs also one of the big reasons they aren‚Äôt speaking German right now.
6671,i0b5vv,Churchill was both a great leader and a racist.  So we're many of America's slave owning founding fathers. Accept it
6672,i0b5vv,Cue the portable power washer soon.
6673,i0b5vv,Top man.
6674,i0b5vv,I'm not even British but if I was there I would have done the exact same thing. He is not just a British hero he's an international one.
6675,i0b5vv,I'll be his friend. Fuck these guys.
6676,i0b5vv,Fucking hero. Total 1920s British mustache too
6677,i0b5vv,Okay? So what if he was racist? He stopped the persecution of millions of Jews.
6678,i0b5vv,"Centrist here. I overall support the BLM movement but the desecration of statues of American founding fathers, and a former British PM who also spearheaded quite literally everything Britain did for WW2 is too far."

6682,i0b5vv,I like how he ran away like a bitch right after he did that.
6683,i0b5vv,He was tho. Just as almost every leader during WW2.
6684,i0b5vv,How else would you explain them wanting to tell races to act their race under the guise of ‚Äúending racism‚Äù
6685,i0b5vv,"Yeah these fucking morons think he was racist, they should know who he was up against. If it weren‚Äôt for Sir Winston, they wouldn‚Äôt be living in the United Kingdom, and they probably wouldn‚Äôt be speaking English"
6686,i0b5vv,they might but who cares
6687,i0b5vv,Funny enough Churchill had anti-Nazi protesters massacred in Greece killing 28 of them and injuring 128. He allowed the rise of the Nazi party and supported Mussolini‚Äôs rise of fascism. He only went to war with nazis because they threatened to invade Britain.
6688,i0b5vv,Is Britain so fucked that he‚Äôs the one in legal trouble for removing the vandalism from a statue?
6689,i0b5vv,just like here its a joke

6692,i0b5vv,"They think the man who had the biggest contributions in defeating Hitler and the Nazis was a killer and a villain lmao. That man shown in the video is a true patriot, unlike those leftist nut jobs."
6693,i0b5vv,"If they made a statue of him, then he was a racist. Don‚Äôt you know that? /s/"
6694,i0b5vv,‚ÄúThe best arguement against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter.‚Äù -Churchill
6695,i0b5vv,everything
6696,i0b5vv,"Directly caused the starvation of millions of Indians in WWII and said it was ""there fault for breeding like rabbits"" and actually has plenty of racist remarks but as a history student he was a great politician and urged the British Gov to take action against Germany in the 1930s so a hero in my book but also a racist"
6697,i0b5vv,"I did have to google this, but the direct quote ""the Aryan stock is bound to triumph"" and calling all non-whites savages unfit to govern themselves is fairly damning"
6698,i0b5vv,"It is possible to be a racist and a hero and a patriot. Churchill was all these things to different people. He did heroic things for Britain and stood up for Britains interest. But he was dead against Britain handing over rule of India back to the Indians and was a forceful advocate of using chemical weapons to suppress rebellions in Iraq, Afghanistan and India. There's also the issue around the Bengal famine and this quote and several others like it. Which is pretty racist. 


In 1937, he told the Palestine Royal Commission: ""I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place."""
6699,i0b5vv,"Well, to be fair, he was only a hero in Europe. His actions lead to the death of about a million people in India, so there is that."
6700,i0b5vv,"That depends who you ask, sure Churchill did a lot of good but he also did a lot of bad, under his leadership during the first great War Britain lied and stole land from Arab people unde the secret scopes-picot pact, he sent hundreds of Indian, British, and other colonial forces, to their deaths at Gallipoli in a fuedal attempt to size the ottoman capital and avoid attacking future French territory, basically anything Churchill did before or after ww2 was pretty destructive, infacf its honestly amazing he kept getting promoted with his track record."
6701,i0b5vv,Hero? What about Bengal famine?
6702,i0b5vv,So was fredrick Douglass
6703,i0b5vv,"""I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.""

This is a Churchill quote. While I agree that he is probably the greatest leader in British history and played an extremely vital role in the Allies winning WW2 and should be admired for those things, is it not at least justifiable to call him a racist and detest him for THOSE ideas that he held?

Edit: structure"
6704,i0b5vv,Tell those who starved in Bangladesh that.
6705,i0b5vv,Not really.
6706,i0b5vv,He stopped hitler but he was mean so bad
6707,i0b5vv,it saved the world
6708,i0b5vv,"I'm glad he is existed , if he wasn't we would be hearing this; Ich Adolf Hitler habe endlich Gro√übritannien erobert!"
6709,i0b5vv,BLM is the answer.
6710,i0b5vv,yep
6711,i0b5vv,Do republicans genuinely feel like nationalism is something to be encouraged? I grew up thinking patriotism was ok but nationalism was taking it a bit too far and led to a lot of issues and I‚Äôm just curious
6712,i0b5vv,ya ya
6713,i0b5vv,They‚Äôre literally called fascists in the mainstream in order to alienate them
6714,i0b5vv,"I don't think recognizing that Churchill was an amazing person and removing stupid shit from a statue of him counts as ""right winger""."
6715,i0b5vv,ya ya
6716,i0b5vv,ya god bless
6717,i0b5vv,"No they wouldn‚Äôt lmao. They would just get up in his face or throw their soy lattes at him. These people aren‚Äôt tough, they‚Äôre cowards. If they wanna get up in my face or chase me like that, I‚Äôd knock em in the jaw. All they would do is cry ‚ÄúRACIST‚Äù"
6718,i0b5vv,Lol not like their police can do much anyway. They aren‚Äôt allowed to carry guns.
6719,i0b5vv,he is not even a cop he is just one of us
6720,i0b5vv,"""Sir you got a licence for that patriotism?"""
6721,i0b5vv,in this time yes
6722,i0b5vv,i wish man
6723,i0b5vv,"Pretty sure in the full clip, three go after him. The same cops that sat and watched while those rioters defaced the statue."
6724,i0b5vv,"Churchill was absolutely the sort of wartime leader we needed, he was instrumental in keeping up moral and leading us during WW2... HOWEVER he truly was a thorough racist and has the blood of millions on his hands not just through his policies but through direct political action. He's loathed all over the world for his actions outside of WW2 from Ireland to India. Feel free to look up his various exploits in 'peacetime'"
6725,i0b5vv,">  we all now how that went.

Apparently not all of us. I know it, you know it. 

The ‚Äòwoke‚Äô haven‚Äôt gotten the message yet apparently."
6726,i0b5vv,true true
6727,i0b5vv,By this logic we can say the same about Stalin.
6728,i0b5vv,So if I had to pick a racist or a racist I should be happy I got the racist ? What type of mental gymnastics do you people be doing? Literally took me 3 minutes to see what his views were on race and determine them weak ass statues should come down.
6729,i0b5vv,when did they get into it
6730,i0b5vv,"I know 15 years of Conservative government and the countrys gone to the dogs. Almost like their incompetent toffs that dont know what their doing...

But dont worry you Americans will be able to rape and pillage my homeland after brexit goes through"
6731,i0b5vv,well all need to protect our land no matter where we are
6732,i0b5vv,and the hero we need
6733,i0b5vv,indeed
6734,i0b5vv,Litter at killed millions of people in India on purpose and was a profound racist for his time. Don‚Äôt use the hitler argument because Stalin could be put in the exact same way. Just because one is bad doesn‚Äôt make the other good
6735,i0b5vv,ya ya
6736,i0b5vv,he is the cops
6737,i0b5vv,do you mean ‚Äòinstrumental‚Äô
6738,i0b5vv,try explain that to a leftist. you're preaching to the choir here.
6739,i0b5vv,and thats why we need him
6740,i0b5vv,"Stalin also fought the nazis, does it mean he also deserves statues?"
6741,i0b5vv,don't worry we have him
6742,i0b5vv,they need to learn from mistakes and not commit them today
6743,i0b5vv,i'm also gen z but some day us gops will loose it and re gain america
6744,i0b5vv,we need peolpe like him here we really do
6745,i0b5vv,i think he is a fan of churchill like us
6746,i0b5vv,that man should be a war hero 1 vs 100 he won
6747,i0b5vv,now we all want that jacket
6748,i0b5vv,they need to see it throw ww2 eyes then they would stop
6749,i0b5vv,i mean adleast here they sound normal
6750,i0b5vv,crazy stuff
6751,i0b5vv,i mean lets get real its bad but if there happy then hey
6752,i0b5vv,Imagine judging Britain by London and Edinburgh lmao
6753,i0b5vv,You can hate other races while also defending your country from someone attacking your country. Hell many white American racists hate white Americans who have communist or socialist views.
6754,i0b5vv,good

6785,i0b5vv,love the mustache
6786,i0b5vv,YES YES YES YES
6787,i0b5vv,i respect you i support cops but i am glad you agree
6788,i0b5vv,he takes matter into his own hands
6789,i0b5vv,"The statue is recognizing him as a World War 2 hero. He was not perfect, but nor were any of historical figures. If that statue was put up to to celebrate something bad he did then you have a good case for tearing it down. But that statue went up because he rallied the British nation to fight when all seemed lost. That's why there are statues of him, because we are honoring his resolve."
6790,i0b5vv,He's a fundamental part of british history and a hero. He deserves his statue.
6791,i0b5vv,He saved the world.  Literally.
6792,i0b5vv,"Bro, the statue is not for him because what he did on the colonies, it is because europe would be under nazi rule whitout him."
6793,i0b5vv,"Yes, someone from the early 1900s was a racist. Why can people not rap there head around this"
6794,i0b5vv,long post
6795,i0b5vv,"I might have some typos, I didn't revise it."
6796,i0b5vv,you want him to die
6797,i0b5vv,yes
6798,i0b5vv,He wasn‚Äôt a perfect man but he was the hero we had and a crucial part in saving western democracy.
6799,i0b5vv,English? They‚Äôll soon be speaking Arabic. But at least it‚Äôs not German! Churchill must be absolutely spinning in his grave. All that effort just to have the commies and nazis walk in through the front door and take over the place without a shot fired.
6800,i0b5vv,"No, instead they speak Arabic now."
6801,i0b5vv,"But he was racist? He said he hated Indians and called them a beastly people with a beastly religion

I'm not saying woah I wish he never existed and Hitler should've taken over the UK but, let's not tell ourselves lies, the guy was a racist."
6802,i0b5vv,He was racist though. Just because Hitler was arguably more racist doesn't mean he wasn't.
6803,i0b5vv,"Lol. Halifax is the only one REMOTELY likely to have lost the war, by surrendering the moment France fell. And even in that case, a German actually crossing the Channel is less likely than one reaching the Urals. Both were just about impossible. 

Don‚Äôt deify the man. He did well, but there were many people who could have won that war with allies like the US and the Soviets."
6804,i0b5vv,"Sadly yes, ""bEcAUsE hEs cOMmiTTiNG a rAcISm""."
6805,i0b5vv,"When they meet people they say ‚Äú hi, the name is Todd, reTodd‚Äù"
6806,i0b5vv,I work with special needs. They don‚Äôt act this way.
6807,i0b5vv,"it makes sense from their point of view, after all they are the living nightmare of Orwells, you just read 1984, and you will see the scary resemblance. And who was 1984 written after ? Hitler.

SJW may claim that everyone they don't like is Hitler, but in reality, they act more like the Nazis than anyone else in late history. They hate seeing their hero downgraded."
6808,i0b5vv,We should call them Nazi sympathizers to fuck with them
6809,i0b5vv,"They would deface a Mother Theresa statue. Their simple minds statue=bad, must be ruined."
6810,i0b5vv,i hope he dose
6811,i0b5vv,"They aren't accusing him of being a killer, they're accusing him on being racist. He absolutely was [racist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_views_of_Winston_Churchill)."
6812,i0b5vv,Wait there is an obama statue so that must mean....
6813,i0b5vv,"Nah, surely if they made a statue of him then that means he was perfect and can definitely have done no wrong, ever."
6814,i0b5vv,"The thing about leftists is that they can‚Äôt seem to judge people in the context of their era and values. While that quote is obviously racist today, it was just the average belief in the 1930s.  But leftists are unable to not look at history and judge it with the knowledge that we have now."
6815,i0b5vv,Oh c'mon it's not like brits celebrate him for the Bengal famine or his racist world view. They celebrate him because he kicked the Nazis and I'd say that's pretty fucking cool.
6816,i0b5vv,"I can‚Äôt speak for all republicans but I think it‚Äôs perfectly fine to encourage nationalism.

I just now googled the definition of nationalism and it means patriotic feelings, principles or efforts. I know sometimes people define it as one thinking there country is superior to another, but I did not mean this I meant just patriotic feelings."
6817,i0b5vv,Nationalism is great and makes a nation strong. Blindly following your leaders is not.
6818,i0b5vv,You want to double check what nationalism means.
6819,i0b5vv,What you think nationalism is and what I think nationalism is are most likely 2 different definitions. I think of it as lots of patriotism and love for a country.
6820,i0b5vv,Yeah I think you're right
6821,i0b5vv,"They don't see the difference, that's the problem."
6822,i0b5vv,It does now
6823,i0b5vv,"I‚Äôve seen this stuff happen in the US.
Real cowards gang up on a man, beat them to unconsciousness, and cower in fear watching him bleed and pussy out of calling the police"
6824,i0b5vv,"I mean...people have been murdered by mobs recently in the US. People have been shot etc, dont underestimate mob mentality. Especially in places where the police are being forced to stand by. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean cower in fear, just don't be wreckless."
6825,i0b5vv,They‚Äôre only cowards when it‚Äôs a fair fight. They‚Äôll beat you to death if they have a crowd of people with them
6826,i0b5vv,*So Brave.*
6827,i0b5vv,Ummm child anyways BLM
6828,i0b5vv,"Yep. 

Hitler = Bad, Mussolini = Bad

Churchill = Good, Stalin = Good.

That's how it works, right?"
6829,i0b5vv,And he was such a jolly fella!
6830,i0b5vv," No one wants to do that last thing, sorry."
6831,i0b5vv,"Bruh, do you just spend your day browsing conservative subs just looking for someone to argue with? Fuckin get a life."
6832,i0b5vv,You don‚Äôt have to reply to every comment on your post bud
6833,i0b5vv,no
6834,i0b5vv,Churchill=saved the world.  Stalin= murdered millions of his own people.  These things are not the same.  So no.  He doesn't get a statue.
6835,i0b5vv,"I‚Äôve got one after embracing the Anglo Saxon side of the family, time to grow a moustache I think"
6836,i0b5vv,Can you please tell me more about how is that possible?
6837,i0b5vv,"I think you meant -BLM but yeah. A Confederate Statue did nearly nothing good. Tear it down, I don't give a fuck. They contributed nothing to society but pain and horrors. Churchill was a fuckin badass war hero."
6838,i0b5vv,Plus it's a crime to deface the statue. If you gonna do something do it peacefully. I dunno like a petition.
6839,i0b5vv,Good Lord.....
6840,i0b5vv,"I support cops but I just think no one should have to lose their life to one just because of the color of their skin, but I remember my outrage when I learned what ACAB meant and how stupid it was/is. \~95% cops are good, the justice department just has to make a vehement effort to rid the bad ones is what I think."

6842,i0b5vv,No.

6850,i0b5vv,god i love this subreddit
6851,i0b5vv,"Especially considering before it was the Nazi party, it was the socialist party in Germany. Hitler of course was chancellor for that as well. They are so jaded and want to create this notion that republicans, and conservatives are some type of fascist Nazi group is idiotic. They are so desperate to rewrite history to hide the blood of millions on their hands from those that were proslavery, confederates, pro Indian Bill by Andrew Jackson,which of course led to the Trail of Tears and then leading to other such issues, Civil War is a huge part of that. In UK it was Chamberlain who wanted to kowtow to Hitler and keep up this farce thinking ‚ÄúOh my Germany buddy, mein bester Freund, wouldn‚Äôt dare do that!‚Äù He was a coward, and willing to let a madman take over Europe. Churchill was really their only hope and he drove them to greatness. Without Churchill, it would‚Äôve gone down in flames. Honestly to us Americans he‚Äôs a hero and he‚Äôs revered as such. NEVER SURRENDER!"
6852,i0b5vv,I do sometimes .

All of human history is filled with acts and beliefs that make the present gasp. Live in the moment and respect the great contributions like what Churchill made like not surrendering to Germany and helping eliminate the Nazi's. If he would have offered a truce to Germany in 1940  after the allies were kicked out of mainland France, the world would be very different right now.

&#x200B;

The lack of perspective in today's world is mind numbing. Everyone's ancestors were complicit in atrocities in some way or another. You have in some way  either benefited from a tribe in taking out another (pre civilization 5000 bc or native american wars), benefited from imperialism (whether USA, European, Chinesee)....just buying products online you are complicit with cheap overseas labor, pollution, etc.... 

Is there a scorecard on good? My  2x great grandpa fought for the union in the civil war and lost his ability to walk. My great great grandpa fought in an indian war. My grandpas fought in WW2. Is my lineage in the positive?"

6859,i0b5vv,"I struggle a little with this because what makes ‚Äúaverage belief‚Äù justifiable? Let‚Äôs say for instance EVERYONE in Nazi Germany agreed with Hitler‚Äôs ideals and practices. Then should German‚Äôs today not judge Hitler/nazi Germany citizens based on things things they did/believed because that was the average belief at the time?

That may be a bad example, so apologies if my point doesn‚Äôt come across quite clearly. And on the other side of this argument: is it fair to retroactively punish someone for doing something that wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwrong‚Äù at the time? Maybe not, according to ex facto laws."
6860,i0b5vv,"Ah yes, because at some point in history, racism was morally good, right?


No. Slavery and racism have and always will be MORALLY DEPLORABLE. 

You just tried to defend a shameless racist. Shame on you."
6861,i0b5vv,This response is more of what politics needs! An calm discussion and expressed views and opinions. Thank you.

6884,i0b5vv,"Its anti authoritarian, it critiques elements of Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany"
6885,i0b5vv,"It‚Äôs mostly a critique on authoritarianism and deprivation of freedom in general. Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War against Franco, a fascist, in favor of the preservation of democracy. That‚Äôs where his idea for 1984 came from"
6886,i0b5vv,"Isn‚Äôt there grounds to dislike anyone in this world? Everyone is so fixated on the negativity in people. Last time I checked, no one is perfect but there are good qualities in everyone, but people would rather focus on the bad."
6887,i0b5vv,"It's true, culture has shifted tremendously from the time when Churchill was in power.

I don't think that means we should just dismiss all his negative qualities as being ""normal at the time"" though. His views on race weren't more correct just because he held them 80 years ago. They were still wrong at the time, it just was more socially acceptable to act that way. There were plenty of people that didn't agree with his racist viewpoints. 

Statues are, at least in my view, supposed to be representations of people who are venerated by the society they exist in. There are plenty of examples of statues being torn down as a result of large shifts in culture (e.g. removal of dictators). If society no longer venerates an individual for whatever reason, I don't see any problem with their statue being removed and placed in a museum or other such place."
6888,i0b5vv,"I agree, but from the video I don't think anyone is discrediting his war effort, but rather drawing attention to the fact that even our respected traditional heroes are steeped in our history with racism."
6889,i0b5vv,"The references are all linked in the wiki article, if you care to read it."
6890,i0b5vv,You know wikipedia lists [sources](https://winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour-extras/churchill-and-eugenics-1/) right?
6891,i0b5vv,South Dakota apparently.
6892,i0b5vv,"Racism was never morally good, don‚Äôt put words in my mouth libtard. Racism was accepted as normal and a structure of life back then, just as much as we accept that some countries are better than others today, perhaps we will be judged by this and other principles we hold to be true by our descendants, who knows.

But you‚Äôre inability to judge history in context and through the lens of the time shows that you are as ignorant as you are immature, and your virtue signaling does nothing but show that you still have much to learn and understand."
6893,i0b5vv,So would you prefer standing praising a country when it does something right or praising a country when it does something wrong?

6897,i0b5vv,"Yup, at least once a month, i take my boy out with me to LA or San Francisco just to go find and kill beggars on the street. It‚Äôs a great father son bonding moment, although my son ain‚Äôt the best at it, he‚Äôll get better with time.

6899,i0b5vv,"I'm glad you are asking the question.  I'm not a history expert, but I can tell you at the start of WW2 he stood up to and fought, almost alone,  against Hitler.  Hitler had invaded Poland and France and was well on his way to world domination.  The US was reluctant to get involved and he was up against opposition in his own government.  It is very likely that if  Churchill wasnt the force that he was, Hitler would have succeeded. 
Hitler was true evil.  He murdered the Jews so he could take their money and finance his war machine.  He did this everywhere he went.  Not only Jews, he wanted to kill and enslave the world."

6902,i0b5vv,"You‚Äôre giving in to a shallow and stupid mentality where we judge historical figures solely by their most atrocious acts as we perceive them today rather than recognizing their influence on the modern world and achievements.

It‚Äôs just pretending that we are the most enlightened humans to gift the planet with our presence."
6903,i0b5vv,"He didn‚Äôt fight for democracy. He fought for Stalin and the Communists. He realized that Stalin was horrible and the Communists were horrible too. 

He never stopped being a socialist, because he felt it could be controlled and not fall into totalitarianism, but in that point he was wrong. Socialism always collapses into totalitarian nightmares."
6904,i0b5vv,">no one is perfect but there are good qualities in everyone

Maybe this is a better message to be sending then, rather than idolising people who sometimes do good things for bad reasons and vilifying people who sometimes do bad things for good reasons."
6905,i0b5vv,"Pretty busy atm at work, thats why I asked"
6906,i0b5vv,"That‚Äôs a good question, honestly I would praise my country when it does something right which makes sense. But just because my country does not do something right doesn‚Äôt mean my patriotic views of my country are lessen. I know what this country is founded on and I have an appreciation for that."

6913,i0b5vv,[removed]
6914,i0b5vv,ok
6915,i0b5vv,"Possibly, but I think you're also failing to acknowledge that culture, and the standards by which we judge people, advances and things change. 

Many statues and icons have existed in the past that no longer do. What about all the pagan iconography that was torn down to allow Christian ones to replace them? Should that have been allowed to stay as well? 

Things change. No one is asking for history to be written but perhaps historical figures that no longer fit with culture should be moved to a history museum with the rest of that stuff."
6916,i0b5vv,"Yes, the Republicans (The Socialist movement not the party) were indeed socialist but what they envisioned was a government similar to modern day Spain. A social-democracy that‚Äôs barely staying afloat.

I do agree with you. His ideals were similar to Sander‚Äôs today, flawed and misleading. Spain, France, and Sweden are all examples of what Orwell thought to be the perfect system but in reality it‚Äôs a mostly government controlled economy that is extremely unstable."
6917,i0b5vv,He never fought for Stalin he was supporting POUM and CNT-FAI which were Anti-Stalin
6918,i0b5vv,So no one is allowed to have role models because at some point they might have done a bad.
6919,i0b5vv,"I skimmed it and it seems he never wrote a 'Mein Kampf"" style manifesto, but there is evidence from his policy direction and also quotes from his contemporaries that paint him as being pretty strongly racist.

At that time in Britain there is no way he would have succeeded in politics by being openly racist, so it kind of comes down to a ""who do you believe"" type situation. There also isn't really much evidence of him pushing policies that were pro racial equality."
6920,i0b5vv,Ah now I see why echo chambers on Reddit exist.
6921,i0b5vv,"I‚Äôm really sorry that you are going thru that there, and dealing with an incompetent mayor. You‚Äôre still an American with rights as reinforced by our constitution and bill of rights. I stand with you! We are the silent majority!"
6922,i0b5vv,I‚Äôm in Chicago too. Our mayor sucks
6923,i0b5vv,I vote for my values. I couldn‚Äôt care less about money. But the right actually does more to help poor people than the left ever can.
6924,i0b5vv,"There‚Äôs basically no comparison between Julius ceaser/Churchill and Pagans. By your comparison, it would be more accurate for like, nazi Germany to invade the UK and tear down the Churchill statue. Now take a look at who is tearing down what and tell me what they are."
6925,i0b5vv,"Stalin was never going to let them be like that. If he won, they were going to quickly have the Red Terror like Lenin did."
6926,i0b5vv,"Didn‚Äôt say he did. I did say that Stalin supported them. Stalin helped with the International Brigades, 1000 planes almost 1000 tanks, etc. 

Orwell did start to see how bad the Communists there were and continued to see how bad the Communists were over the next decade."
6927,i0b5vv,"There is a difference between having role models and idol worship. 

Also if your role models are known racists it might be time to find better role models."

6930,i0b5vv,"Cultural shifts don't only happen through invasions and occupations. Political revolutions, civil wars, etc are all equally as important."
6931,i0b5vv,"The leader of the movement, Jos√© Diaz, was not very sympathetic with Stalin so I‚Äôd doubt he would have joined the Third International. He would be a Tito-style of leader but that doesn‚Äôt say Stalin would sponsor a coup for a more friendly communist government."
6932,i0b5vv,"No worries. Don't just take my word for it though, you might come to a different conclusion than me. Always good to do the research if you get time."
6933,i0b5vv,"Oh that is super ironic and wrong but once again this sub just proves ""people like me"" right. Hell I can't even respond more than once every 7 minutes. Just check out the people who responded to me and see how ""civil"" they're being; I haven't seen such blatant hypocrisy in my life. But it's cool it's not surprising a lot of right winged subs are echo chambers that are quick to silence anyone that disagrees with then regardless of what they did. Even the original person I was responding to asked a simple question and got downvoted. I just find it funny how big of a pity party y'all throw yourselves."
6934,i0b5vv,"But not everyone agrees with you, in fact the vast majority of people don‚Äôt want a cultural shift, it‚Äôs the most rabid and ill-informed people who want to tear down statutes of Churchill, most of them are sheep and being lead along with no idea what they are doing. 

You guys are the same people who want to burn books with troubled protagonists or anti-hero‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt utterly perfect oppressed trans-Africa migrant quadriplegic veteran single mom Muslim social rights activists. Churchill stood up to nazis, and don‚Äôt forget that he lived in a world that appeased nazis. He‚Äôs a powerful figure of his time and is worthy of having a statute, even if it offends the infants in our society"

7000,i0e7gb, The world isn‚Äôt a zero sum game. Police can need reform in the United States and China can be guilty of genocide and need reprimand at the same time. One doesn‚Äôt negate the other.

We turn a blind eye to China due to the amount of business we have in the country and unwillingness to lose it.

It is true but it isn't due to one side, though it definitely is true-er for one side than the other...

7019,i0e7gb,"Im not saying what is happening in china is good because something really needs to be done, but since what is happening with the cops affects the american population directly and what is happening in china doesnt affet thrm directly, i think its kimda obvious why they are reporting on the cops and not on the murder of the uyghers."

7063,i0e7gb,So do you just go off opinion? I mean. Sheesh
7064,i0e7gb,You need to look at relevant data. The entire black population is not being pulled over or interacting with police. You have to look at the race of police interactions and the number of those that turn violent or deadly.
7065,i0e7gb,Blacks commit far more crimes per capita and have more interactions with cops per capita.
7066,i0e7gb,Yea because other blacks are killing them. Also the majority of these news stories with white cops killing blacks are untrue. It's usually multiple cops with one or two of them being white. The other offending officers of color are left out by the media to paint a picture of racism. Also most all major cities are policed by black officers. These cities are the areas with the majority of the issues.
7067,i0e7gb,Don't be lazy. Look it up. If you care to know the truth you would be doing your own research.
7068,i0e7gb,It‚Äôs the truth. I‚Äôm not going to care that some people hate reality.
7069,i0e7gb,Learn history. Muslims have committed genocide repeatedly. There is a good chance Muslims have murdered far more people than communists have. They have wiped out entire peoples and religions repeatedly throughout history. They are never ever the good guys.

7077,i0e7gb,LOL. Not really.
7078,i0e7gb,I meant exactly just that kind of stuff I said.
7079,i0e7gb,Thats because they're targeted more
7080,i0e7gb,I agree black on black crime is a major issue. But I was just trying to say that while cops do kill more whites it's simply because of the demographics. Cops kill more blacks per capita than they kill white people.
7081,i0e7gb,It shouldn't be on the reader to prove or disprove a claim the author made. The author's responsibility is to back up statements he/she made

7088,i0e7gb,"You said ‚Äújust that kind of just‚Äù, it kinda sounds like that you don‚Äôt think that it is such a big deal."
7089,i0e7gb,They commit more crimes because they‚Äôre targeted more? Or they‚Äôre targeted more because they commit more crimes?
7090,i0e7gb,"No they aren‚Äôt lol. Their culture normalizing murder, rape, robbery, violent crime and illegal possession of guns is why they have more interactions with the police. About equal interactions with police btw despite only making up around 13% of the population. 

Go live in an all white small town area, then go live in an all black area (the hood). Tell me which one you feel more safe in. Tell me which one you would rather have your kids grow up in. Tell me which one you would trust leaving your car/house unlocked for a day in. 

Better yet, go find me one predominantly black area that isn‚Äôt riddled with crime. 

It‚Äôs not racist to admit black culture is a serious issue in America, anyone who tries to convince you it is isn‚Äôt on the side of the American people.

Edit: don‚Äôt comment back to this man using reasonable thinking. He will send you 10 messages, all books on how you are a racist pos and the problem with America and how he got an A in college English for writing about black areas not having anymore crime than white areas (absolutely any statistic will show this isn‚Äôt true, hell even driving through these areas will show this isn‚Äôt true)"
7091,i0e7gb,More crime = more encounters with police
7092,i0e7gb,"The denominator can't be the entire population of whites or blacks in the country, because not every person interacts with police, and you can't be killed by police if you dont interact with them. You have to divide by the number of interactions that each race has with police, and when you do that, you find that blacks are not killed at a higher rate than whites."
7093,i0e7gb,Ok. I'll get right on that....
7094,i0e7gb,You have zero clue obviously. Germany wasn‚Äôt Christian. Second on the hit list of the Nazi‚Äôs was Christians. Native Americans were wiping each other out long before anyone else did. You sound like a clueless whiny millennial with absolutely no idea about anything that happened before you were born.
7095,i0e7gb,"What‚Äôs wrong with the AP Stylebook? Isn‚Äôt it just a guide for grammar, capitalization, punctuation, mundane things like that?"
7096,i0e7gb,"Oh, are you concerned about my level of concern? You should concern yourself with something and someone other than me."
7097,i0e7gb,"I think the point that he failed to explain properly was that black people are targeted more and therefore are caught more often than white people committing crimes. 
Personally, I think it‚Äôs likely a cultural thing causing the crime rate difference."
7098,i0e7gb,"Consider why there's more crime. Over-policing 60 years ago (Jim Crow era) put everyone's father in prison. Prison means difficulty finding a job, caring for your kids. No money & no father means kids are joining gangs, don't go to school. Poor performance in school means defunding. There's a school to prison pipeline for fatherless kids in poverty. The solution isn't more police, its more deeply rooted than that."
7099,i0e7gb,"Show me the car fax. Everything I have read that disclosed all used number disagree with you point of view. Those decide to not reveal all metrics I don't really take seriously, being that I know how to read statistics and know just how easy it is to use the same facts to prove the whatever agenda if you omit  metrics selectively."
7100,i0e7gb,Maybe just maybe half of my cherokee ancestors wouldn't give wiped out if Jackson didn't make the Trail of Tears. Whites killed more natives than anyone else.
7101,i0e7gb,"Lol 
You are the only one with zero clue 

Nazi were Christians not commies they had Celtic Cross too 

Your crusades and colonization(Chanting 'God save the queen') no one forgets that

And don't come with that BS that Native Americans were wiping each other 

There were disputes among them
but who gave you Christians the right to wipe out thier entire race 

I have read your history that how you people use to trade products from them and in return you people gave them food with poison in it so they die"
7102,i0e7gb,So you think what China is doing is okay then??
7103,i0e7gb,What you call cultural I'm going to call poverty and desperation and surval mechanisms.
7104,i0e7gb,Saying Andrew Jackson was a scumbag for what he did is something everyone can agree with.
7105,c63kex,I appreciate the irony of using the Lisa Simpson meme to make this point.
7106,c63kex,"Are people fairly averse to talking about what our tax dollars do for us?I pay a metric ton in federal/state taxes and I know there is quite a few of us in this country doing the same.

In 2009, a strategy culminated as expected, with the fed (the taxpayer), bailing out a significant portion of industry to help the economy recover. From what I have read, this was not necessarily a mistake, it was a strategy based on the understanding that a government will act in the interest of stability and growth and help you, even if you are the party sabotaging this interest.

It almost seems like it is taboo to scrutinize this injustice. Meanwhile, many in the financial sector build their wealth and manage their risk around manipulating the existence of an entity known as a government.

Everyone wants change and free stuff but no one wants to pay for it.

There is ups and downs to both sides of that coin. Sweden is a great example of a country that used to be mostly capitalist. They had one of the strongest economy in the world for a number of decades. Then they put out a bunch of social policies. Now their economy is much weaker and they are rolling back some of their policies to compensate and to help their economy recover. Countries like this are also very hard to grow rich in.

7476,j4h3rq,Because Reddit is cancer and full of communists.
7477,j4h3rq,"It is a fact that the demographic which uses social media is left leaning as a majority:

*Users who are Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say these sites are important to them personally for engaging in certain types of civic activities. Some 55% of Democrats say that social media is very or somewhat important to them for getting involved with political or social issues that are important to them, compared with 32% of Republicans who say the same (including those who lean to each party). Similar partisan gaps are evident when the issue is the importance of social media in finding others who share users‚Äô views (54% vs. 36%) and in giving users a venue to express their political opinions (47% vs. 33%).*

([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/07/13/activism-on-social-media-varies-by-race-and-ethnicity-age-political-party/))

Some of this issue is due to the censorship of political speech on social media. Left leaning users approve of the censorship, while right leaning users disapprove of the censorship: 

*Partisanship is a key factor in views about the issue. Fully 73% of Democrats say they strongly or somewhat approve of social media companies labeling posts on their platforms from elected officials as inaccurate or misleading. On the other hand, 71% of Republicans say they at least somewhat disapprove of this practice. Republicans are also far more likely than Democrats to say they have no confidence at all that social media companies would be able to determine which posts on their platforms should be labeled as inaccurate or misleading (50% vs. 11%).*

([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/08/19/most-americans-think-social-media-sites-censor-political-viewpoints/))

Additionally the majority of American users of social media today describe the political interactions they have using social media as negative ones (regardless of political views):

*Americans who use social media sites are also more likely today than in 2016 to describe the political discourse on these platforms in negative terms. Seven-in-ten now say they find it ‚Äústressful and frustrating‚Äù to talk about politics on social media with people they disagree with, up from 59% in 2016. At the same time, the share who say they find these interactions ‚Äúinteresting and informative‚Äù has dropped from 35% to 26% over the past four years.*

*The new survey also finds that social media users generally do not find common ground as a result of online discussions about politics. Roughly seven-in-ten users (72%) say that discussing politics on social media with people they disagree with usually leads them to find out they have ‚Äúless in common politically‚Äù than they expected, while 22% report finding out they have ‚Äúmore in common politically‚Äù than previously thought.*

([source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/19/55-of-u-s-social-media-users-say-they-are-worn-out-by-political-posts-and-discussions/%3famp=1))

So the gist of it is that the social media user base leans left, those users generally approve of censorship of ideas and speech on the platforms, and more people than ever on both sides find the conversations they‚Äôre having about politics on social media to be of no real value at the end of the day. 

Social media is inundated with left leaning views and as a platform, at the behest of their left leaning user base, freely censors dissenting views. This has destroyed real discourse, debate and discussion in the online realm in a productive and meaningful way for people on both sides of the aisle.

I‚Äôve yet to find a poll on this, but I suspect these conditions are creating a trend where republicans and conservatives are increasingly turning away from social media for political discourse, exacerbating the problems that have caused that trend in the first place.

The most boiled down answer that can possibly be rendered for this question; the left has created an echo chamber online. That‚Äôs why Reddit, and most of social media, has turned into a dumpster fire."

7479,j4h3rq,"Politicians are the only people in the world who create problems and then campaign against them.¬†

Have you ever wondered why, if both the Democrats and the Republicans are against deficits, WHY we have deficits? 

Have you ever wondered why, if all the politicians are against inflation and high taxes, WHY do we have inflation and high taxes? 

We the people do not propose a federal budget. The president does.¬†

We the People do not have the Constitutional authority to vote on appropriations. The House of Representatives does. We the People don't write the tax code, Congress does. We the People don't set fiscal policy, Congress does. 

We the People don't control monetary policy, the Federal Reserve Bank does. 

100 Senators, 435 Congressmen, 1 President, 9 Supreme Court justices - 545 human beings. Out of the 350 million legal citizens, 50 million illegals, the politicians are directly, legally, morally, and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country. 

I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because that problem was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency to a federally chartered, but private, Central Bank. 

I exclude all the special interests and lobbyists for a reason. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a president to do one stinking thing. I don't care if they offer a politician $1 million dollars in cash. The politician has the power to accept or reject it. No matter what the lobbyist promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes. 

These 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing you that what they did is not their fault. They cooperate in this huge con regardless of party. What separates a politician from a normal human being is an excessive amount of gall. No normal human being would have the gall of a Speaker, who stood up and criticized the President for creating deficits. The president can only propose a budget. He cannot force the Congress to accept it. 

The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, gives sole responsibility to the House of Representatives for originating and approving appropriations and taxes. Nancy Pelosi is the speaker of the House. She is the leader of the majority party. She and fellow House members, not the president, can approve any budget they want. If the president vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to. 

What is inconceivable to me is that a nation of 350 million cannot replace 545 people who stand convicted -- by present facts -- of incompetence and irresponsibility. I can't think of a single domestic problem that is not traceable directly to those 545 people. When you fully grasp the plain truth that 545 people exercise the power of the federal government, then it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist. 

If the tax code is unfair, it's because they want it unfair.¬† If the budget is in the red, it's because they want it in the red. 

If the Military is in IRAQ and Afghanistan, it's because they want them there.¬† If they do not receive social security but are on an elite retirement plan not available to the people, it's because they want it that way. 

There are no insoluble government problems.¬† Do not let these 545 people shift the blame to bureaucrats, whom they hire and whose jobs they can abolish or to lobbyists, whose gifts and advice they can reject or to regulators, to whom they give the power to regulate and from whom they can take this power. Above all, do not let them con you into the belief that there exists disembodied mystical forces like ""the economy,"" ""inflation,"" or ""politics"" that prevent them from doing what they take an oath to do. Those 545 people and they alone, are responsible. They and they alone, have the power. They and they alone, should be held accountable by the people who are their bosses -provided the voters have the gumption to manage their own employees. 

We should vote all of them out of office and clean up their mess!

Guys, I'm European and I am not into being horrible about others. I can only tell you about my point of view and that of those around me. It does not mean everyone thinks the same as me, but I can tell you that I do seem to be part of a majority where I come from regarding our views of America.

I don't know many people who think America is the devil, or that all Americans are this or that. However, most people I know feel worried, bemused, shocked, pity and yes, a hint of schadenfreude regarding the USA.

I know it will be very hard to believe as most of you clearly think otherwise, but to many of us, what is happening in your country (it being a developed democracy and not an authoritarian regime) is truly unfathomable. The attitudes, speech and actions of your government are concerning to say the least.

But its not just that. In European democracies (note the focus there, we have problematic regimes too), you'll find it very hard to find a country where things are politicised in the way they seem to be there. From an outside point of view, it's difficult to understand. Masks for example, there are definitely debates here too (although most people would agree that right now is not the time to go against the medical consensus, most people does agree that there will have to be long and thorough studies about this situation after it is under control). However, this is not right /left matter at all. Both sides seem to genuinely hate each other there. 

Then its the matter of the type of right /left in the country. I lived in England for a long time which I thought (perhaps wrongfully) that it would be the closest European country to the USA. Our (mainstream) right wing is so so so left of yours that it's difficult to conceptualise in some matters. And they are really not particularly left wing from our point of view. Really, no-one would ever say the tory party is left wing in a million years, and yet they are in some policies closer to your Democrats. 

In any case, all this to say, I get it, it might seem that we don't get you. But that's because, even though in some aspects we are similar, we really don't get you. Our mainstream (again, the word mainstream is important) cultures are so completely different in that regard. Its not a conspiracy theory or the soyboy brigade, it's genuine differences.

7540,j4h3rq,Reddit is literally 99.99% leftist fucks unfortunately. I basically don‚Äôt comment on anything anymore. Even the minimalistic hobby subs are filled with people that argue to death as soon as you have a slightly different opinion.
7541,j4h3rq,This can't be anymore accurate. It's so sick. I really had enjoyed reddit but wtffff !!? The hate for America every sub literally finds a ways to post about Trump or anti police etc....You get attacked even for basic questions on posts or clips.

7543,j4h3rq,"So I've read a bunch of responses here, some in good faith, some less so, but I haven't really seen anyone hit the mark. 

It's not that complicated. I'll try to help by sharing my perspective, which isn't exactly the broad reddit perspective you're mentioning, but of course everyone is different.

Many Americans of a certain age were raised being told that America is the greatest country in the world and that if you work hard, you'll be rewarded. We are great because we let the free market work and competition is a naturally balancing force. The American Dream! (A simplification, but you all know this concept as well, I'm sure).

At the same time, we gained access to communication and information at a rate greater than any other generation before us. The internet connected people, brought news to us instantly, and we could share our experiences with the world. 

We learned, through observation, that despite being ""The Greatest Country in the World"" America has a much lower quality of life than many other developed nations. We pollute more, education is more expensive (and more necessary for survival), healthcare is unaffordable and inaccessible, and we work more than other nations without receiving any of the benefits. 

But we're a democracy! We can change it if we get involved! Except within our two party system, the solutions to these problems aren't really represented in our politics. Our system prioritizes controversial topics like gun control and abortion, while quietly making sure corporate and special interests are well taken care of. The cost of college (let alone housing) isn't even on the table (this isn't an issue of party, both major parties do this)! 

It's become apparent that while we may be the richest country in the world, that doesn't mean we're the best off. And in my lifetime, we've been having this exact same conversation for decades and literally nothing has been done about it. 

So we see countries with stronger social programs, better safety nets, and mandatory worker protections and we feel a bit of resentment at how we've been treated. 

It's clear that the issue isn't a matter of money, but a matter of political will, to fix these problems. 

So... Yeah. We tend to run a bit left of center. Because conservative ideology has no solutions for these problems and instead seems to be intent on blaming us for having them at all (an oversimplification, I know, but there does tend to be a bit of resentment there).

Heard the stories about how American travellers would wear Canadian flag pins on their gear because they‚Äôd get treated poorly otherwise.  This was even long before 9/11.  But the wars following 9/11 exacerbated the disdain the world felt towards America.  

I think the rest of the world views Americans as ignorant, arrogant and self-Centered.  I‚Äôm not personally anti-American, but I will say that in general, Americans have no idea how the world views them.  They don‚Äôt get much information that isn‚Äôt America-centric.  Every once in a while they find out that they‚Äôre disliked and they seem surprised, but it‚Äôs not new.

Fine, don't like every single thing about the U.S. But stuff like mocking the virus response despite we are doing very well with it and irrationally hating everything related to Trump, and really even conservative values, is insane. Any subreddit not specifically dedicated to typical right-wing ideas range from neutral to aggressively left. Try bringing up facts defending Trump, guns, or the U.S Covid response, or bringing up facts that trash the left, such as how socialized healthcare is bad or how guns don't increase murders. You might find a couple right-wing people, but most will be left wing to a decent degree."
7616,j4h3rq,"Australian here. I've been to the US a few times on holiday, and every time enjoyed myself, great place to visit. 

Here are some things that I find odd about you lot, although some of these have been from interacting with your tourists.

Assuming that non Americans know or have heard of your state/city. I was in Fiji, and an American tourist asked where I was from and I explained ""Tasmania, Australia"", I then asked where they were from and received a response of Jacksonville, which for most people not from the US, could be anywhere. Just little instances of arrogance like this might be telling? That said, another bloke when I asked said ""Australia"", to which I thought ""ya, fucking obvious mate, we've got the same accent, I meant where in Australia"". So maybe I'm just being picky. 

I've also had an American ask how do we live without guns. And, well, pretty easily? Your gun culture can be quite puzzling for a lot of other countries, but Americans, or at least quite a few of them, have no idea why. As I've said, I'm from Tasmania, we've seen what a crazy person with a machine gun can do, and so changes were legislated. And Australia hasn't had a single mass shooting since (edit: I tell a lie, we've had 2, one in Darwin NT last year with 4 dead, and another in WA where a guy killed his whole family in a murder-suicide, still 2 in 24 years isn't bad). Regardless I'm not trying to convince you all for gun control, but more so point out the culture around keeping and wanting guns is seen as being odd by a quite a few of others.

Healthcare for me is probably the biggest thing I think is so odd, and view negatively of the US. The fact people have to check if they can afford to go to emergency is crazy. Is the healthcare system in Australia perfect, fuck no, is it serviceable for the majority (95%+) of the population, yes. Taxes seem to come into question for this a bit, and after a brief look and read, I think I'd be almost 10k/year better off in the US? But that was only looking at federal, I don't know how your mix of federal and state taxes works (if there is a mix?). After another extremely short google, maybe I'd only be 5k better off? It just seems odd for such an advanced and wealthy country to not have basic healthcare for all. 

Tl;dr you yanks can come off as a bit needlessly arrogant and/or loud and from time to time in a strangely uneducated way. A lot of us non-US view that as puzzling. And as per internet rules, we make fun of things we don't understand. 

That said, one of the best pro-America jokes I've heard is ""There are two types of countries on earth. Those that use metric, and those that have put people on the moon""."
7617,j4h3rq,"Simple rule... downvote stupid and baseless criticism, without commenting.

I live outside a major city, and most people don‚Äôt think America is bad. I think ALL of us see problems, even if we disagree on what those problems are... but that is true of any large topic or entity.

Not even the original Matrix movie is without its flaws."
7618,j4h3rq,"Nope. I just said look into those two things, for starters..."
7619,j4h3rq,"I think what also plays a role is: You simply cannot imagine how present and dominant media coverage of the USA is here in Europe. You used to only hear on the news what was internationally important: foreign policy decisions that affect NATO nations, a meeting between Merkel or Macron and Trump, an important event/crisis/battle involving US forces in the Middle East etc. Now the media gives Europeans constant information about the Trump presidency, BLM, the latest LGBTQ identity stuff, the latest school shooting and what have you. This is mostly irrelevant for the European John Doe but we still hear about it. This way a lot of people feel like they ""know"" what America is like and like every issue US society has is THEIR issue as well. Example: Countries like Germany or France suddenly had people protesting police violence mimicking BLM even though our police force here faces totally different challenges and has completely different issues than the USA. But to them it felt like BLM was their issue, too.

I am not American but I lived in the US for two year and I am often the only person that will take a different stance when discussing the US with friends or family. Sure, I am liberal and don't agree with many Republican ideas and policies. But I get where many Republicans are coming from and see the unique contexts of American culture. Many young Europeans seem simply unable to understand that the US is - yes, western but - another culture with other issues and other mentalities than Europe...

Tl;dr Media makes it feel like US issues are Europe's issues, Europeans judge US through European (liberal) lenses only"

A whole bunch of nonsense here where there is no context in pictures/stories, just a bunch of clowns looking for social justice! 

Today I saw a video of a kid getting beat 6-1 because a smaller kid stole his skateboard (which he took offense to), and he was going to fight him 1 v 1 (smaller kid was losing in the beginning) to get it back... Only to have 6 people jump on him and beat him. We had the peanut gallery saying how it was good as 'the bully got  beat down'... ü§®. I just thought to myself 'nope Im not having it' . 

I guess I should say a long, long, time ago in a galaxy far, far away... our Dads would tell us to fight our own battles and NEVER be the third guy in a 2 person fight. Yeah, the small guy would be roughed up a bit, but he would  have been served something he deserved, some Humble fucking pie. 

Another one, saying the Lightning celebrating their championship on a boat (with guys they were all in the bubble with), with no masks was despicable... Meanwhile, theyre with the same group of guys they have been with quarantined together for 3 months. Celebrating a HUGE accomplishment they did together, on a BOAT away from their fans! 

The last one was a senator on a plane who had his mask on his ear but off his face talking to someone on a plane, captions stating some bs that he needs to get tested and display his results for everyone... without any context as to the where, when, and how this pic was taken... 

Of course the soyboi taking the pic discreetly did it ( you can see his arm, like hes hiding the cam), without likely being a man... and calling him out on the plane where the guy could actually defend himself. 

The one that gets me the most today... is this arsehole Wallace at Fox, saying 'to put on the damn masks'... another soyboi answer... 

I have a heart condition... I wear one... but I also very much believe in freedom... and people should not be forced to do things that are negligible at best. 

Trump was trying to inspire by being brave. Its good for his economy... Kinda like another politician I loved (Jfk) being brave and going to Dallas regardless to  the reports stating they were going to get him there.

7666,j4h3rq,Yeah no way it has anything to do with relentless american imperialism and psychopathic republican policies that increase wealth inequality. Every single one of you reptile brained rednecks should be sterilized and at least 2 generations of your families should be purged from the earth

7670,j4h3rq,Well said. What I don‚Äôt know is if the problem is generational or endemic to young people throughout history. I have noticed though that gen z and millennials are completely shocked by the concept of consequences of actions.

7675,j4h3rq,"I red-pilled myself in college when I decided to research the difference between capitalism and socialism/communism. In theory, communism sounds like a great idea, but as any halfway educated person would know, there is a big difference between theory and reality. In reality communism fails to deliver, and provides even more opportunities for corruption to develop. Just reading about the USSR for a couple hours will turn most people away from the idea of communism forever. If more young people did this I think we'd see a major political shift in that age group.

I think another big contributing fact is that young people are very socially liberal, and they think that means they have to vote democrat because of that reason. Social changes are something that happen naturally over time, regardless of what political party you put in office. However, the impacts we feel after making economic changes are immediate and can literally destroy the country if we aren't careful. And it's not as if Trump is some kind of racist/homophobic asshole, he has always been supportive for every American regardless of color, sexuality, gender, etc. I've always felt that social issues have been overblown to win over naive voter's emotions."

Well this for starters this is why people dislike the US, so many people just say it's the best. Well it's not.

It ranks 8th in gdp per capita, 30th in healthcare, 45th in press freedom, 17th in economic freedom and 34.8 people per 10 million die to police shootings compared to the UKs 0.5 deaths per 10 million and that's only some statistics, there's more.

My point here is not to shit on America just to point out that it's not the greatest, as a matter of fact it ranks the 7th best overall best country in the world, switzerland being 1st."

7682,j4h3rq,"""Young and dumb"". Hmm, well if you call opening your eyes to the real world ""young and dumb"", I guess you'd have a pretty good point.

""Young people tend to have little success."" Maybe (just maybe), it might be because cost of living in the last 40 years has increased by 200%, yet wages have only gone up 50%. Maybe it's because college is insanely expensive, yet people consistently push for people to go to college instead of trade school or other career options. Maybe it's because the world is burning and corruption is everywhere, US and the world. Maybe it's because past generations screwed millenials and Gen Z's over (market crash, raising the cost of living while not raising wages, corrupt government officials, raising healthcare costs and lowering healthcare quality, to name a few). But those are just hypothetical statements, obviously. The ""greatest country"" would never be this corrupt.

> So, it becomes easy to blame their failure or stagnation on some sort of ghost ""injustice""

So when I get bullied to the point of being suicidal all because I'm a furry, that's not considered ""injustice""? When I get death threats, just because I'm a guy that likes other guys, that's not considered ""injustice""? When a 12 year old black kid in a park gets shot by the police and everyone says it's his fault, but when a 17-year old white boy illegally possesses a gun and kills 2 black people and injures more that's considered self-defense and ""Oh, he's just a little boy trying to protect himself"", is that not considered ""injustice""? Sorry, I see how you could think that these are considered normal in everyday life, but 2005 isn't 2020. I hope you can take the blindfold off soon and see the real world that isn't rainbows and unicorns.

>Give young people on Reddit a decade or two, and more than half of them will swallow the red pill

I mean, if you wanna believe that, go right ahead. I can't see into the future, but hopefully the red will eventually become less corrupt.

>ask them what country does it better, while having such a diverse population

Well, going off of the fact that the US is 76.3% white, and that we have an average diversity, I'd say quite a few (Canada and Australia are both more diverse than the US).

We need to move on and forget about our past, just like we did with the damn natives!!! You don‚Äôt see us mentioning our genocide of them anymore!!!"
7798,j4h3rq,"Right wing ideology is a disease. In America you people are so extreme that you‚Äôre bordering on ISIS and Wahhabism levels. Q anon is a mainstream republican belief, along with covid denial, climate change denial, vaccine denial etc. Definitely not a good look fellas"
7799,j4h3rq,[removed]
7800,j4h3rq,The fact that conservatives actually think this only shows that they don't understand racism or ignorance. Republicans openly court white supremacists and have basically had a party identity of racism since the 60's inherently baked in their platform.
7801,j4h3rq,"what about r/enlightenedcentrism ? I thought they were centrists until I read the comments, because the shit they made fun of was so mundane."
7802,j4h3rq,Hopefully the good part
7803,j4h3rq,Oooo do another alpha beta story please!! This time about when the president got covid.
7804,j4h3rq,Quebecker*. Lol.
7805,j4h3rq,"That's cool, you're a joke to the rest of the Canadians."
7806,j4h3rq,"Oh me too brother lol... Libs, like the dems make bleeding heart rationales that really dont make a tonne of sense. 
I want accountability. Trudeau, Prince Harry and pals have a tonne of missing money to account for and it is  swept under the rug AGAIN..."
7807,j4h3rq,i think we both sadly know who they mean when they say that. :(
7808,j4h3rq,Well it's 5 in the morning and I'm waiting for a bus. I think it's legit to use reddit. Also there are cute dogs on here. Why do you use Reddit?
7809,j4h3rq,You guys are doing a pretty good job of it
7810,j4h3rq,I'm from the continent/country/prison known as Australia.
7811,j4h3rq,"To be fair, we do that too. A lot of Americans criticizes other countries (China), without ever going there"
7812,j4h3rq,"""Foreign"" is an interesting word choice for an internet based platform..."
7813,j4h3rq,There are a lot of americans that seem to have the opinion of america being the greatest and best in the world when they've never even been outside their state
7814,j4h3rq,"You see American media?  That's all they see without actually living here.

I do agree with your first point though.  That's what a large portion of reddit is.  The others are teenagers trying to be all edgy and cool."
7815,j4h3rq,"Because it is ""cool"" to act like an edgy, ungrateful, brat."
7816,j4h3rq,"The only people I know who dislike the way things are in America are those on the Left. They  go on about how much better it would be if the U.S. were like this or that country.

But they don‚Äôt appear to have any intention of moving to said country. And ironically their favorite country probably wouldn‚Äôt take them as permanent residents without asking them to jump through some serious hoops."
7817,j4h3rq,The main reason I bring up western europe specifically is the eastern nations had the soviet tanks rolling through the streets.  They aren't pro commies.
7818,j4h3rq,"Exactly the same for me! I was suuuuupppeerrrrr conservative. Then I matured lol. I have no idea what sort of ""liberal indoctrination"" these people are referring to"
7819,j4h3rq,This is a song from 2014. I don‚Äôt care about accomplishments. I‚Äôm saying currently. Why are we the best?  What statistics now make us the best?
7820,j4h3rq,"I'm on the process to become a us citizen now.
I cannot wait till the day i can finally say that i am an American citizens (:"
7821,j4h3rq,that was essentially what you were saying if we get down to brass tacks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
7822,j4h3rq,"Yeah lol, you went from the movie Detroit Rock City (conservative religious moms trying to cancel kiss) to the democrats doing it instead."
7823,j4h3rq,"Good thing slaveowners weren't racist then. Phew. I thought they raped Black women because they no value for their life. But now I know, White men put their dicks in something to let them know they care. Wait till sexually abused children hear about this! Such amazing logic you construed."
7824,j4h3rq,"Well my post wasn't about trying to solve our differences in America.
It was mosty to ask why reddit has gotten so hateful towards America lately. It wasn't like this not too long ago."
7825,j4h3rq,We do in Australia.
7826,j4h3rq,Okay you've got my attention. What makes you say that about Bush and the towers? I'm honestly curious since I was in middle school when 9/11 happened.
7827,j4h3rq,Communist democrats? What you mean?
7828,j4h3rq,That‚Äôs good news
7829,j4h3rq,"There are a lot of people in LGBT community who are very toxic. (Like a lot when you look into it) I feel myself belonging to the group but most of us just hate the attitude of ""White/Heterosexual bad"" don't worry there is a lot of us who don't like it beeing thrown around for forced acceptance, but what has been going on for past few days isn't about promoting homosexuality rn just about a post which blew up about making fun of the term ""proud boys"" by posting male homosexual couples tagging or calling it proud boys. Wait a week or few and it'll be gone.

Also the amount of hypocrisy you could see from some people (not all) in LGBT community is disgusting, people being harrased for being too hetero or being kicked out/banned for not agreeing with things like ""this group of people must die/we need to lock them up"" like ffs I cannot even describe how much I started hating the toxic part of that community they are only spreadung the bad part of us.

That being said sometimes I think people overract when seeing things ""being thrown at them"", because I've seen people being harrased a lot for just being a couple and in one case a man being beaten up for kissing his boyfriend."
7830,j4h3rq,Hey this means you have something against gay people. No one ever talks about heterosexuality being thrown in their face.
7831,j4h3rq,"I have Hawaiian shirts, plate carriers, and ""assault"" rifles so according to the left on reddit, I'm a racist homophobe. My BIL is gay, one of my uncles is gay. I get along great with both of them , we go hunting and shit. Neither of their personalities revolve entirely around their sexual orientation and neither of them have a victim complex. My best friends are a black guy, a half Japanese guy, and a Jew. We all sit around, smoke weed, and talk politics/religion/history/philosophy without any issues. It's almost like individual people are the problem and not any specific group/race/religion/nationality/sexual orientation/political leaning."
7832,j4h3rq,"the problem is that I see a lot of conservatives (not necessarily you) who claim that someone's gayness is thrown in their face by super normal things, like a couple kissing in public, or a character in a TV show being gay and that being mentioned, or shit like that. it seems to me that a lot of conservatives only accept gay people when they keep it hidden publicly."

8016,gvf2rj,I understand we play the 'contrarian' attitude to whatever our opponents are feelings. But...we dont have to all the time. We can be willing to admit there are problems.
8017,gvf2rj,But he didn‚Äôt commit a violent crime...
8018,gvf2rj,[removed]
8019,gvf2rj,Source?
8020,gvf2rj,Ok. How many blacks/whites are killed during NON-VIOLENT arrests?
8021,gvf2rj,"Such a stupid ass take. No one's denying law enforcement has a difficult job that may, on occasion, result in death and injury. The point is that law enforcement officials have been getting away with callous and almost hateful murder of it's citizenry and specifically the black population for far too long."
8022,gvf2rj,"How about:

1) how many other cops have as many complaints against them and are still cops? 

2) who reviewed all of these complaints against this cop and decided he could still be a cop?

3) were any of these complaints ever brought to the attention of the mayor or DA? If so, hold them accountable at the ballot.

4) these complaints should be reviewed by a committee that includes citizen representation.

If you really want to fix the system, start asking these kinds of questions of every mayor, chief of police and DA in every district and precinct across the nation. Keep asking until you get acceptable answers. This would be far more effective than protesting or rioting."
8023,gvf2rj,Police brutality doesn't just encompass killings. There are endless videos of black people being brutally beaten by police while not resisting in any way. None of us should be supporting authoritarian violence against any race.
8024,gvf2rj,"Another thought to add:

I'd figure that the arrest rates for African Americans are higher than it is for white people. They could have more deaths total but significantly more arrests which would be even worse.

Edit: I should proof read my spelling..."
8025,gvf2rj,"Jesus, this topic has been researched and studied for decades with tons of data collected. To pretend it's just a myth is literally part of the problem

8026,gvf2rj,Yes but we don‚Äôt now what the black people did and what the white people did. It‚Äôs not a matter of fact how many gets killed it‚Äôs why
8027,gvf2rj,"Far too many people brigading this thread think this is some sort of attack on black people, as if they are being blamed or demonized.

I think the vast majority here recognize that black people disproportionately suffer from socioeconomic issues due to racism and other reasons. They are targeted for petty crime, frisked more often, and put away for charges other people may not be convicted of. Our horrendous prison system destroys their life, and puts them in contact with hardened criminals.

But that doesn't change the fact that police killings are directly proportionate to violent crime. For whatever reason, police killings are a color-blind issue, everyone should be equally pissed off. Trying to frame it by saying, ""I'm tired of hearing of black people die."" just comes off as ignorant. You are hearing of black people die for the same reason you hear about car chases - they draw in views."
8028,gvf2rj,Where are the statistics for this clam
8029,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8030,gvf2rj,Does this make cops less bad ?
8031,gvf2rj,"George Floyd wasn't committing a crime, he tried to cash a $20 check and was then slowly choked to death for 8 minutes"
8032,gvf2rj,"Truth is 99% perception and 1% facts. add on top most people just want quick and easy answers to complex problems, this will always give you delusional responses.Americans don't really know what they asking for in these protest, they just know there's a problem and they want it fixed with the easiest and quickest solution. and of course that's never going to work, and most likely make to problem worse or move the problem elsewhere. but they keep fighting for it none the less."
8033,gvf2rj,What‚Äôs truly sad about all this rioting is that it‚Äôs minority communities that are being destroyed and most likely will never rise up again
8034,gvf2rj,This kind of stuff is pushing me away from the party. This is plain ignorance that I cannot stand behind. Goodbye.
8035,gvf2rj,So the problem is: A lot of people are cops that shouldn't be?
8036,gvf2rj,"Jesus, what about sample size? Aren't black people only 13% of the population?"
8037,gvf2rj,But my emotions!
8038,gvf2rj,What about non-violent
8039,gvf2rj,Y‚Äôall know data can be modified with it still be technically true right? There is a reason he didn‚Äôt post for all crime not just violent.
8040,gvf2rj,"What the rioters are doing now, no police for has done or can do. They say they are for the people yet they are the ones affecting more minorities than any law enforcement"
8041,gvf2rj,"Despite the fact that African Americans commit 50% of the crime they only make up 30% of those killed by police, which means the police are less likely to use lethal force on African Americans."
8042,gvf2rj,They dont care about police brutality at these protests. I was there.
8043,gvf2rj,"Well there‚Äôs way more whites people than black people.  The statistic I‚Äôve seen the most is that black peoples are killed by police at 3 times the rate white peoples are.
Any amount of people being killed by the police is too much if you ask me.  The state shouldn‚Äôt be executing its citizens in the street like that."
8044,gvf2rj,Right but I think the issue is arrests and deaths for non-violent crimes.
8045,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8046,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8047,gvf2rj,"I think the point is this was a non-violent criminal he just tried to cash a bad check and got busted he wasn‚Äôt fighting.  He was probably desperate to feed his family likes lot of people right now.

I wouldn‚Äôt post stuff like this it makes conservatives look unsympathetic... the elites want us to be divided and this plays right into their hands... I know ‚Äúbut it was posted by a black man‚Äù... do you personally know that guy who posted on Twitter?  

Can you be sure that‚Äôs not propaganda that we‚Äôre helping them to spread just because it angers us to be called racists when we‚Äôre actually not?  

Well if we‚Äôre actually not racist then let‚Äôs just give the moment of solidarity that the situation deserves and leave it alone.  The fact is color is just another way to divide us we‚Äôre all Americans.  We lost an AMERICAN the other day who was brutally murdered by the people who were sworn to protect him.  

I‚Äôm fucking pissed and I ain‚Äôt even black.

It‚Äôs okay to think that a police officer did the wrong thing, and it‚Äôs also okay at the same time to think that not all cops are crooked like that.

Why do we have to be on one side or the other?

Not all white people are racists, just like not all black people are racist.  And not all cops are racists either.  But there are bad apples in every group that make the rest look bad as they try to fit us all into stereotypes.

Let‚Äôs give the guy solidarity and not stoke the fires anymore... who benefits from a race war?  

Certainly not the people battling each other, divided we fall."
8048,gvf2rj,Whatsu the numbers on nonviolent crimes?
8049,gvf2rj,"For those that want the data, here it is at the bottom of this paper. I highly recommend reading the entire paper. This man proves there is no racial injustice in America as the left is so willing to throw out. Also, keep in mind this is from  Roland G. Fryer, Jr.  a Black American at Harvard.

Also, the FBI website has the statistics."
8050,gvf2rj,Wonder why BLM doesn‚Äôt protest black on black crime. Oh wait they think black on black crime is cause by white people
8051,gvf2rj,"70% of the country is white while blacks only make up 13%, while it looks like whites are being killed more often, in reality the smaller pop is being decimated by these violent acts"
8052,gvf2rj,"There's a lot of back and forth on that thread, his sources actually aren't very good, one of them actually states that they were counted at under half the reality, as lots of precincts don't report the killings. Some people on there also cited other sources on there that said that black people get killed disproportionately more, but this is probably due to the disproportionate amount of crimes they commit. It seems like there are sources that show both sides being correct, so it's hard to really work out what's true and what to believe."
8053,gvf2rj,Tit for tat... that‚Äôs how I see it!
8054,gvf2rj,"I think this country has a serious problem with systemic violence and institutionalized thuggery. We have come to expect and accept it, and that's part of the problem. Shut the riots down."

8080,gvf2rj,"This means nothing without context. If you have 1000 black people arrested and 4 of them killed during the process against 2 whites arrested with 1 of them killed, you can brag that 50% of white people are killed during their interpellation against 0,4% from the  black community. It's bs but the numbers are correct. The demographic perspective is also  necessary: if 12 people die out of a community of 15 persons when 30 persons die out of a community of 300000, the second one is a tragedy that may reveals some problems inside its society, the first one is a genocide."

8083,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8084,gvf2rj,When were we talking about VIOLENT crimes?
8085,gvf2rj,If black people are arrested more frequently for violent crime than whites it would both account for this statistic and be evidence of pervasive policing bias. This one fact by itself isn‚Äôt really enough to prove anything though it does provoke interesting conversation. Also where is this stat from? Jc
8086,gvf2rj,It‚Äôs not just about racism. It‚Äôs about the institutionalized police state. Black cops have abused the power to white civilians too. It‚Äôs not just racial but also an issue of police having zero accountability
8087,gvf2rj,"Simple explanation, only look at the numbers for when the murdered was not peaceful and then also add the people killed not during an arrests (again while peaceful) and then you will see the bias.

Don‚Äôt quote me but Tamar was killed for being ‚Äúarmed‚Äù however the same did not apply to Kaitlyn. I hope everyone is doing okay x"
8089,gvf2rj,"Yea but also per capita isn‚Äôt taken into account, is it?"
8090,gvf2rj,Is it not clear that what's missing here is the number of African Americans arrested for non violent crimes that are killed. That's the hidden number here.
8091,gvf2rj,"How is it possible?

It's a statistic not per 10,000 violent crimes, it's not even per 10,000 people arrested. The statistic is # people killed per 10,000 arrests.

If 1,000 people are arrested 10 times. That'd be 30 killed per person arrested.

If one group commits 2 crimes per arrest and the other commits 3 crimes per arrest, that's enough to offset the difference.

What is the actual truth? Difficult to say without the numbers. But, there is ample evidence that blacks are targeted for arrest at a far greater rate than whites.

Additionally, it's not only violent criminals that are shot. For those two years, 5.9% of whites killed were unarmed, while 8.4% of blacks killed were unarmed."
8092,gvf2rj,How many more 10s of thousands of black people are arrested over whites though?
8093,gvf2rj,"Yes and black Americans make up 13% of the population. All killing is bad, but there is a bias against black Americans, which has been the case for a while now..

Anyone who wants a source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/"
8094,gvf2rj,Do you guys not see that white people make up 70% of the crime and blacks make up like 29%. So by my math shouldn‚Äôt be that more whites should be killed by cops seeing how many crimes they commit.
8095,gvf2rj,Fake asshole!!!
8096,gvf2rj,"1. This small selected statistic (without citation of real data by the way), asking ‚Äúhow‚Äù is an argument based upon weak foundation. There are countless other statistics that would indicate that the system is racially biased towards African Americans.

How many white people were publicly lynched for jogging down a neighborhood minding their own business? How many unarmed white people were shot 42 time in front of their own homes by ‚Äúaccident‚Äù?
8103,gvf2rj,"No because it‚Äôs not a helpful statistic.

It doesn‚Äôt take into account the rate at which people are killed, there are way more white peoples in America then black, so if you control for the population sizes black peoples are definitely killed at a much higher rate.

That‚Äôs the facts, but why that happens and what should be done about it is up to you."
8104,gvf2rj,Agreed.

8107,gvf2rj,"There isn't a race problem though, there is a cultural problem in the black community. Why do black males who are a low number minority commit the overwhelmingly majority of crimes in the US? Racism isn't making them commit crimes, so why would that be the case? We are ignoring the underlying factors and blaming it all on racism."
8108,gvf2rj,"There is a problem, and I think it is more of a  prejudice against the culture low income creates.

I just watched the Epstein story on Netflix and clearly this man had Millionare Privledge. So too do whites have white privilege, which is a racist way of saying that if you work hard you are placed at an advantage that money brings.

By and large the singular problem the black community is facing is poverty. And that is not because of some generational disadvantage as some claim. There have been countless ethnic groups who have come here completely broke and made something of themselves including Cubans, Italians, Haitians, Greeks, ect.. Their poverty in my opinion is culturally rooted. One just needs to look at what happened to the economy of South Africa after apartheid was lifted and the blacks took over. The GDP is typically 60% to 80% of its historic average. Enough said."
8109,gvf2rj,"Sure there are problems.  There are 800,000 police officers in the US.  If 5% of them are bad actors, that's 40,000 bad cops.  That's going to show up in a lot of bad acts.  But it does not prove a case that our criminal justice system is racist."
8110,gvf2rj,"Yes and the issue is police violence. Creating an us vs them racial narrative on who gets stepped on by the police is not productive in my opinion. Would this be a news story if the cop was black? Probably. Would it start riots across the country? I dont know if it would stir up as much rage. 

About 200 black people are killed by the police every year. About 800 people of other races are killed by the police every year. By framing this as issue of systemic racism it tends to create more racialized political movements. When in reality, the police killing 1000 people every year is ridiculous. There needs to be steps taken to reduce police violence across the board not just in the black communities. But it fits a nice narrative and allows race hustlers on all sides to use race as a wedge issue to maintain their power creating a further racial divide and preventing reform in the police conduct."
8111,gvf2rj,"Also, if we solve policing problems off of these protests, we all benefit. Reforms will be colorblind and not just about the people who get killed."

8113,gvf2rj,"I dont believe some shitty cops making a shitty arrest is ever justification for rioting and so on. Sorry, I wont play nice guy with you."
8114,gvf2rj,"Violent crime doesn't equal justified death. Ideally, the number of police shootings would be 0.

It is just an indication of frequency and intensity of police encounters, used to understand that larger trends we are having a national debate over. A much better indicator than skin color is, at least."
8115,gvf2rj,"True, I wonder how this scales for all arrests. Also I'd love to see the data source"
8116,gvf2rj,The protests ceased being about one case a long time ago.
8117,gvf2rj,"This just in, if you commit any crime, cops tend to show up.  Maybe next time people will admit they were wrong in commiting the crime and just do what the cops say when they are being arrested.  This doesn't excuse the cops actions and all four deserve the worst punishment, but George's actions also led up to this conclusion, not just the cops."

8124,gvf2rj,This. It‚Äôs not a matter of how many are killed it‚Äôs a matter of why they were killed
8125,gvf2rj,"This. This. This. 

This tweet/post are not the point of BLM or any of these protests at all. 

It‚Äôs a stand against tyranny, oppression, and actions without consequences."
8126,gvf2rj,"The BLM movement is specifically saying that black Americans are targeted by law enforcement and killed in higher number than other ethnicities. Crime statistics prove this is simply inaccurate no matter how strongly it is perceived. Obviously law enforcement needs to be changed. However, so does the BLM message if they want unity and support from other ethnicities who are suffering along side them. It is a fight that needs to be fought together."
8127,gvf2rj,YES. It‚Äôs not a matter of how many but why.
8128,gvf2rj,"Yes and same goes for white victims of brutality as well. There are plenty of videos showcasing this too so why is this entire thing about race then? All of you like to hop in here and say it‚Äôs not about race and the media is overblowing but that‚Äôs not what people I know in social media or the video footage of protests indicate. This entire protest has almost instantly become a virtue signaling mess that has lost its entire purpose and has devolved into noting more than an opportunists dream. Sadly there are people protesting peacefully which is their right and I‚Äôm fine with that, but democratic leaders have done absolutely nothing to preserve the peace and have actively allowed the true message to become lost. Shit like this happens and then they wonder why trump was elected"
8129,gvf2rj,You'd probably want to control for crime reports.  Eg. arrests per reported crime
8130,gvf2rj,"Are you saying arrests of innocent black people or just arrests total. I have no problem with a disparity in total arrests as long as it isn't innocent people being put away. If white people commit more crimes, more white people should be arrested. If black people commit more crimes, more black people should be arrested."
8131,gvf2rj,"Further looking at the numbers here:

White Americans are not killed by police at the same rate as black Americans are, even though roughly twice as many white Americans are killed. Specifically, 2.9 white Americans are killed per million and 6.6 black Americans are killed per million. Now, there are MANY different factors contributing to this number. Somewhat contrary to the rhetoric right now, all races have the same chance of being killed by the police per police interaction. Per police interaction is the key point here.

Why this is, is explained by the increased amount of police interactions that black Americans have compared to white Americans. This is because, as a % of population, more black Americans live in poverty and at a lower income. One of the single biggest contributors to crime rates is the income level of the surrounding area. Higher income means less crime.

8133,gvf2rj,"In a way, I agree with you. 
It's definitely a class issue masquerading as a race issue. But, to some cops, if they see a random black male on the road, it's seen as an opportunity to harass them - because they assume it to be a poor helpless guy who couldn't get back at him. The issue is lack of accountability. 
But it's also stemming from the bias against black people. 
So, it definitely has racial tone to it. Denying that is trying to be smugly ignorant."

8137,gvf2rj,"No all it does it re-frame the debate a bit. It's evidence that the number of deaths by police isn't racially motivated. It says nothing about the overall bias against black people by the police or the brutal methods that the police use against all races. 

Regardless of the racial motivation of the deaths, the police aren't acting justly with anybody and that needs to change. I'm a middle class white man who grew up poor and I've been a victim myself. Police have carte-blanch to lie, be violent, and ruin people's lives and that needs to change."
8138,gvf2rj,"The initial crime plus resisting arrest are both crimes. In the initial viral video, you can hear some of the bystanders telling george to stop resisting and get in the car. 

He still should not have died regardless of what he did or did not do because there should be better protocols for assisting officers to maintain awareness of detained persons health. But he definitely resisted arrest."
8139,gvf2rj,Glad you can name one. Doesn‚Äôt make it a statistically relevant issue.
8140,gvf2rj,Statistics are ignorance?
8141,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8142,gvf2rj,"Yes and also there is an inadequate system in place to penalize the bad ones. 
For example in a hypothetical department of 100 cops, there is one bad cop, and he/she is harassing the black community, there has to be internal checks and balances to punish the bad cop in case of something like this. At that point everyone world acknowledge that it's that one bad cop. But, is the department protects the one bad cop, public would start to think it's 100 bad cops. And they are unheard. And rightfully so."
8143,gvf2rj,"So isn‚Äôt that what the 10,000 is for?  I haven‚Äôt slept in a long time so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I am completely wrong, but wouldn‚Äôt comparing the data for every 10,000 white people committing a crime and every 10,000 black people committing a crime give pretty accurate data?"
8144,gvf2rj,Yes. Also commit 50% of crime.
8145,gvf2rj,Yes they are only 13% but that doesn‚Äôt matter because they took 10000 from each. Not the full amount. So it‚Äôs still the same comparison
8146,gvf2rj,Just anarchists taking an opportunity to commit arson
8147,gvf2rj,Which is why the numbers are per capita you idiot
8148,gvf2rj,"That makes no sense, they send their resources where the crime is.  What facts do they have regarding there being just as much crime in white neighborhoods other than wishful thinking.  

If you have a problem that is significantly worse in one area you don‚Äôt distribute resources because of equity, you‚Äôd end up with more victims in the area that needed it and cops twiddling their thumbs in areas that aren‚Äôt dangerous.  

I looked at homicide statistics In St. Louis this year.  14 of the suspects are black, 1 is a white female.  Do they recommend we waste resources searching for random white guys too so we can have equity?  On the BOLO should they be instructed to pull over a few white guys to pad the numbers while the real perpetrator passes them by?  What is their suggestion for policing to achieve ‚Äúequity‚Äù?"
8149,gvf2rj,"There is nothing progressive or conservative about wanting justice when justice is due. Police brutality, racial bias, and unjust murders should not happen.

With that said, that doesn't mean the person you are talking about can't be misguided. Crime is just one factor that is easily understood. Virtually every conceivable measure paints the same picture. For instance, if you were to only look at homicide rates... you would have to argue that the police are pinning murders on black men without a dead body, or ignoring murders if white people committed them. Maybe it happens occasionally, especially with rich people, but on a level that is statistically significant? Unlikely.

This is why the most popular way to measure it right now is the CDC's death by assault numbers by race. It obviously isn't bulletproof, but it does the job of showing trends of violence, free from police bias. 

Regardless of how you look at it, if you are measuring criminality or violence in any way, you will find that it is a much more reliable correlation than skin color."
8150,gvf2rj,"My argument supports your buddy that Black communities have been targeted for over-policing and socio-economic disenfranchisement. 
Nixon‚Äôs [War on Drugs](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-shocking-story-behind-nixons-declaration-of-a-war-on-drugs-on-this-day-in-1971-that-targeted-blacks-and-anti-war-activists/)  arguably established over-policing as the norm, with the direct purpose of arresting, incarcerating, and generally disrupting Black folks and their communities; it worked very well.

I also argue that Black folks are more likely to be arrested not only because of over-policing, but because encounters with police[tend to be more invasive](https://sociology.columbian.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs1986/f/downloads/Weitzer%20%26%20Brunson%202015%20.pdf)  than the encounters of white or Hispanic people. This means more opportunities for the police to institute a search and find something arrestable or use force and claim resistance, etc. [This study](https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2580&context=faculty_scholarship) found that ‚Äúminority citizens in the 1990s were disproportionately stopped, frisked and searched at rates significantly higher than would be predicted by their race-specific crime rates, and that this excess enforcement was explained by the social structure of predominantly minority neighborhoods than by either their disorder or their crime rates. In the decade since the first study on OMP, stop rates have increased by 500 percent while crime rates have remained low and stable.‚Äù

My final thought is that even IF Black folks were committing objectively more crime than white folks, I cannot possibly imagine that they, at a bit over 10% of the nation, are committing the 40, 50, 60% of all crime I see claimed.

I could probably keep going but it‚Äôs late. I think it‚Äôs important to educate people (many in this thread) who believe that there‚Äôs an inherent defecit in Black communities that leads to objectively more crime, more violence, and weaker moral code than in other races. Studies have been conducted for decades showing that the problem is an institution that skews itself against Black folks, rather than Black folks actually being as shitty as many people like to think. And add to that the centuries of our government limiting their rights, keeping them poor, giving them poorer educations, protecting those who violate them, giving them harsher sentences in court, and refusing to budge on necessary change until something finally erupted. The problems Black folks are facing don‚Äôt exist in a bubble, and they didn‚Äôt just sprout out of nowhere; there‚Äôs a vast historical context that is necessary to understand the whole picture."
8151,gvf2rj,"But this comparison, if true, is eliminating that by using per capita numbers. 

If you look at 10,000 white arrests and compare them to 10,000 black arrests for similar crimes, more white people are killed. Total population has nothing to do with these numbers."
8152,gvf2rj,"This is a topic because every time protests come up, black people are bearing their cross while the other races are expected to sit back and support them in solidarity. 

The only thing people are trying to justify is their frustration at being told to be quiet because they don't suffer like the black man. Police killings are an issue that affects everyone on a relatively equal level, and it is only misguided perception that shows otherwise. To be crass about it, anti-brutality efforts are being sabotaged by an indeterminate number of black people who care more about being the biggest victims than actually solving the issues people face. For real change to happen, their misinformation needs to be silenced."

8158,gvf2rj,"of course they have, they are a much larger portion of the population, this isn't really a good argument. What's better is to look at the amount that have been killed by police per million, that gives you a much better look at the proportional difference. It's much higher for black people than white people, however black people also commit a much higher amount of violent crimes, including murder, per million than white people do, which can explain the disparity in police killings."
8159,gvf2rj,"And those officers go to jail? People are simply asking for these officers to be held accountable who commit these acts, ffs."
8160,gvf2rj,And also blacks are a tenth of population. Whites are overwhelmed majority. It's like saying there are more number of people dying in China everyday than USA - which is true. Because the population is much bigger there
8161,gvf2rj,"> Because most of the cases of black people killed by police were in cases where either they were being charged with a nonviolent crime

That is pretty hard to believe, considering only 9 of the 223 black victims of police killings last year were unarmed. Did you mean most of the cases the media goes crazy over?"

8173,gvf2rj,"Holy shit, he actually linked sources. Love this post"
8174,gvf2rj,There are sources in a reply to that tweet^^^
8175,gvf2rj,"I just checked his sources and he must got the math wrong a white person when arrested for a violent crime has a 0.115%chance of being killed and a black person has a 0.156% chance so it is 1.35 times as lightly for a black person to be killed than a white person for a violent crime. 

And that's with his statistics so idk what he did for that maths.

His last source says 454 white people were killed and 229 black people. They also state that 392562 white people were arrested and 146734 black people for violent crime. If you then divide and times by one hundred to get a percentage 45400/392562=0.115% for white and 22900/146734 = 0.156% for blacks.

Then to work out the increased chance you just divide one by the other 0.156/0.115=1.3565 hence there is a 1.3565 times higher chance for a black person to be killed than a white person for the same crime.

Also if you look at the stats they provided almost 1/3 of people of all races were fleeing the scene and idk about you but running away doesn't justify getting killed to me."
8176,gvf2rj,"Showing a comparison of total population to deaths by police shootings isn‚Äôt entirely accurate because it doesn‚Äôt account for the fact that black people (statistically, I‚Äôm not trying to make a racial statement) commit disproportionately more crime.

I watch a lot of live PD and it sure seems like most of their calls that involve drugs and guns are im minority neighborhoods.  The color of one's skin has no bearing on one's character but the reality is that ghetto culture is pretty at odds with the police so of course they're going to clash.

&#x200B;

"" I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection. ""

I dont know if I consider myself a white moderate, but a lot of this spoke to me. When he said **""more devoted to ""order"" than to justice""**, that got my attention because that was/is me. He used the words **""prefers a negative peace""**. Man, that is powerful! I can't tell you how many times I have said something on my social media about not wanting tension (in so many different words or others). And then this part **""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""**.That is so MANY people right now including myself.

The man said **""SHALLOW understanding from people of good will""** (you know, all those, *I want black people to be treated equally* BUT, people)

Listen, Im not trying to change your viewpoint here at all. I am just saying we can all be healthier and smarter if we take the teeniest bit of self reflection.  


Edit: I would like to add this..**."" I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.

8208,gvf2rj,"I think the protests partially stopped being about George Floyd‚Äôs murder when we witnessed people getting attacked by police for exercising their right to protest and journalists getting pepper sprayed for no reason.

This is kinda my understanding, like yeah we are still protesting about his murder but we‚Äôve added on all these other grievances"
8209,gvf2rj,No it‚Äôs not saying that they are killed more it‚Äôs saying that the reason why they are killed is unjust.
8210,gvf2rj,"Wrong. Statistics say they are in fact targeted.

And the BLM message is in fact unity. It is just corrupted by a lot of media."
8211,gvf2rj,More black people are killed while peaceful
8212,gvf2rj,I'd assume arrests total as that would inflate the number therefore deflating the number of deaths per arrests. It's just a theory though.
8213,gvf2rj,Great analysis. Thanks for this!
8214,gvf2rj,Its also washingtonpost...
8215,gvf2rj,Glad someone said it
8216,gvf2rj,"Of course. There is an overwhelming perception of bias against black men. It isn't well quantified or controlled for, but it is significant enough that I and many others believe strongly that most officers have a bias.

But that is a different discussion. Killing and bullying are two separate things - as can be seen by many of the slogans and complaints being centered on death, rather than just brutality. We see right now what happens when an unarmed black man is killed and the officer is caught by witnesses. How often do you see national news and unified outrage about unarmed white men being killed by police? It happens over twice as often, so you would expect at least one or two of those to be horrific executions.

Point being: Police know and fear the consequences of killing black men, but not the consequences of brutalizing and bullying them. At least, that is my theory."
8217,gvf2rj,"And what are cops actually defending in this case? Their killer partners! If I had to beat random people to defend my killer co-worker  I would've quit that job immediately. If most of them are really good cops, then they should join the protesters, and I'm pretty certain that there won't be any violence. We've seen some videos of cops kneeling down, and nobody ever attacked them. But instead everyone cheered! But what happens when protesters are kneeling down? They get beaten up and arrested! 

And if cops join the protesters,  and there is still looting, they can go together and beat the shit out and arrest looters! 

It's so simple, but there is no intention from cops side. They would rather just follow orders. Or it might be that most of them are sociopaths who enjoy violence. There is no other explanation."
8218,gvf2rj,"I don't live in USA. I'm from Europe. But seeing how cops have been acting in these protests... yes, in my opinion that is a strong reason to tear down your institutions, because for you it might be nothing, but seeing your friends beaten up for no reason, shot with rubber bullets, teae gaa bombs in the face. I'm agains looting businesses though. But institutions? Yeah! I mean if you *want* to see, you have a lot of proof around, which shows how cops are abusing their power, how they always are the initiators to start  beating protesters. Cops also have attacked journalists, random citizens etc etc. You may say but there are violent protesters as well. Yes there are, but you rarely see cops to attack looters. Now all of this is happening in front of cameras. Imagine what they have done when there wasn't any camera around these past 20 years.  In my opinion the whole 'police system' in USA needs to be reformed. And I'm really happy that people finally woke up!"
8219,gvf2rj,And your argument is that resisting arrest is punishable by death?!
8220,gvf2rj,[No.](https://www.statista.com/chart/21872/map-of-police-violence-against-black-americans/)
8221,gvf2rj,"Oh no! Someone disagrees with you! 


(For a good reason)"
8222,gvf2rj,Vote Justin Amash!!!
8223,gvf2rj,"Not really. Statistically black offenders commit 50% of all **murders** in the US. Total number of crimes is hard to determine because conviction rates are often determined by poverty of the suspect. 

This is a pretty good analysis of the issue:

https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-black-americans-commit-crime

And for a contrary opinion, though they never actually address the statistics...

https://www.splcenter.org/20180614/biggest-lie-white-supremacist-propaganda-playbook-unraveling-truth-about-%E2%80%98black-white-crime"
8224,gvf2rj,"... because racist officers wrongly (sometimes) convict or exaggerate.  (Let me stress this, not all the time!)"
8225,gvf2rj,Thats at night. During the day its peaceful and pretends to be egalitarian and organically organized.
8226,gvf2rj,"I have never seen (and if you have proof of it please bring it to the forefront) an instance of where any other race, creed, or color has been killed by the police and Black people say nuhuh whataboutus. If anything I see the exact opposite. What I do see ALL THE TIME is you guys don't have it that bad. ""See in this one group of numbers they kill  one more white person that you. So your entire argument is irrelevant."""
8227,gvf2rj,How do you figure that?
8228,gvf2rj,If you have 100 white men and 4 out of every 10 are killed But you have 20 black men and 3 out of every 10 are killed that‚Äôs a very different statistic. Black Men would be dying at a far more alarming rat. So my statistics matter because they are in direct and scientific opposition to what is being perpetuated by this tweet.
8229,gvf2rj,"My logic is math. 

You remember the thing we all learned in school."
8230,gvf2rj,"I mean cases in which no crime had been committed or the crime was very minor. George Floyd was suspected of having written a bad check for $20. He was restrained and following all commands. There was no reason he should have been killed. Also I find it interesting you didn‚Äôt site sources for your numbers. And even if the killings of unarmed black people by police are in the minority, the amount should be zero"
8231,gvf2rj,"The point

Your head"
8232,gvf2rj,"they are not the same, one is a toy!!!!!!!!!"
8233,gvf2rj,"I want to have an open conversation, I‚Äôm open to your thoughts. Go into detail if u have the time. I‚Äôm not here to lionize anyone. I respect you and want more people to understand that the right aren‚Äôt like how the media can portray them to be. My ears are open for anyone who is willing to speak with me ‚ô•Ô∏è"
8234,gvf2rj,I‚Äôm still confused. What does per capita have to do with deaths sustained from police officers? I‚Äôm genuinely curios and am looking for help to understand.
8235,gvf2rj,"1. ‚ÄúKiller‚Äù what about the other complicit officers who cooperated in killing George Floyd?

2. The point is that there are these systemic issues and there is opportunity to drive real change to address these issues when there is attention on them."
8236,gvf2rj,"White = 459/5319654=0.0000862838

Black = 223/2115381=0.00010541836

More black people are killed according to the sources he cites. I have no idea how he came up with his number but he had to WORK to make it fit his narrative."
8237,gvf2rj,The person who he's pulling that data from says that he is misinterpreting the data.
8238,gvf2rj,"Even more specifically, the statistic references people _arrested_ for a violent crime.  There are racial differences in crime rates, neighborhood police presence, arrest rates, and prosecutorial discretion.

This statistic (3 vs 4 of 10,000) attempts to control for crime rates.  If police shootings have zero racial bias and are precipitated only by the severity of the interaction, then the discrepancy would mean either that white people are more likely to act in a way that forces police to shoot them, or that black people are more likely to be arrested for lesser violent crimes.

What I'd be really interested to see is rate of shootings controlled by number of interactions with the police and some measure of the severity of those interactions."
8239,gvf2rj,"Eh, not really.  The original tweet just gives the breakdown based on a specific subset.   If it had used the number of (deaths per race) per number of *total* violent crimes committed, then it would have given the likelihood of being killed in an encounter based on race."
8240,gvf2rj,"Yeah I understand that. That‚Äôs one of the only comparisons I could find, unfortunately."
8241,gvf2rj,"They are charged with more crimes per capita, not they commit more crimes. Commit implies guilt and the argument is that many of the convictions for black people are falsified or unjust, especially in cases where lethal force is used. Black people are stopped more often, with less than probable cause and charged more frequently than whote counterparts exhibiting the same behavior."
8242,gvf2rj,"If I'm reading the the linked article correctly, the assumption is that in a fair system, the percentage of blacks killed by police per state and the percentage of blacks per state population would be fairly close.  The map seems to show that there is an issue with police officers disproportionately killing blacks in some states.  But again, this assumes that any difference between these two numbers is only because of race, and not any other factor.  What could be more illuminating is comparing the percentage of violent crimes committed by blacks to the percentage of blacks killed by police for violent crimes.  Unfortunately, neither Hoysauce2's article nor the OP's linked tweet provide this information."
8243,gvf2rj,"Jeez I'm stupid.   Yes, it is per 10,000.

Will delete my comment."
8244,gvf2rj,It doesnt.
8245,gvf2rj,"Great question!

Blacks make up !4% of our population, so crimes against them should be 86% lower per capita, right?"
8246,gvf2rj,"It matters because it provides a basis from which the two data sets can be compared to.  From the data provided, there is no way to link the numbers provided to the number of deaths to number of *total*  violent crimes commited."
8247,gvf2rj,"I‚Äôll agree with you on this one. I raised my son as a single mom and I will tell you, there is no substitute for a stable, moral father-figure in the home. We‚Äôve lost that in our culture, regardless of race. And society is suffering."
8248,gvf2rj,"Left leaning here. I am hopeful for some actual discussion to broaden my own understanding, and skimming this thread has given me some hope for that. I do actually agree with the principle of this statement. While I don't think that children *necessarily* have to be raised in a two parent (and necessarily heterosexual) family to have a good upbringing, I believe that it does correlate with having two parents in a stable relationship. However this valuable relationship is easier for people who already have more financial stability, and more difficult for those already in poverty. Essentially, working-class and poverty-line marriages are more fragile. Thus it becomes a sort of vicious loop, where poor parents are less stable resulting in children who will grow up both with less money to begin with, and a troubled upbringing which may affect character. All this drastically limits upward mobility.

This is where race comes into play, where centuries of heavy systemic racism like slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, etc. have pushed black communities into poverty, and its associated consequences which I described above. Jumping forward to today: even if, hypothetically, racism is completely erased (which I would argue even the institutionalized variant is not), the results of centuries of systemic racism are not suddenly reversed because the racism itself is gone. Black people would still be in poverty because of past racism, and likely would stay in poverty for much, much longer because of poverty's vicious loop.

How to address this is a completely different issue.

tldr; people born into poverty tend to stay in poverty. black people have been historically suppressed into poverty, so now they will tend to stay in poverty."
8249,gvf2rj,"There needs to be a push right now among black leaders to work on themselves as well. Society can't just magically fix their problems, and nothing is going to get better unless there's some serious change."
8250,gvf2rj,"I have been preaching this for a long time. The increase in the rate of African Americans being thrown in jail, which started a few decades ago, is around the same time many women in the african American community was left to raise multiple children in a one parent household. There isn‚Äôt any institutionalized racism against them. Cops arnt out trying to just beat up black people. Yes cops may profile african americans a bit differently but what do you expect when a race in america that only makes up 12% of the population os responsible for over 50% of the violent crimes in america. Until people can start taking responsibility and raising their kids right... this trend is not going to change. The poverty levels are not going to change. Its not the government trying to keep them in ghettos, it is themselves keeping them there"
8251,gvf2rj,So all the government programs that make it monetarily advantageous for the father to leave the mother are bad? Who could have guessed?
8252,gvf2rj,Well to make an assertion you have to prove it right first
8253,gvf2rj,Cultural instability caused by racism of the past not giving well paying jobs to minorities and having communities force non whites out. This leads to today‚Äôs adults being raised by parents that were poor due to institutional racism.
8254,gvf2rj,"That's a nice sentiment. But we are perfectly comfortable with the tension King says is good. We are all ready and waiting for people to step up, but they have to make the decision. We can throw as much money at schools as we want but if parents don't step up and actually sit down with their kids and provide a stable place to do homework, then the kids won't succeed. And poor or not, people can make those choices and can better their situations. When you look at the crime statistics it is staggering, and I'm not talking about petty crime, I'm talking violent crime. It seems like there as so many unwilling to do what needs to be done.

When you are depressed and downtrodden, at some point you have to just say you're going to make a change and make it. That true on an individual level and on a societal level. We have put so much money into the situation, and when they've asked for more, we gave them more, we give away free college in New York now. We made new laws, during the crack epidemic they asked for harsher sentences to try and stop the problem, then 15 years later we get called racist for it. We've given them more police when they asked for it, they try to clean things up, the community doesn't back them up, they refused to snitch on violent criminals and thiefs, so the cops couldn't do their jobs well, then things don't change so they get upset we haven't done enough.

And the saddest thing is there are so many awesome black Americans who pushed and succeeded and they truly feel like peers. But then you have this other group that feels this malaise and never seem to push. What are we supposed to do? Really?

What does BLM want? How in the hell can I undo my privilege if it even exists? If there is a job a black person and I are competing for, should I stand aside? I have a family I need to fend for, I have other people I need to think about. So what should I do?"
8255,gvf2rj,"This is good, really good. Thank you for sharing."
8256,gvf2rj,"Letter from a Birmingham Jail. I also read it this week when my daughter presented it to me. It also changed my mind somewhat. I absolutely agree that non-blacks need to act also. I agree with him that now is the time to make the changes that we need. There will never be a convenient time and direct action is how we need to proceed. It does not good to mull over the causes of the issue when we can start on the solution now.

With that said and with my wholehearted agreement, the direct action that we take and condone says a lot about ourselves. Direct action without violence is what King believe in and I think he's absolutely right. I support the protests and if I could be there, I'd be protesting too. It's not only our right to petition our government for a redress of grievances, but our responsibility to support those who have a legitimate grievance. If you think that destroying property, stealing, and beating people who disagree with you peacefully, you (the individual) have lost all of my support and it's now my duty to call you out and support justice in calling for your arrest and recompense."
8257,gvf2rj,"Did he plagiarize most of his writings? He plagiarized a lot of them. An investigation conducted by Boston University, where King got his Ph.D. in theology, determined that he had appropriated roughly a third of his doctoral thesis from a dissertation written three years earlier by another graduate student. Curiously, the same faculty member had been ‚Äúfirst reader‚Äù of both theses, leading some to wonder whether King‚Äôs faculty advisers at BU were incompetent or just guilty white liberals who gave a promising young black leader a pass. King also ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù portions of many other writings and speeches, including the famous ‚ÄúI have a dream‚Äù speech he gave at the 1963 civil rights rally in Washington.


My favorite MLK quote is from the recordings the FBI used to extort him. King could be heard saying to a man identified as Abernathy, ‚ÄúCome on over here, you big black motherfucker, and let me suck your dick.‚Äù 


What a guy."
8258,gvf2rj,What are your views on the current situation? How much do you attribute the current problems of blacks to the police and how much do you attribute to a general culture
8259,gvf2rj,"I agree the prison system is horrid, it doesn't rehabilitate people but rather produces more criminality than there already was.  But that still isn't a valid reason on why black males commit more crimes than anyone else.  It really goes back to the break down of the traditional family and like 85% of black children are raised in fatherless homes.  Statistically speaking, a fatherless home is the greatest indicator of poverty later in life.  If you look at some major leftist policies after world war 2 that led to the break down of the African American family, we can really see devastating results by the 70s where the families broke down and the crime rates went up.  The curves are almost an inverse of each other.  Regardless of income, a fatherless home produces more often than not, a less functioning person in society.  That's just human nature, we thrive when both a mother and father is present.   I am not saying that racism doesn't exist, but it is such a small factor and people have held on to that victim mentality for far too long.  As we stand today, every man has the same opportunities and we need to teach solid family values and self reliance again."
8260,gvf2rj,Exactly. Finally a comment that is real and not victim blaming. Racial profiling is very real. They are targeted therefore get caught more. Plus the whole not being able to afford bail. White people sure do commit a whole bunch of crimes. So do black people. In fact people commit crimes.
8261,gvf2rj,Black men are responsible for 43% of police deaths. Is that because white people who shoot cops aren‚Äôt charged?
8262,gvf2rj,Oh yea thats still happening...lol  Quit living in the past.
8263,gvf2rj,"As an Asian person, stop using us as your model minority.  We ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù because of abusive parental tactics to pressure us into doing well in school.  And don‚Äôt even try comparing our plight to those of black people.  We didn‚Äôt have decades of American slavery pushing us down for generations."
8264,gvf2rj,"In fact I don't remember hearing Asians protesting about being a minority or unfairness.   I've worked with many, and they are hard workers, not blamers.  And they're very successful here (especially in information technology field, look at silicon Valley, MSFT, etc).   Good for them, good for us all."
8265,gvf2rj,"Imagine thinking that the amount of wealth someone has makes them better or worse, as you do."
8266,gvf2rj,"Wrong the data doesnt point to blacks getting worse treatment from police. 

Write your prose elsewhere.


If you're saying here these people are attempting a revolution then I expect we can treat it as such. Go ahead and br explicit it, is it a revolution?"
8267,gvf2rj,This is context to the incomplete statistic you just provided. Long haul truckers are more likely to get into wrecks. People who partake in violent crime are more likely to have deadly encounters with police.
8268,gvf2rj,Armed Robbery did nothing wrong.
8269,gvf2rj,"lol, not true but ok"
8270,gvf2rj,I literally just said those cops deserve the worst punishment. can you read?...lol
8271,gvf2rj,"Where? Later in the thread? If so, then that‚Äôs what should have been posted here. I was replying to to this post, and this post misses the mark."
8272,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8273,gvf2rj,"Thank you for the request, comrade.

u/FranticTyping has not said the N-word."
8274,gvf2rj,"Absolutely, I agree. 

It‚Äôs still going to go down as ‚ÄúResponse to George Floyd death‚Äù on Wikipedia but it‚Äôs tough to say these protests haven‚Äôt pivoted."
8275,gvf2rj,"And no other ethnicity has unjust killings by the police? What about the young man ruthlessly gunned down by officer Bradford? Understanding that we are all being oppressed by a bloated, poorly trained and unaccounted for police force is the first step to creating true change."
8276,gvf2rj,"Yeah I screenshotted a thing they had on Snapchat like a month ago that said by June US coronavirus cases would be up to 200,000 new cases daily, and 3,000 deaths daily, yesterday i compared the numbers and for the final day of May, there were like 20,000 new cases, and 600 new deaths.  It still sucks, but not nearly what they were projecting it was going to be.  Washington Post is not reliable at all."
8277,gvf2rj,I agree with this.
8278,gvf2rj,"Did you read the second half of my comment? 

I will reiterate. He should be alive. The cop killed him for no reason. The man was restrained. Aid should have been provided. My point was to correct you. George did break the law including resisting arrest, which you glossed over and said he wasnt committing a crime. Again to clarify, George fought the police. The cop killed him unjustly."
8279,gvf2rj,"And is there a reason you think comparing per capita numbers on this is better than per police interaction or per violent crime? The fact is, when you isolate race as a variable, racial discrepancies in police killings go away."
8280,gvf2rj,When a group of people only makes up 12% of the total US population but causes over 50% of the violent crimes in America... those numbers will be skewed by per capita because of the increase in number of police interactions. If you took the numbers on a per police interaction.... they are more comparable. It eliminates unneeded variables.
8281,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8282,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8283,gvf2rj,">I have never seen (and if you have proof of it please bring it to the forefront) an instance of where any other race, creed, or color has been killed by the police and Black people say nuhuh whataboutus.

Because no other race riots or protests... The media doesn't bother hamming up deaths and inciting rage because they know nothing will happen.

 I'm speaking of the protests as they stand now - any attempt to make it an issue about police brutality instead of an issue about skin color is met with vehement denial and scathing vitriol. Putting those people in their place opens up the possibility of a much more significant dialogue on the issues Americans face when interacting with the police."
8284,gvf2rj,"No, black men are being arrested for violent crimes at a far more alarming rate, but still being killed at a lower percentage than white men."
8285,gvf2rj,"No, I understood what you were trying to say. I just disagree with it. The protests aren‚Äôt about non-violent offenders. They are about black offenders. 

Non-violent doesn‚Äôt truly fit here anyway as video shows Floyd struggling with police, first when they take him out of his vehicle, and next after they already put him in a police car. He ended up on the ground because he struggled with police after he was safely in the car.

That doesn‚Äôt excuse the response by any means. But you also can‚Äôt call Floyd truly non-violent since he struggled and resisted."
8286,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8287,gvf2rj,I understand. I picked Tamar Rice‚Äôs story because it was just a toy. To help demonstrate a racial disparity. He was fatally shot for having that toy in contrast to her being permitted to bring an actual gun.
8288,gvf2rj,"So OP took 10,000 people that are both black and white each, then found evidence stating how 4 in 10,000 whites are killed, while 3 in 10,000 blacks are killed. Taking such concrete numbers makes data more presentable."
8289,gvf2rj,"More black people proportionately to overall population size, but less black people using the flat numbers. You could argue that you should use the proportional numbers, but that assumes no other variables like the number of police interaction with each race being different."
8290,gvf2rj,"I don't know how much WORK it is to read nine lines down from the numbers you are using, but yes he did.

He also said as much when he cited violent crime instead of all crime."
8291,gvf2rj,"Yes. Also, importantly, what about those killed before an arrest is even made?

Not to mention how these numbers correlate to relative percentage of population? Income/status?"
8292,gvf2rj,that difference is so statistically insignificant... we are talking less than 2 hundred thou of a difference.
8293,gvf2rj,Doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs still true. This study was concluded by an African American professor at Harvard.
8294,gvf2rj,"""The person he's pulling the data from""? The FBI and CDC...?

Don't believe everything you read on the internet, kids."
8295,gvf2rj,? Can you go into more details? Sauce?
8296,gvf2rj,Your right the stats in question don't account for a few different thing like non violent crime and drug charges.
8297,gvf2rj,"He is misrepresenting it, this data is irrelevant because it doesnt talk about whether the people were armed"
8298,gvf2rj,I was referring to the link hoysauce provided. The link compared total racial population to death while the statistic provided in the original compared total encounters by race to deaths.
8299,gvf2rj,"That‚Äôs fine, I just wanted to clarify the difference."
8300,gvf2rj,"I disagree with that notion, you can‚Äôt say black people are more likely to be convicted without committing a crime because it implies that America is so racist that it would allow 13% of the civilian population to represent %50 of the prison population. Isn‚Äôt it more likely that black people just happen to break the law more often? Finding actual statistical evidence to support this is difficult because we generally assume that if you are in prison you are most likely guilty, however there is evidence to support that black people don‚Äôt just represent more of the prison population, but also commit crime that. For example [this article by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/21/nyregion/study-suggests-racial-gap-in-speeding-in-new-jersey.html) no less, shows clearly that black drivers in New Jersey (couldn‚Äôt find anything more general) are more likely to break road laws and therefore get pulled over more often. And according to [this](https://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/survey-analysis/demographics) study, black and Hispanic people are disproportionately more likely to be involved in gangs. I don‚Äôt see the evidence that black people are just walking around getting falsely accused. Of course, this isn‚Äôt a race issue, it‚Äôs a culture issue, and currently black American culture idolizes gang and drug activity."
8301,gvf2rj,It would be better to do number killed per police encounter.
8302,gvf2rj,"But also the comparison of non-violent crimes, it could be argued that non-violent crimes shouldn‚Äôt be open violent recourse (but there‚Äôs obviously grey area in there). George Floyd was being charged with using counter fit money, so he wouldn‚Äôt fall within that measure.

Edit also I‚Äôm not sure what the classification for Justine rascyzck would be, but would come under the same problem, she walked to a cop car, spooked them and then was shot. She hadnt committed a violent crime, but was killed by police."
8303,gvf2rj,"If anything, I‚Äôm seeing it start to switch. It‚Äôs going to take awhile, but I see a lot of African American single dads and stable homes, and a lot of white families that are single mothers, dad split. 

Maybe in a generation or two we might have an opposite problem."
8304,gvf2rj,"No argument with much of your statements, And I‚Äôd add (minimally) financially rewarding single women having babies out of wedlock was intentionally done to undermine black families. It‚Äôs cruel and horrifying what the US government set out to do and has been successful at. These single parent families are kept very poor and also punished if they try to break out of being in the welfare system by losing benefits at a faster rate than they can earn to replace. This plan was intentional, and started under Lyndon Johnson."
8305,gvf2rj,"Yes and it doesn't help that the senteces are long. 7 out of 10 inmates will be eventually released and half will be back. After a long sentence it will be difficult to adjust to ""normal"". This is a huge problem in a country with 2.2million incarcerated. With that number we can only imagine the amount of kids growing up without a dad. If i remember correctly most drug addicts never had a dad around. (Shockingly all my friends who turned to drugs never had a dad around.) That creates problems, but you do you."
8306,gvf2rj,"Iirc the reason more African American dads found themselves in prison during the Clinton era was related to the introduction of private prison companies? So from that I feel like maybe it is partially the govts fault for creating a generation of single black mothers that were unable to raise kids as effectively as a stable two parent home would. Just thinking off the top of my head here, please lmk if I‚Äôm wrong!"
8307,gvf2rj,Sure. Easy...having a baby out of wedlock at a young age (under 21) results in 98% of women in instant and long term poverty.
8308,gvf2rj,"I appreciate your response because I can tell it is something you truly feel strongly about. 

I can‚Äôt answer any of the questions unfortunately but did want to let you know I enjoyed reading your insight. 

Enjoy your evening."

8311,gvf2rj,"Does it really matter? The issue at hand is police brutality and it's not just blacks that are on the receiving end of it. However, it is mostly blacks that live in fear of the police, even if they've done no wrong. The brutal tactics need to end. Everybody should live without fear of their government's agents ruining their lives or giving them a beating without any hope for justice."
8312,gvf2rj,"Even if you look at it from that perspective (which some civil right leaders do take that angle) it‚Äôs still a symptom/caused/exacerbated by the prison industrial complex. 1/3 African American males will be incarcerated at some point of their lives. This obviously tears families a part when somebody goes to jail. So once again, jail is at the very LEAST exacerbating the problem you‚Äôre talking about. Additionally, like I said, biased policing/enforcing and biased charging also affects who‚Äôs actually imprisoned for crimes. For example, [these graphs ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/%3foutputType=amp) show how African Americans are disproportionately arrested for marijuana offenses. Despite using at similar rates. Like I said, biased policing is part of the reason for your statistic."
8313,gvf2rj,I agree with everything you say but that ‚Äúevery man has the same opportunities‚Äù. Because I think it would be fair to assume that most of the people born to families who live in wealthy areas have more lucrative opportunities than most of the people born in poor areas. Regardless of skin color or country.
8314,gvf2rj,"Again, it‚Äôs likely due to biased patrolling/policing. It‚Äôs a commonly known fact that in cities, minority neighborhoods are often patrolled more aggressively than other areas. Additionally the use of force and searches are more often used on people of color, just look at stop and frisk statistics. This means that there‚Äôs a lot more interaction between cops and people of color, some of them starting fairly hostile. So it would make sense that they‚Äôre also disproportionately involved in police deaths if police harass people of color more."
8315,gvf2rj,"It is.

8317,gvf2rj,So you're blaming black people?

8319,gvf2rj,"Notice how I never mentioned a revolution or racial data in my statement. That's not my argument. But if you want to change the scope of conversation, sure let's do it.

Is it a revolution? Depends on your definition. If you think of it as ""forcible overthrow of a government or social order, in favor of a new system"", most certainly no this is not a revolution. If you think of it as ""a dramatic and wide-reaching change in the way something works or is organized or in people's ideas about it"", then yes it has the potential to be a revolution.

And on the data aspect, I'm inclined to totally ignore that portion because something tells me no matter what I say/link/show, you're not likely to change your thoughts. I unfortunately expect none of the below will really matter in that case:

[The source of the data in the OP lists it as incomplete](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides)

[The WaPo article linked in the OP tweet states the FBI undercounted fatal police shootings by half](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/)

Now that we've found the data in the original post to be unreliable at best, we can take a look at actual stats such as:

[This Yale research paper finding that blacks and hispanics are 50% more likely to experience force used by police](https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/workshop/leo/leo16_fryer.pdf)

[This Northwestern University research article finding that black men are the most likely to be killed by police](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793)

[This research paper from the National Violent Death Reporting System finding that victims of death at the hands of police are disproportionately black, despite being less likely of being armed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/)

[Or this report by the Department of Justice finding that ""African Americans are more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops even after controlling for non-race based variables such as the reason the vehicle stop was initiated, but are found in possession of contraband 26% less often than white drivers, suggesting officers are impermissibly considering race as a factor when determining whether to search. African Americans are more likely to be cited and arrested following a stop regardless of why the stop was initiated and are more likely to receive multiple citations during a single incident""](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf)"

8321,gvf2rj,Can you?  He was SUSPECTED of using a counterfeit bill. You are talking like he was already proven guilty.  You're not even acknowledging he might have been innocent.
8322,gvf2rj,He explains that every police death (right or wrong) they count as a violent suspect
8323,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8324,gvf2rj,Yes. Police brutality = bad. This movement is just focusing on Black suppression.
8325,gvf2rj,"And again, your argument is flawed. Did we watch the same video of George Floyd on the ground while he was choked to death in broad daylight for 8 minutes. The only thing he was fighting was for his life"
8326,gvf2rj,I‚Äôm not going to stand with a party that won‚Äôt kneel with its people.
8327,gvf2rj,"If you want to ignore the problem, then you are the problem.                        
Edit: one of the people replying to me definitely bought the account. Over 30,000 karma but no posts and barely any comments."
8328,gvf2rj,"So you don't want us to protest when police murder us and get off. Just shut up like everyone else, and wait for change to come?"
8329,gvf2rj,"That‚Äôs because white men committing crimes don‚Äôt get caught because their white. 40% of white male cops are wife beaters. They aren‚Äôt going to arrest themselves. White cops in Chicago work with gangs and profit on the side while gangs do their dirty work. 
White men have looted more money and killed more people in their history than every black person combined. So stop standing up for racism because it makes you uncomfortable that my generation and the ones below me don‚Äôt want to be wage slaves and beating sticks for powerful rich white men anymore."
8330,gvf2rj,"They literally can't afford to kill every black man they arrest over some bullshit. With whites only the really dangerous ones get in trouble to begin with.

Any more racist questions, racist?"
8331,gvf2rj,That implication is not my intention. But thanks for your honest opinion
8332,gvf2rj,"Ah so its the ""shoot if you are unsure"" ideology?"
8333,gvf2rj,"Kaitlyn Bennet had a slung rifle where it was legally allowed, Tamir Rice was playing with an unholstered, extremely realistic looking toy pistol in public.

Should the officers have used better tactics, such as parking further away and cautiously approaching? Yes.

Could the shooting of Tamir Rice been avoided completely if the Officers went about it in a more strategically sound way? Yes.

Does that make these two situations comparable? No."
8334,gvf2rj,that doesn't make sense.
8335,gvf2rj,isn't it kind of interesting that so many more black people die from non-violent crime police interactions? So much so that it negates the lead that while people had for violent crime related deaths?
8336,gvf2rj,"Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what I was to confused about, what‚Äôs he trying to say"
8337,gvf2rj,True but the FBI don't have the full picture because police departments are not obligated to hand over this data.
8338,gvf2rj,"He himself didn't pull the data from those sources, he used   the 60 minutes/Washington Post correspondent's information who used the FBI and CDC as sources."
8339,gvf2rj,"If you read the Twitter comments about 5 threads down is a verified user. He works for 60 minutes and says that he's the source for the data.

https://mobile.twitter.com/WesleyLowery"
8340,gvf2rj,"Also, all of the killings that people have protested have not been violent criminals. Their alleged crimes don't even warrant a 10 year sentence for the ones they claim have been criminals. Or they were just minding their own business."
8341,gvf2rj,"I don‚Äôt blame you, I tried making that clear in my original post but I guess I mis worded it"
8342,gvf2rj,"I don‚Äôt blame you, I tried to make it present in my original post, but I guess I failed to do so."
8343,gvf2rj,Well this is the definition of racism then. Believing someone is more likely to be a criminal because of their race.
8344,gvf2rj,"I agree, \*just wanted to point out\* that the OP's tweet doesn't give enough information to make a meaningful comparison, much less a meaningful interpretation of said comparison.

Edited for format and clarity."
8345,gvf2rj,That‚Äôs intentional
8346,gvf2rj,"I won't comment on specific intent, but even well meaning programs can have very negative effects. The government has to be very careful in how money is given out, especially if they're on a limited budget in the first place. Directly rewarding certain behavior will almost always make room for exploitation and adverse behaviors, even rewarding marriage. IMO rewarding pursuit of education is the primary direction we should be headed in, but there are many other debates on that.

Also, I don't frequent this sub a lot but from what I've seen its a million times more civil than r/conservative so kudos, I don't know what I expected haha."
8347,gvf2rj,"How would private prisons be the reason more black people are in prison?  Maybe the reason they stay there longer?

I would assume it had something to do with the war on drugs, which IIRC, did have some racist shit tied in with how it was carried out back when."
8348,gvf2rj,"So how do we help them stay out of poverty? Birth control, education, jobs that allow them to also raise children, affordable child care. These are things our communities need to provide."
8349,gvf2rj,"What???? 98% dude come on, let's be a little scientific."
8350,gvf2rj,"That's nice but it's is frustrating that you can't answer. And this isn't about my feelings, this is about reason. I will do what I can, but there are no straight answers. What can I actually do? You can't answer. Neither can BLM. Neither can all the white folks who post pleasant sentiments on facebook saying they stand with BLM. They say we need to speak up when racism happens. WE DO. But we also don't call everything racism when it isn't. We have no idea if the Floyd incident was racially motivated whatsoever. So I can't call it racist, but I'll sure as hell call it wrong and I have. I can't lie. I can't look at the statistics and say ""Welp, all of that is racism..."". OJ Simpson got off, Barack Obama became president, white people love and respect many black people and regard them as some of our heroes. WHERE IS THE RACISM?

They say they want more police accountability. Done, we have body cams now. People in m town cried out for a police accountability board. Guess what that is going to do? Nothing. It has no teeth right now, and when it does have teeth, you know what's going to happen? A cop who did nothing wrong is going to be canned because of the perception. That isn't justice.

So we have all these people that have no real answers. It seems like there are no answers. It seems like everyone knows what has to happen, and that is simply that people need to step up and work to better their own lives.

It seems like everyone WANTS there to be an answer, they express heartfelt stories about their grandparents being shunned for being an interracial couple back in the 50's. I hear some legitimate stories once in a while, but most of the stories I hear from black people these days about racism are just a few looks at shops or something, some of which might be entirely in their heads. And when I was a teen, people looked at me like I might steal from them, too.

You conveniently leave when the questions come but that is the absolute most important part. WHAT CAN I DO?????"
8351,gvf2rj,Your a jerk. I said they feel like equals and you shit on that? Get out of here with your attempts to make people out to be racist.
8352,gvf2rj,"BLM is a front. They are being used. I will stand up for justice for any person, black or white. I will not align with a group that has questionable motives and isn't clear about what they are fighting for."
8353,gvf2rj,black students and liberals are pushing for segregation again...lol
8354,gvf2rj,"I'm not blaming period. Why does someone need to be blamed?  If I said Germans were fine engineers and very punctual, would that be racist or would I be blaming them for something?"
8355,gvf2rj,"If your mind equates this to mean whites are better, and not simply that there was a measurable change and difference like I meant it, then please take the credit yourself and don't try to cast your prejudice onto me, racist."
8356,gvf2rj,"None of those studies that that fit your wishful thinking prove the matters as undeserved. Same reasoning as the idiots with the wage gap myth.

And if it is an revolution, it can be handled as one."
8357,gvf2rj,"I don't disagree with your stance on a proportion of cops being bad people. That is obviously true.

My point is, if we can't use violent crime as context for why black people are killed disproportionately to their population percentage, then how do we explain why almost every single victim is male? I don't think anyone one would claim that police are inherently sexist against men. There's clearly a lot more at play than the immutable characteristics of the victims."
8358,gvf2rj,"Once again, not what it says here, and that also doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Breonna Taylor was sleeping in her bed when cops incorrectly entered her apartment. George Floyd was (falsely) accused of using a fake $20 bill. How are they ‚Äúviolent suspects‚Äù?"
8359,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8360,gvf2rj,Lol you‚Äôre so dumb you can‚Äôt even answer his question
8361,gvf2rj,"Yes we did. The video were the witnesses were telling george at the beginning to stop resisting arrest and get in the cop car. Again I will reiterate that the cop is in the wrong here. George should still be alive. I am saying that before the video starts George was resisting arrest and getting violent, which is a crime. The video starts after the cops have restrained him. That does not excuse what the cop did and George should still be alive."
8362,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8363,gvf2rj,Strawman - you have to first believe there is a problem.
8364,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8365,gvf2rj,Nothing I said indicates that. Police brutality is an issue that must change.
8366,gvf2rj,"Again, nothing to do with the point of the tweet."
8367,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8368,gvf2rj,"I can understand if she was given explicit permission to bring her rifle. However I don‚Äôt fully understand why the two cannot be further analyzed for comparison. His gun looked realistic, in that case wouldn‚Äôt he still be protected by the 2nd amendment? If she also had that protection he should as well. Of course unless she got permission prior to actually bringing it. Which I could see being the case. Also thank you for responding I appreciate your perspective"
8369,gvf2rj,How does that not make sense?
8370,gvf2rj,"That isn't how it works, no. Only 9 of the black men were unarmed last year. That doesn't negate anything."
8371,gvf2rj,"...On shootings. Which is why he used the washington post's Fatal Force numbers, which are far more accurate."
8372,gvf2rj,"...You realize this is just math, right? You go into each of his links, grab two numbers, and do some division. You can do it right now with two minutes of work, and several people in this thread have done so."
8373,gvf2rj,The github one? Or the one above?
8374,gvf2rj,"That‚Äôs not his point though. He‚Äôs suggesting that, if police perceive black people as more violent, they‚Äôd be more likely to end up killing them. But for 10,000 violent *black* criminals arrested, 3 are killed, whereas for every 10,000 *white* criminals arrested, 4 are killed. Whether or not the 3-4 people killed are themselves violent is irrelevant to his argument."
8375,gvf2rj,"I made it a point at the end that it isn‚Äôt a race issue, it‚Äôs a culture issue. I‚Äôm saying as an actual, statistical fact, that black people commit disproportionately more crime. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre black, I‚Äôm saying that according to the data, black people simply do commit more crime. I don‚Äôt immediately assume someone‚Äôs a criminal because they‚Äôre black and I don‚Äôt believe any race is superior to another, Im just saying that the notion that black people represent more of the prison population for no other reason than that they‚Äôre black is fundamentally false."
8376,gvf2rj,Or...how about this. Fucking law enforcement needs some kind of reform. All colors of people are killed by cops but the fucking media always makes it a racist issue. Fuck the MEDIA!!!
8377,gvf2rj,"I‚Äôll admit my views are heavily influenced by personal experiences. I‚Äôm related to several sets of people who‚Äôve participated in ‚Äúgenerational welfare‚Äù so Ive seen up close how growing up inside extreme poverty, dysfunction, and a sense of entitlement harms children. I was 13 when Nixon stepped down so my cynicism runs deep. I do completely agree that education is ultimately the most important factor in people being to rise from poverty. While neither my husband or I have a college degree, we both went to school continuously while working to improve skills. We‚Äôre moderately financially successful as a result."
8378,gvf2rj,"There was a boom in the number of incarcerations that syncs up with the introduction and spread of privatized prisons. I agree it also had to do w the war on drugs. Either way, I do believe that these things pulled black men away from their families at a disproportionate rate."
8379,gvf2rj,"Historically, the most effective method was community and culture. Shame the women endlessly for having sex with a man who wouldn't commit(slut), shame a man endlessly for not staying behind to raise his kid(deadbeat). Put value in the next generation, and do everything in your power to help them succeed.

Giving handouts has only ever been shown to exasperate the problem, but I guess there is a first time for everything."
8380,gvf2rj,So where‚Äôs the money coming from? I‚Äôll wait.
8381,gvf2rj,fatherless homes are the number factor in future poverty.  Thats statistically true.
8382,gvf2rj,"Dude, I‚Äôm there with you. I genuinely don‚Äôt know. I am definitely not an expert in all thing politics or race relations. 

A company I worked for in the past used to service government housing. After being in dozens of these places and seeing how they lived (yes, they were a majority African American), part of me just grew numb to listening to their plight. Willingly living in complete filth. Seeing kids being raised that way. But I eventually realized that It doesn‚Äôt represent every person like that. Just in my small little piece of town, it was like that here. 

I don‚Äôt know what you can do. I don‚Äôt know what I can do. Part of me wanted to donate to the NAACP today. I don‚Äôt know if that would do anything though. I don‚Äôt know just as much as you."
8383,gvf2rj,"So many people want others to change for them, to fit their ideal of how life should be. But don‚Äôt we first have to change ourself? How different would this world be if instead of the time and energy people spent complaining, protesting, destroying property and people around them, how about if everyone started with spending that time on improving themselves and their immediate family. Not worrying about what everyone else was doing, but doing what they could to better themself as a person. 

It seems to me that those people, regardless of race, that do this are the most successful in life overall. I know for me, when I get so caught up in the negativity and worrying about what‚Äôs going on around me, it distracts me from the good that I have within me. And my true ability to help others. I have to help myself before I can be of service to my community. 

And to answer your question, what can you do? Probably nothing. I need to keep reminding myself that or I get so too caught up in it all."
8384,gvf2rj,"I say help your neighbors. Don't be afraid to use your voice to help others better themselves. Fight against the voices, including the voices of those you are helping, that say they can't. It's a long process that will most likely take generations. But it's about changing culture and individuals believes. The hardest things to change. Because there will be a point when institutional racism is completely flushed out. And you said it in your comment. People will have to step up and better themselves and their communities."
8385,gvf2rj,"Even if that is true, what is stopping you from putting your own group together and protesting Floyd‚Äôs death? You asked what you can do."
8386,gvf2rj,"If the conversation is about a minorities struggle to be accepted in the U.S. and you say ""well this minority never had issues! I've know many who work extremely hard."". That statement implies the reason they have no issues is because they work hard and if a minority has issues it's because they don't."
8387,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8388,gvf2rj,"OK first you said that ""the data doesn't point to blacks getting worse treatment from police"" - now that I've proved that wrong you're (yet again) moving the goalposts of the conversation.

Now you've piqued my interest... Let's focus on one of the studies above (even though I know you didn't go through any of them).

If the Department of Justice finds that African Americans are 2x as likely to be pulled over & searched, even after controlling for everything non-race related, how is that wishful thinking? Even when they control for the same thing, they have contraband 26% less of the time.

Let me rephrase it for you: ""Group A is 26% less likely to be guilty than Group B, yet Group A is suspected/searched of said crimes over 100% more than Group B."" How would you explain Group A is ""deserving"" of this?

Edit: The DOJ also found, based off of this, ""a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct... that violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and federal statutory law."" The fact that you have the gall to dispute this information based on your perception of reality is appalling. ESPECIALLY when you claim to be a part of a group that holds these values sacred.

Edit 2: I‚Äôm also a bit unnerved at your wording, ‚Äúnone of those studies prove the matters as undeserved.‚Äù Last time I checked, we have a right to trial and individuals are innocent until proven guilty. Are you saying you do not stand by the fundamental right to presumption of innocence?"
8389,gvf2rj,They are not. But that's how they are counted in the system
8390,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8391,gvf2rj,"If I‚Äôm a barometer for a lot of other moderate conservatives November won‚Äôt be good for the party. This is a movement everyone should be behind. We can agree on the destruction being bad, but I‚Äôm not letting that cloud the root of the protest for me."
8392,gvf2rj,https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/21872/map-of-police-violence-against-black-americans/
8393,gvf2rj,Excusing racism is racism in my book. Although I changed my original comment immediately because you were not the OP (my mistake) - I feel you share the same sentiment.
8394,gvf2rj,"The Atlantic has an article about the death of Daniel Shaver a non black man who was killed by police (SWAT). You can see footage about BlackLivesMatter protesting because of his death by police brutality. 

This backs up my claim can you back up yours?"
8395,gvf2rj,Wrong.
8396,gvf2rj,Except he didnt aim the gun at the police and in all situations police are meant to warn first and give time to respond to the warning. In this case the police car pulled up super close to the kid and shot him in less than 2 seconds.
8397,gvf2rj,"Of course, civil discourse is always productive.

While the 2nd amendment applying here may be a bit difficult since Tamir Rice had a toy pistol, the difference lies in the method of carry. Legally, a rifle on a sling, not being pointed anywhere, would not be seen as threatening, however, a pistol being unholstered, in someone's hand, is threatening, as it's not really normal to carry a pistol in your hand at all times, according to these definitions, Tamir Rice was legally ""brandishing"" a pistol, which was why the original 911 call was placed."
8398,gvf2rj,"Flat numbers would never be used by someone trying to make a sound conclusion. It's like bashing South Korea for too few COVID tests because they do less than the U.S. without accounting for per capita numbers. 

It doesn't need to be argued anymore than saying I'd like my conclusion to be at least partly meaningful. 

Other variables don't come into play in making this determination. Yes. There are other variables that should be considered and can add additional context. That does not negate the absolute need to not use flat numbers."
8399,gvf2rj,"Yes, more whites die from police. But that‚Äôs because about 74% of America is white. Only about 20% of America is African American."
8400,gvf2rj," Like the math u/konsf_ksd did that you can verify yourself? I did it and got the same numbers. Explain to me how you did your math and got the same numbers but different results?

>White = 459/5319654=0.0000862838

Black = 223/2115381=0.00010541836

More black people are killed according to the sources he cites. I have no idea how he came up with his number but he had to WORK to make it fit his narrative."
8401,gvf2rj,"Sure, that makes sense. 

And then there‚Äôs also the question of whether actual violence by an individual makes racial bias less influential. Maybe police officers, on average, treat people equally during actual violent crimes. At the same time, maybe police officers, on average, are more likely to use lethal force against nonviolent non-white individuals compared to nonviolent white individuals. The stats we‚Äôre looking are also consistent with the above hypotheses, we just don‚Äôt know since it‚Äôs only correlations (i.e., they cannot tell us anything about causality).

His argument is plausible, but the stats he cited simply don‚Äôt provide proof of his claim. He‚Äôs over-interpreting what the stats are able to support."
8402,gvf2rj,How can that be irrelevant to his argument if the people we are discussing aren't violent offenders? Would they show up in data that shows violent offenders if they aren't violent offenders?
8403,gvf2rj,"Right well your putting faith in the data produced by a system which is fundamentally flawed. There are no checks and balances. These protests are about the fact that police have little to no oversight. They are protected by a special bill of rights (the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights) which was meant to give police officers special provisions and anonymity. When a complaint is made about an officer, these complaints are handled internally and without oversight by any other body. No feds. No citizens. No elected officials. Just cops policing cops. So when cops DO make an unwarranted stop, or unnecessary arrest, or kill an innocent person, the only people policing this matter are....other cops. The protests are saying that the disproportionate amount of attention the cops give to black people and their communities is NOT because of ""black culture"" but because the police have no oversight and many hold beliefs similar to you. That black people commit more crime."
8404,gvf2rj,Well technically it just gets printed everytime the bubbles we create through easy credit and bad loans  go pop.
8405,gvf2rj,Ok prove it
8406,gvf2rj,"Then wouldn't you agree that the only answer we have is the hard one? We can't pretend like there is another answer, we can't offer empty sentiments. We need to offer the hard truth.

And one of the reasons for that is because BLM doesn't have a real goal. Look at their page, they talk about justice and equality and standing up for rights and marching when people wrongfully die. But what do they actually do?

The founders of it want to completely restructure society, they are basically socialist/communists and this is the vague cause that they use to support it. No one can argue with equality or justice, especially when no one gets specific about. So as much as I'd like to help black Americans, destroying the country with communism and wealth redistribution won't help at all.

So unfortunately, while we can offer support and understanding and a kind ear... we can't just turn over and let them have whatever they want because it very well might ruin us."
8407,gvf2rj,"That is nice but what does it mean?

If a person is murdered b a cop, we convict the cop, we throw the cop in jail, and inevitably the victim's family will receive monetary compensation and if everyone has called it wrong, then what else is there?

It is a wonderful notion you share here and I agree with it in spirit. But it's rather shallow in its effect. In other words, the intent is good but if a black person commits a crime like burglary, the police attempt to arrest them, and then he puts up a fight and then pulls out a gun and tries to shoot the officer, what am I supposed to do?

If that were a white person I would say the cop had every right to put him down. I can't sit here and say there is systemic racism if my neighbor sees THAT as systemic racism simply because it was a cop killing a person, because it wasn't a cop killing a person, it was a cop defending himself.

Floyd's case was obviously different, but what am I supposed to do for my neighbor in this regard? I called it out, I said it was wrong. I can't say for certain it was racism, but it could have been. I'm not going to lie and say something was most certainly racist when I don't know. I said Chauvin should be tried for murder. I think he is a piece of shit, but at the same time I want him to have a fair trial and to be punished appropriately.

See we conservatives tend to play the long game while the left plays the short game. We push for justice and for us to let the system work, but the left seems to want Chauvin's head on a pike right now. I understand that anger and that desire, but if that's how we proceed, that's not justice. 

So what specifically am I supposed to do for my black neighbors? Give up my job so they can have one? I have a family I need to take care of. Is that right?

Should I fight for reparations? I'm sorry, but there are black people who find that notion offensive and it won't help anything anyway. I didn't do anything to cause slavery, I've always called it wrong, I have no relatives that caused slavery. Yet I'm supposed to pay for that?

If you are a victim of abuse and the abuser is long dead, you are still left with the difficulty of living a life with all the issues that came with being abused. You have to try to succeed despite the anxiety and anger that bubbles up, you have to try to succeed despite the depression you deal with because of it... there are so many lasting ways that abuse can make your life harder. And there is this natural desire to want to find a way to right was done to you. What do you do? The abuser is dead. Do you grab a gun and steal from others because you feel you can't succeed due to the PTSD from your abuse? Do you go begging in the streets? Do you petition the government to compensate you for something no one did to you except your abuser? Do you make your fellow man pay for your living expenses?

None of that rights the wrong done to you. You ASK for help, knowing no one owes it to you but hoping people will (and they will but not everyone you ask will). You keep pushing through your pain, you make little changes to your life to keep getting better, and hopefully one day, you make a life for yourself despite all the hardship.

So again, I'm happy to help communities. But you are forgetting the most important part of the equation, individuals need to step up and better their own lives, too.

I can be as understanding about how bad a young black man has had, and I can try to help. But if that young black man keeps on stealing or hating white people or acting like a thug, nothing I do will help. Some might straight up refuse the help, I've seen it happen.

So the community tries to help in different ways. Gangs are a horrible problem in minority communities, so we want to try to help those people who might be pushed into a gang. How do we do that? Well we might support groups that reach out to them, that's one way, though usually they'd rather hear from black people than white people. Another way is simply to police the area and arrest gang members to scare others away from joining them and to remove the threat of these gangs from the neighborhood so it's a nicer place to live. But what has happened? Snitches get stitches. So many people in the communities we would like to help refuse to snitch on the criminals. And it's not usually because they're scared, it's often because they don't trust cops or hate cops or something. They seem to feel like pulling one over on the cops is a victory against whitey or something. But they are shooting themselves in the foot. They are letting crime run rampant.

So we try to help our community but in many cases they haven't taken it. And I'm not trying to generalize here, there so many who have taken the help, who stay away from crime, who speak out against the crime in their communities. Yet there are so man who do not.

So what should I do?"
8408,gvf2rj,"I don't think it needs to be protested. The man is in jail facing murder charges. Justice is being done. There is nothing to protest.

If equality is the goal, then justice being dealt out to the cop is pretty equal treatment."
8409,gvf2rj,"Well at least you are admitting it's your interpretation while constantly baiting me with your childish insults. And now you have some problem with the Bundeswehrs Iron Cross on one of their military vehicles. Just so you know, the Germans are great people and that is somehow an issue? I think you are part of the Lefts victimhood culture, always looking for ""micro-aggression"" where your interpretation is more important than the intended meaning so you can be offended and virtue signal to the world. Sometimes facts are without predudice and they just don't make someone look good. It happens.

Edit: I would like to add, there is no switcheroo.  You are equating money and financial success with human value. These should be decoupled because some of the best, brightest, and most beloved people in the world, and who I admire were flat broke poor. I fly to Soy Kenya every year to help build a school, for the last five years, it's almost finished, and the people there are rich. Very rich."
8410,gvf2rj,"I'm saying you cannot rule out that the force was deserved, because it may have been. This is stupid reasoning akin to saying we should see 50/50 gender divides in careers.

8413,gvf2rj,This chart shows that black folks are killed by police at a far higher rate in Democratic leaning states. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt fit the expectations.
8414,gvf2rj,[deleted]
8415,gvf2rj,"First of all, your claim was that everyone else ""shut up"" about these issues.

Second of all, Daniel Shaver's situation was absolutely horrific. It was much worse than the George Floyd incident in that there was absolutely no plausible deniability for anyone involved. There was no outdated training that told them to act that way, and there was no confusion over whether the man was telling the truth to get out of being arrested. It was just a sadistic psychopath playing simon-says where you are crying and begging for your life, and still get shot if you lose.

And your ""protesting""? Social media solidarity. For a single day. You are being disingenuous if you are legitimately trying to claim there is any consistency in how these deaths are received."
8416,gvf2rj,"Thank you, that was very educating. The left usually doesn‚Äôt provide much about gun education or custom. Thank you for explaining that to me I appreciate it. To be honest it gives me a little bit of peace to know that it wasn‚Äôt necessarily an issue based off of race alone. I think it would be fair to say that sometimes the left make things about race where race was not the case to begin with."
8417,gvf2rj,"I‚Äôm not saying flat numbers are the best way of analyzing the data, but per capita isn‚Äôt the best either. There are far too many variable to factor in. 

You seem to be thinking I‚Äôm arguing for flat numbers to be used when I‚Äôm arguing for neither to be used."
8418,gvf2rj,...Which is why everyone is using per capita instead of total population.
8419,gvf2rj,"Yes, similar to that math. I'm the one that responded to him and explained why he was wrong. Feel free to read it.

The fact that you are showing this to me tells me that you have no idea what you are talking about in your comments. You are just spreading misinformation because you refuse to internalize the facts being told here."
8420,gvf2rj,"First of all, both of my sources were from independent privately enterprises, not the government or ‚Äúthe system‚Äù. Secondly, I didn‚Äôt mention the protests and I didn‚Äôt say I was on Derek Chauvin‚Äôs, he committed 3rd degree murder and there should be a separate governing body that convicts wrongful murder by a police officer. Or better yet, body cams for all cops so that the courts can handle cases without obstruction of evidence. Thirdly, policing isn‚Äôt higher in primarily black communities because of black culture or racism, it‚Äôs higher because crime is higher. The race of the people there is irrelevant, where crime is higher, there will be more cops. Cops don‚Äôt immediately police black neighborhoods because they assume they‚Äôll commit crime, they police neighborhoods where there is crime, and it happens to be that statistically most neighborhoods with crime have larger than average black American population. Correlation is not causation. Finally, my point about culture was that there has to be some reason black people are committing disproportionately more crime and disproportionately failing high school. I‚Äôd the reason isn‚Äôt culture then what is it? It can‚Äôt be race because all races are equal, and to suggest otherwise would be racist. It can‚Äôt be systematic oppression because as far as I‚Äôm aware there are currently no laws that target black people in particular, and if there are, point them to me and we will both agree that they are wrong. So you explain to me why black people commit disproportionately more crime. Because if crime results in policing, and unfavorable policing is the issue, we must get to the root of the issue."

8422,gvf2rj,Single income households trying to provide for more than one person will obviously make less money than a two parent income household. That is common sense and does not need a source. The part about fatherless households is just an assumption on his part as most of the time the father is the one no longer in the picture.
8423,gvf2rj,"I enjoyed your conversation/discussion. Just wanted to chime in and say I sympathize with odieman1232 in the sense that.... it's just really hard to help people man. So I don't know the answer either.

I've tried helping family and friends, and sometimes it's just frustrating to see some people are not willing/ready to change.

I also agree with you, the hard truth is undeniable. The statistics speak by themselves. The problem I see is: how do we help our brothers and sisters get out of those statistics?"

8428,gvf2rj,"First. The shut up was how I interpreted your statement not my beliefs. If that is not yours, I apologize. 

Second. They are both horrific, not one worse than the other. I will not compare and contrast murder victims. They both were unnecessary. They both was due to shitty policing. 

Third. I don't have social media outside of this. I haven't logged into Facebook since 2012. I believe my last tweet was 2015. Don't have an Instagram. I will be glad to give to my link so you can verify yourself. But I protest in the streets. I am fortunate enough to still have a job so I cannot protest as often as I would like, but in the same breath I have donated to both Bail funds for protesters that have been locked up, and have donated to the politicians who have said that are making legislation to hold cops more accountable.


Edit: The Miami Harold has an article about BlackLivesMatter protest on the shooting of Charles Kinsey who was a (Black)man who was shot while protecting a mentally disabled (not black) man from being shot by the police. They protested the injustice that was shown to both victims."
8429,gvf2rj,"According to Fatal Encounters, the database created by former Reno News & Review editor and journalism instructor Burghart (which tracks all deaths resulting from interactions with police), a total of 1,388 people were killed by police in 2015, 318 (23%) of them black, and 560 (40%) of them white. So roughly 23 percent of those killed by any police interaction in 2015 were black and just over 40 percent were white. According to those statistics (adjusted for racial demographics), black people had a 2.7 higher likelihood of being killed by police than whites."
8430,gvf2rj,"Right but the private enterprises get their data from the police reports. So the data is essentially controlled by them. You are absolutely right, there should be a way to convict cops of murder. The three cops that watched the act happen should be arrested to as they were complacent. They haven't been. Why? Because cops are protected by the Law Enforcement Officer Bill of rights. That is what has prolonged these protests and will likely be the focus of the legislative action that will be the result of them. You keep saying that culture is somehow separate from race and I don't quite know what you mean by that. If you mean black culture than that is intrinsically tied to race and I don't seem them as separate. What about black neighborhoods are so different from white ones besides their race? If you are implying that socio economic differences in community are to blame (ie poor people commit more crime, and black people are statistically poorer than white people, ipso facto black poor people commit more crime) then why aren't prison populations more representative of the distribution of race in low income communities (in america low income communites are 40% white and only 20% black)? The oppression in this case is not about oppressive laws. Its about a system of policing the police. The thought that black communities commit more crime is either based on the belief that they do so because of their race or based on data that was collected by those that had that belief (which has been collected by cops since the reconstruction era when the police force was created). Whether you believe you are racist or not doesnt really matter though. Can we agree that the police need oversight? Should cops be required to have their badge number displayed on their uniform at all times? Should cops be required to have WORKING body cams at risk of obstruction of justice charges? Should cops be granted anonymity and protections against conviction when they break the law while on the job? I can show you cases where white people are brutalized, framed and murdered by police too if that makes it easier for you."
8431,gvf2rj,I‚Äôd like to see u/PrincessTreetop‚Äôs response now lol
8432,gvf2rj,"I look at this like seeing a friend with a drug abuse issue. I've stood by their side, I've given them money, I've gone with them to Narcotics Anonymous, I've helped them find a therapist, I've helped them find a job. Each time it fell through, each time they didn't push, maybe they didn't even try. Maybe I set up an appointment for them and they didn't even attempt to show up. We can blame the addiction, but when that's all we do, he never has to make the choice to stop listening to his addiction and actually push to make an appointment.

At some point, you have to have that conversation with him... you have to tell him that you can't help him anymore because he's not trying to help himself. So you have to stop lending them money, you have to stop setting appointments for them they won't go to.

There are those on welfare right now who could get off it but won't because it's right there. Then they fester, they feel like they aren't worth anything, they get negative and act like it's all our fault. We are robbing so many people of the pride of making a real living by giving them welfare or making it so easy to do so.

Less crime happens when more people have jobs. Terrorism thrives in the Middle East among people who don't have jobs. People are not happy when they don't work. So one of the things we can do is something Trump was trying to do which is tying welfare benefits very tightly to work. Meaning that if you aren't trying to work, if you aren't picking up a few hours at McDonald's or something and you don't have some kind of extenuating circumstance that prevents you from working, then you don't get help. Working, even if it's just a little bit for money that you earned yourself gives you a sense of pride that Democrats have robbed them of for decades. And it's scary to make that change, but like a drug addict friend, the fear is part of the motivator. The fear of losing the support of the friend is part of what motivates the drug addict to succeed.

I mean this is kind of basic, common sense stuff. But it's scary and hard, and it can feel like you're being abandoned at first. But really what you're doing as a friend is setting reasonable boundaries and making your drug addict friend abide by them... you are encouraging your friend to rise to the occasion by teaching them that they can't just take and take and take from you without putting any effort in.

I don't mean to say all black people are addicts or something, but culturally minorities living in poverty, white, black, Hispanic, anyone really, once they get on welfare, a lot of times it is enough to never even try to get off it. So we need to make it a less comfortable spot to be in."

Is this the quote you're referring to?  Because I don't see how that is linked to the China ban. From what I read it, it seemed like that quote was just talking about Trump himself and his use of the phrase ""China virus"" and that it didn't relate to the travel restrictions. Sounds like it was taken out of context. Do you have any sources for the people that were against this travel restriction? Would like to see which dumbasses thought we should keep the border open.

Yes! Sanders did not support the travel restrictions, but Biden is on record too.  With that quote you supplied.  I know you said you don't see how it's linked to the China ban, but I'll show you.  it's in that last link you shared (I'm going to **bold** the quote below, but only so you can see what I mean)

&#x200B;

>The first case of coronavirus was reported in the U.S. on January 21, 2020. A traveler who had visited China had tested positive on arriving in Washington state. A day later, Trump had claimed at a news conference that things were under control.  
>  
>Over the next few days, as the number of cases in the U.S. increased, the White House started its coronavirus response task force, headed by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. **On January 31, Trump issued an executive order blocking entry to the U.S. from anyone who has been in China in the last 14 days. The order came into effect on February 2.** It did not include U.S. residents and family members or spouses of U.S. residents or citizens. Azar also declared the coronavirus crisis a public health emergency.  
>  
>**On February 2, 2020, Biden tweeted, 'We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science ‚Äî not Donald Trump's record of hysteria, xenophobia and fear mongering.** He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.' Biden's tweet was a rehash of a similar comment he had made at a campaign in Iowa held on January 31.

So while Biden has backpedaled on what he meant by the quote, the date the order came into effect (Feb 2) is the same day that Biden made his tweet about President Trump and his ""record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear mongering"".    

It 100% was a response to the executive order going through.

&#x200B;

Jump forward to 24-Feb, 3 weeks AFTER Trump imposed the restrictions,  and Pelosi was in Chinatown campaigning for how safe it was.  Unmasked...  large gatherings.  mind you; this was a full three weeks before everything shut down... but the point is; while she harps on Trump's slow response.  Trump was responding to pandemic in accordance to how it was escalating.   He felt that with the growing number of cases; the safest bet would be to impose restrictions.

&#x200B;

But also, Pelosi was right to be in Chinatown on 24Feb too.  On that date; there had been ZERO reported cases of Covid in that city.  Why would it be shut down?  Pelosi was right to think that DJT was overreacting...

&#x200B;

But then 3 weeks later we were in total shutdown (by executive order).  Mind you; we still had less than 3 thousand total reported cases and what?  just a handful of deaths? But under advisement, President Trump thought it best to be safe than sorry. He gambled by sticking to his guns when Biden, Sanders and Pelosi were pushing against him...  and it paid off for the American people. 

Had we listened to Biden and Pelosi, I‚Äôm not sure how things would be right now.

Edit: One other thing that I never really noticed is that the first reported case of Corona (in the US) was on 21January.  He imposed restrictions 10 days later when there were only [six positive cases](https://dchealth.dc.gov/publication/january-31-2020-update-and-interim-guidance-novel-coronavirus-2019-cov-outbreak) (5 from travel)... zero deaths.  They knock his slow response time, but how much faster was he supposed to act?  It was literally the day after the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a ‚Äúpublic health emergency of international concern‚Äù.  

The next day! 


If people want to dump on Trump for not wearing a mask, that‚Äôs one thing. If they want to dump on him for HCQ, that‚Äôs another.. but dump on him for slow response time?  Fuck that noise."

They say police are overusing their force, meanwhile they are literally looting, burning, and threatening cops more than the cops are threatening them.

If you punch a cop, the cop will shoot you or at least give you a beating. Common sense.

I am actually disgusted at these smooth brains not being able to prevent themselves from overusing force, while blaming the police on it.

‚ÄúOMG THE POLICE SHOT MY FRIEND BECAUSE HE TRIED TO PULL OUT A KNIFE OMG POLICE VIOLENCE OMG TRUMP IS CORRUPT‚Äù"

Now I'm depressed! :("
8679,ikoj1u,Glad to see some a bit of truth there. But what gets me is the part where I believe it was fox news said the federal officers continued their overnight attack on...wait for it.....anti-racist protestors! Wtf?!?
8680,ikoj1u,The sad thing is it might as well be 1975. Nobody can fucking remember anything older than 2 weeks man.
8681,ikoj1u,Absolutely! They are all one sided. I have seen plenty of clips of Biden creepy ass and immoral shit he has supported. Trump has done more in 3 years then any president before him. Biden new thing is how the death rate has went up since 2014......fucking moron...we are in a worldwide pandemic.
8682,ikoj1u,"Deadly Violence is already there, day and night, and Force is necessary to end this.these rioters are out of controlled and destroying innocent lives and property and FOR  WHAT?? Those people aren't the police, they aren't the target for these rioters? So what about all the innocent citizens of these cities. But theres the difference between force and deadly force."
8683,ikoj1u,"Good, I am happy to read that. the media is dividing this country and they are to blame for turning us against one another."
8684,ikoj1u,"And those of us on the right have known it about CNN and MSNBC.

But y'all on the left didn't care, preferring instead to attack Fox."

8686,ikoj1u,Your lost bud you need back to r/Politics
8687,ikoj1u,"Yeah, but the feds did not improve the situation, which is the point.  The reason Brown and Wheeler didn't want the feds is because the feds being there made the situation worse than it already was.  Attempting to repair the situation with more feds will not solve the issue or de-escalate things.  If anything, it'll only escalate the situation more.

People post like the protesters are the ones escalating the situation, but I was there, sitting down with a couple hundred people in Pioneer Square, listening to some people talk, when the cops started shooting pepper rounds at us.  I was downtown last weekend, when Patriot Prayer or whoever the hell showed up macing protestors while the cops vanished, and thankfully I was home before the cops DID show up - well after the antagonists left - because they started gassing the crowd immediately after.

Increasing the police presence isn't the way to put an end to these protests.  The protests are about demilitarizing the police and stopping police brutality, and the police and the feds coming in and acting the way they have has only proven to a lot of people that it's worth it to go to these protests.  It simply galvanized the opposing sides and made everyone even more pissed off than they already were."

8693,ikoj1u,Nice that is good to hear. Would be incredible if we flipped NY.
8694,ikoj1u,Yes this is true. I am hoping for a better future for America. Yeah there‚Äôs actually a lot more supporters than you think but we all know better to just keep to ourselves
8695,ikoj1u,"It's not that simple.

In fact after studying history and politics for most of my life, I find it to be both misleading and a lie.

The Republican party has *always* had its true roots not in big cities or by racists, but by homesteaders, business owners, blue collar workers, farmers and people who care about maintaining and protecting the traditional values of the constitution and of the country which meant freeing the slaves, having a small military and staying out of international affairs.

Meanwhile, the Democratic party was founded on principles of populism, slavery, greater government control, letting in unlimited amounts of immigration and being against free trade.

The two parties haven't flipped, they've fused (progressive era) and then split apart with radically different platforms.

Today, the Republican party is backed by farmers, blue collar workers, conservative Christians, small and medium sized businesses, free--fair trade, government out of the personal lives of people unless it comes to matters of life and death (abortion), in theory we believe in smaller or at least more efficient government services and in recent years we've undergone a change from being pro-war to being pro-peace through strength--maintaining a powerful military capable of defending the country and reacting to threats as they arise. 

There's a lot more to say but much of this will be outdated in 4 months when the president is sworn in again because we are living through the next great ""realignment"" in american politics: that of blue collar workers shifting to the Republican party and Elite businesses and tech workers solidly going democrat."
8696,ikoj1u,"I can also find tons of videos and news reports of why this is a lie, and a lie that is being pushed by the media and the far left, they need to make republicans the bad folks in order to retain power and have a vast majority of minority voters stay in part lines.

&#x200B;

 Seriously Look at it, go to Baltimore there is a low income area around where Edgar Allan Poes museum is.  In the short time I was in this area I could see how ran down the area was, kids going to neighbors to play with guns, had a broom swung at me because I was a ""long way from starbuck"".

 But here is the thing, I don't hate these people nor do I blame them, they got sold a lie that free means your life is better, but it left these people poor, and since the area was poor and on government assistance the schools were poor because no taxes were coming in. So basically with this idea we segregated a lot of schools, left schools in these areas underfunded and then crime sky rockets in these areas.

&#x200B;

 The parties never switched the Dems did what they wanted to do the whole time re segregate the country turn Black against white and make everything about racism, Hate fuels people more than hope, but it also destroys them."

8702,ikoj1u,The stuff I've seen them do to cops with no repercussions makes my jaw drop.  When I was a younger man I did some protesting and the one time I got annoyed because the cops were protecting so and so... I decided to push one of the cops... holy crap did I learn humility that day.
8703,ikoj1u,Everything is trump's fault and all us Trump supporters are racist.  Funny how now the riot states are accepting help Biden is trying to say it's about time and trump condoned the violence. There are clear post from the last 100+ days where they were turning it down. Let them burn their cities down and build a wall around them. Let them have what they created. Watch the governor's try and get federal assistance to rebuild too. I won't allow my tax dollers to go to any of that. Let the governor's figure it out since they can't talk accountability. Accountability is dead in this day in age.

No, be honest.  They don't want the feds because they think the violence was making Trump look bad.

But ... we have all watched Trump call for it to stop and even TRY (in Portland) to get it stopped while the left resisted.

NOW...it's polling badly for them so SUDDENLY they are saying Trump wants it.

I have trouble understanding the difference between the police being given that power and the president doing the same to protect American civilians and service members. 

I have the same problem with Obama. I also have it with police."

If we find out the school has been putting up the same road blocks for them, then this is a very good idea that we will support them on.

Edit: I‚Äôd also like to add that the Black Republicans S.O. are equally excited to meet with us, and so far have been incredibly kind & polite in their correspondence. They only created their separate S.O.

So yes, there haven't really been marches for him but his killing wasn't a case of police brutality, which is what the marches are mainly about.

Anyone of us here can be wrongfully harmed or killed by a cop with no consequence and that Is not right. In fact more white people are killed by cops and every year the number of police fatalities go up for all races. Both parties are shit because they divide us and teach us to blame each other while they build their authoritarian rule. They don't want us to unite and the more we blame each other, the further from justice we get. I grew up in America and was proud to be an American. I always wanted to join the military as well, Now that I can join I see that I will only become a cog in the machine designed to destroy the America I love, and when the time comes that I can no longer serve my country, that machine will throw me in the trash like they did my father and his father."

8817,hzewo5,Bullshit lmao. Zero evidence that this was racially provoked. Riddle me this: why have 3 times the number of white people been killed by police than black people?
8818,hzewo5,"woah woah woah, this is a thread for jerking eachother off over perceived hypocrisy of an amorphous, leaderless organization for not having immediately condemned the killing of a black conservative (even though a few seconds of research would show the killing as not having been motivated by race or political beliefs,) so get your facts out of here! Also, did I mention how republicans are actually the party of people who are absolutely fed up with identity politics?"
8819,hzewo5,The notion of systemic racism is bullshit. It is merely an excuse to transform our political structure into another one‚Äîa far less liberal (in the classic sense) one. The closest thing to systemic racism is the blatant racism applied in favor of blacks and against Asians and whites. Other than that there is none.
8820,hzewo5,"My main problem with BLM is their management of funds. When you donate to BLM, it directly goes to ActBlue, where unclaimed funds are given to Joe Biden's campaign."

8822,hzewo5,"All I see is crickets. What about the BLM movement raising awareness for the young autistic boy who was shot in Louisiana. I guess those protests are being drown out by all the protests of the ""all lives matter"" crowd. You need to know who Daniel shaver and Jeremy Mardis are. BLM is stepping up because you all aren't"

8824,hzewo5,"Don Lemon's use of all diseases was the inaccuracy.

'Black Lives Matter' implies all black lives. Just like 'Cancer Matters' implies all types of cancer.

Expanding Cancer Matters to focus on HIV (as in Don's example) would be like expanding BLM to focus on another races' problems. 

Expecting BLM to focus on all black lives (as Terry Crews asked) would be like expecting Cancer Matters to include all types of cancer, and not limit itself to rare forms of the disease. Which is a reasonable expectation, given their name."
8825,hzewo5,"\> You‚Äôre basically just criticizing and belittling the organization for their name  


Like in Parks & Recs there was a cult that called themselves ""The Reasonablists"" so that disagreeing with them made it seem like you were unreasonable, BLM makes it seem like you think black lives don't matter if you don''t agree with them.  


Hop over to Facebook, Twitter, or even somewhere where regular people are and say ""I don't agree with Black Lives Matter"" and tell me what kind of backlash you get."
8826,hzewo5,Their issue is basically non existent. Their leaders are actual marxists and their martyrs are usually poorly chosen.
8827,hzewo5,I like your take on it. Sometimes people only see what will make them feel justified.
8828,hzewo5,"Well, BLM is always saying black people commit crime because of racial injustice."
8829,hzewo5,"Right? Nearly three thousand blacks were murdered in 2018. Was there supposed to be protest for each individual? No, because not only would that be absurd, but it's also not their focus. They're focused on police/state brutality and vigilantism against the black community. Not any ol' murder. Everyone agrees murder is wrong. There's nothing to protest, especially if it wasn't perpetrated by government employee. What everyone does not agree upon is racial bias within police brutality."

THIS is systemic racism. George Floyd was a man who deserved to live, regardless of his past. he was not a ""thug"". the thugs are the police men who stood over him and watched him die.

and what does ""Breonna Taylor was sketchy"" even mean? the police broke into her house and murdered her while she was sleeping. how can you possibly justify her death, either morally or legally?"

8854,hzewo5,"The criminal justice system has systemic racism, the war on drugs proves it. Crack and Cocaine have the exact same chemical properties however Crack was more popular in black communities. Having 1 gram of crack would get you the same sentence as someone with 100 grams of cocaine leading to substantially longer prison sentences for black people than white people. Nixon administration advisors later went on to admit that the targets of the war on drugs were the anti-war left (marijuana) and black people (crack). I can give more examples of systemic racism too."
8855,hzewo5,The top 10 recipients who benefit from BLM donations were also all white people.  Biden being #2 i believe
8856,hzewo5,He can't. There's really no viewpoint where BLM is actually a good organization.
8857,hzewo5,Lol....
8858,hzewo5,"Clearly, BLM only focuses on black lives ended by white cops. Probably an infinitesimally small percentage of all black murders annually. So, like all victim cultures, blame someone else. Easier than taking a hard look at one's own shortcomings."
8859,hzewo5,"Your revised analogy is overlooking that there is no similarity between the death of George Floyd and the death of Bernell Trammell aside from the fact that a black man died wrongfully. It ignores who did it and why. It ignores what is wrongful. Writing off BLM as OP is doing by engaging superficially with their cause in this way, and then ascribing bad faith motivations for this supposed discrepancy, does nothing for anyone but reinforce political tribalism.

'Black Lives Matter' implies much more than just pointing out the existence of wrongful deaths of black people. It implies addressing and correcting that which precipitates what is wrongful in the first place. It suggests every black life taken wrongfully is a tragedy that should be taken seriously, and not used merely as a convenient statistic to cudgel ones political adversaries with and reinforce one's prejudices as OP does here."
8860,hzewo5,"Exactly, they limit the scope of BLM to a small minority of black lives lost. While simultaneously expanding it to include other political goals such as Marxism, immigration, defunding police, etc. And when someone disagrees with them, they jump back to the slogan's plain meaning of all black lives mattering, and use it to paint the critic as someone who denies that."
8861,hzewo5,"The issue is that police kill with impunity in the US, and blacks are disproportionately the victim of it so they are the face of the movement. Compare 1004 people shot and killed by police in the US in 2019 (not including chokeouts) versus 14 shot and killed in Germany by police the same year. Germany has 1/4th the US population but 1.4% as much police murder. To act like US police violence and their ability to get away with it isnt a problem is pretty obtuse.

If you‚Äôre only focused on black on black crime statistics as a whataboutism retort, you‚Äôre missing the point. It is about police injustice and reform.

This sub is absolutely toxic lol."
8862,hzewo5,"I like how you as a white male can tell grieving black people that their issues are ""basically non existent."" The level of ignorance and delusion is not shocking, but pitiful."
8863,hzewo5,"I think that‚Äôs only part of what BLM says. From what I‚Äôve read, they definitely believe that is a part of the problem, but to say that‚Äôs their stance always is misleading/untrue. 

If you have a source of them saying that then I‚Äôm open to being corrected though."
8864,hzewo5,"They mean in a systemic way. The system has been keeping black people as poor and powerless as possible for the last 400 years, leading to many to fall in a life of crime. Thus, the racial injustice has led to the conditions of lots of black crime happening. They don‚Äôt mean some guys out there are committing crimes just because someone‚Äôs been racist or something."
8865,hzewo5,I don't believe there is racial bias.  More whites were killed by the police.  Blacks commit more crimes.  Facts say that you all are full of shit
8866,hzewo5,"By that logic would we not assume the guy in red was a blood, not a pretend MAGA impersonator?"
8867,hzewo5,"It absolutely should be brought into this when the agenda behind the widespread acceptance of abortions in the mid 20th century was specifically targeted at black communities in order to control their population. And it still disproportionately kills black babies. Whether you think it‚Äôs murder or not, it‚Äôs an issue."
8868,hzewo5,Unfortunately it's a perfectly valid criticism - just because abortion is *blaise* to leftists doesn't mean it's not destroying a human life for (most of the time) conveniences sake.
8869,hzewo5,He WAS NOT murdered. He died in custody after fighting with the police. He had drugs in his system and COVID. His death was negligent at worst.
8870,hzewo5,"Nope. Never said that. Simply said that if BLM makes such a ruckus over someone like George Floyd's death, then they should show equal activism for people like the St. Louis Police Captain, but they won't show any support because he was murdered by their own protesters."
8871,hzewo5,"BS. The police had a warrant to break into Taylor's apartment. Her boyfriend got up and fired randomly, wounding one of the police officers. This led to the police retaliating."
8872,hzewo5,"He was a piece of shit thug and it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered what color he was. He died in custody, he was not murdered, the police were negligent at worst. No one would have given a flying FUCK if Floyd was white. It would have just been shit happens.  This is nothing more than a political move to get Trump out of office. Change my mind"
8873,hzewo5,Well he basically killed himself so.....
8874,hzewo5,They matter as much as any other lives
8875,hzewo5,"Okay, so you obviously don't understand what's going on here.

BLM is a communist organization that is trying to use black deaths to push their agenda. Understood till here? Ok. For that reason, I dont support them. I support the NAACP, which actually cares about black lives."
8876,hzewo5,"What did you think? Of course I care about black lives, I'm fully in support with NAACP, an organization that actually cares about black lives. BLM is 100% corrupt. All the money is bypassed to ActBlue, I literally have evidence of it. You're the one who doesnt know shit, fucking jackass."

The state of Venezuela is a testament to the destructive nature of socialism. Use your brain, think for yourself."
8883,hzewo5,"No, the war on drugs proves nothing of the sort. There are large differences in the effects of crack and powder cocaine and the impact on communities, which is why many people‚Äîincluding activists like Jesse Jackson‚Äîagitated for higher penalties for crack cocaine dealers. As of 1991 most crack cocaine users were white as well. And 1g of crack was enough to sell 10 rocks because of the form and consumption process.

The higher penalties for crack were introduced in the 1980‚Äôs, not in 1970. Nixon had nothing to do with crack cocaine penalties.

Not much of a systemic racism evidence."

8888,hzewo5,"I'm actually half arab, but w.e. I don't see why that would matter."
8889,hzewo5,You realize you just described redlining which was made illegal right?
8890,hzewo5,"More white people are killed by the police because there are way more white people then black people. 

Statistically speaking, black people do commit more crime on average than whites people, and this could lead to a racial bias amongst police officers towards black peoples. Alternatively, it could be that there was a racial bias towards black people that led to their over-policing and inflated crime rate. Or it could be a mix of the two.

However, it‚Äôs clear to see that black people experience a stronger racial bias against them. The studies ranging from things how often police are pulled over or called out in traffic stops to the chances of dying to police relative to other races, black people most certainly have the worst of it all."

The implication of the warrant was that Glover was sending packages to Taylor's house. Taylor previously dated Glover and may have stayed on close terms, and the investigator allegedly determined that Glover must be using her house to deliver drugs to.

However, once they actually reviewed these findings (after the fact, mind you) none of this held up. A lot of this is on the judge who signed the 5 warrants for Glover, all within 12 minutes. Hardly enough time for an appropriate review.

Thus, the police allegedly determined that Taylor's house must be either housing Glover or drugs. **They were wrong.** Taylor had nothing to do with the situation, and if they had spent time actually confirming any of this, **they would have realized they had the wrong house.**

For the record, the cops are not the only ones that should be held accountable in this case. Judge Shaw failed horribly here."
8895,hzewo5,So black lives matter
8896,hzewo5,"Nah sorry I didn‚Äôt get it, you‚Äôre really not making sense haha. Tell me again how vouching for black people‚Äôs lives and being a decent human being has anything to do with communism or an agenda? NAACP supports BLM too, and vice versa.

Also you assume quite a bit with regard to my statements.

The idea that anything close to socialism could florish while the driving force of a population is capitalism is absurd, you are correct."
8905,hzewo5,"1. The effects of crack and powder cocaine have small differences; the prices are similar, one rock of crack is about 20 dollars which is usually around a quarter of a gram, while a gram of cocaine is about 80-100 dollars; the effects of crack are shorter and slightly stronger while powder cocaine is has a longer lasting effect but not as strong; and both have other similarities.

2. Regardless of when the majority of penalties were introduced, Nixon's attempt to target black people still proves systemic racism in the form of laws or regultion intended to hurt a certain population.

And even if you don't agree with that, stuff like lack of access to the GI bill put black people years behind economically. Especially when considering that the GI bill was a huge part of economic development following World War two.

It's pretty hard to deny some form of systemic racism considering that Jim Crow has only been abolished for 60 years, residual effects are obviously still going to exist for the same reason that some people are rich because of their lineage (access to education, etc.). Systemic racism doesn't mean that white people are bad, nor does it mean that black people are just eternally fucked, rather it's just something that has existed that we must ensure doesn't  continue."

It could have been because Floyd was high on fentanyl at the time of arrest. There is ZERO evidence that this was racism at play here. Imo, the only issue here is police brutality, which is exactly what we need to combat, not something abstract like ""systemic racism""."
8913,hzewo5,Yes they do. They matter as much as any other lives
8914,hzewo5,"Nope, you're horribly wrong. Patrisse Cullors, the co-founder of BLM herself said that her organization consisted of ""trained Marxists"".

Derek Chauvin wasnt racist. He killed as many white people as black people. Yet, when a black criminal dies, it's automatically classified as an instance of systemic racism. Riddle me that?"
8920,hzewo5,"No, Nixon didn‚Äôt attempt to target blacks. In fact, Nixon was the person who signed the EO 11478 mandating further affirmative action (discrimination) in federal contracting. To pretend that Nixon was targeting blacks with drug laws is just revisionist history.

As for differences between powder and crack cocaine they were very large. Crack is much more psychologically addictive than powder cocaine and crack destroyed poor communities, particularly black ones. Going after crack dealers had nothing to do with racism and everything to do with ending a drug plague.

Finally, not only were Jim Crow laws not passed around the entire country but it has been nearly 3 generations since those laws were knocked down. The laws and legally enforced discrimination of over a half a century ago have no impact on people‚Äôs behaviors today. To pretend so is to just excuse poor decision making and get more of the same."

8927,hzewo5,"well idk man , from the outside , outside the american culture , that looked like a deliberate slow clear and explicit execution. I think the only reasonable reaction at that point , for any policemen that would want to claim any sort of moral highground , would have been to aprehend the murderes and throw them in jail , on the spot . I know i am biased , i live in the developed civilized world where a policeman killing a civilian is a major huge issue, i dont think anywhere in Europe those two would have been out of a cell more that 15 minutes after such a murder. 

systemic racism is abstract? My ass! you had racism enshrined in law all the way to the 60's didnt you?you failed to even attempt to extirpate and destroy the ideological remnants of the confederation, you stll have plenty of people flying american nazi flags..and no systemic racism you say?"

The top of the article is what i'm reffering to. 

However, framing it as 3 generations is disengenuous, people who are still alive today were disadvanted because of Jim crow laws. Accessibility to things such as the GI bills had long term effects. When economic inequality widens and a group of people can't access higher education; crime increases and economic opportunities dissapear. Which in turn generally effect the next generation and their accessibility to these things.

I definitely agree that personal responsibility is a large factor, however ignoring the past and how it influences the present completely disregards structural factors regarding any community. Again, recognizing the existence of systemic racism is not a bad thing, and if you can't say with complete certainty that it doesn't exist then there's no harm in considering how it might influence different communities."

9036,is9hvp,"That's the systemic racism that people parrot but dont actually understand.


Cities all across this country were planned and divided throughout their development to keep the blacks over ""there"" The right and the wrong side of the tracks. 


But this isn't just a racial issue, it's a class and urban issue. Inner cities always have higher crime rates then the surrounding areas, regardless of the race occupying those areas. What matters is that whatever ""other"" are poor and viewed as racially inferior. Think of crime rates and racial profiling  of the Irish and Italians in new York's early history. 


The unique issue in with black people in america is that by and large their cultural heritage was literally formed by people who new nothing but savage oppression, with slavery and all the hold overs that would follow. 


The irish and Jews and bosnians and the polish and all these other cultures that are historically oppressed are typically viewed as inferior because of their culture/religion. But these are strong core beliefs that tie a people together, life rafts in a raging storm. The prisoners in Auschwitz still prayed. 

The strong cultural core beliefs that formed in black America are ones of breaking the mold. That's why unique black names are common place. Slaves were stripped of their names and given their masters surname. Freemen, and their descendants embraced things that they now could control, like their own names.



Idk why I'm ranting so much, but the main point is that it's been studied to death and if you live in a shithole, shithole behavior will become common. ""The feeling of no one cares so fuck it."" And in the US black people by and large where put in the shithole intentionally. So it's hard to blame the concept of the black community for the problems they often face. They're not unique to them.

It doesn't make since to me that you are so unwilling to take a hard look at that.

9079,is9hvp,"You do raise several good points. I will admit that I may have had a bit of a narrow way of thinking on that.

However, considering the riots done by antifa and that lady have both been doing this in the name of BLM, this is what BLM has come to be known for. Much in the same way that what the minority of cops are the reason for what police have come to be known for.

I do believe there needs to be a police reform, since whistle-blowers within the police are known to get punished instead of the bad cops. They need better training.

As for white people, what makes me baffled. Is that antifa who is rioting for BLM is the very same privileged, unemployed white people that BLM appears to be against. Or at least the leader who's apparently not the leader appears to be against.

This is not helped by the state at which Seattle is in where they chased out the white people and spray painted 'white people get the f#*k out' everywhere.

There is also the story of that man who stabbed a white guy repeatedly saying 'black lives matter' because he was just overcome with the need to kill a white person. And the man on FB that posted that Cannon Hinnant had 'his little white privileged brains blown out'. So I apologize if my opinion appears to be a bit biased.

The entire situation is a fustercluck."
9080,is9hvp,"Hi I know this a bit of a delay between comments but I'm just passing through and wanted to address some things.

> However, considering the riots done by antifa and that lady have both  been doing this in the name of BLM, this is what BLM has come to be  known for.  

This may be what you know BLM for, but is not representative of the larger movement. I wouldn't say the westoboro baptist church's displays are what I have come to know Christianity for. In the same vein, don't take the most extreme thing that is over represented in the media to be what the actual movement is, let alone the beliefs of people who support it.

&#x200B;

> As for white people, what makes me baffled. Is that antifa who is  rioting for BLM is the very same privileged, unemployed white people  that BLM appears to be against. Or at least the leader who's apparently  not the leader appears to be against. 

First of all, the comments from Chanelle Helm was more of a spit balling list of things wealthy white people can do, not for everyone. It also isn't some requirement that everyone has to do in order to not be racist. Just a suggestion for those willing to go above and beyond. I don't agree with the list but that is the perspective it's coming from. Also as you said, she is not the leader of the organization. That list is not representative of BLM, just of Helm's personal thoughts.

Either way, BLM is not against white people. There are many places you can look in our society in which the color of your skin can give you an advantage or disadvantage. One of those areas is the way that police interact with black people. The discussion comes up when an innocent person is murdered by police, but the discussion that is had goes beyond that and hopes to address things like profiling, treatment during arrests, higher incarceration rates even when controlling for rates of crimes being committed, harsher sentencing for the same crime, etc.

If a white person supports BLM, it is most likely because they believe these are real issues that affect people, even if it doesn't affect them. It doesn't come from self hatred and it doesn't mean they're going to give up their house.

As for the stabbing, some people are nuts. In my opinion, it would foolish to not support a cause because of people who take it to an extreme"

However there are 2 important points: The sub r/politics which is often brought up with anti-american redditors is an US politics sub but its just called politics and not uspolitics. I bet you 1/3 of the members isn't even american but are still on that sub because its like the main source of news on the popular page.

The other point is that its still much worse in america when it comes to anti-maskers. We had a major incident 3 weeks ago here where 100 out of 30000 protesters stormed the german Bundestag. Difference here is people all know these 100 mostly were retards waving Kaiserreichs flags, U.S. flags and russian flags.

When it comes to US we not just see it on reddit but also on tv, newspaper and everywhere else that the US is handling the COVID-19 crisis bad and that there are a good amount of people not sticking to the rules.

Thats my explanation for it at least. I don't think people are anti-american because its meta to do so but because they are feed on reddit with american news all day because when it comes to the most redditors from a single country then US has the most by far.

>Are you complaining that Americans are complaining about other Americans and not British people? 

No, we're complaining that our media is obscuring the fact that objection to masks appears to be a worldwide phenomenon and not something that's just ""stupid Trump supporters""."

9196,j0alok,It‚Äôs almost scary going into most subs and speaking out. The idiots come out in full force. Hard to believe that many people are that stupid out there
9197,j0alok,"It's more nefarious than that. They use bots to upvote certain submissions at the most opportune times, to create the most powerful political effect. Then they delete submissions that provide counter evidence and context. And there are loads of bots infecting every subreddit in order to maintain narratives. Many major subreddits are completely controlled by propagandists who systematically enforce false narratives, deliberately, and remove any content that challenges those narratives. Also the way the front page of reddit works is specifically designed to minimize the visibility of submissions and subreddits that go against the narrative. 

On /r/canada of all subreddits, Chinese bots that never had any post history posted submission after submission of false stories that the US was seizing medicals supplies from Canada. Canadians absolutely went into psychosis and there were tens of thousands of comments of Canadians acting like the US just declared war on Canada. Comments literally wishing death on Americans and comments saying that Canada should side with China. Every single submission that was later submitted that proved those stories false was downvoted or removed. 

China, and the far left in the western world have an unholy alliance in which they deliberately, systematically employ propaganda on reddit. Reddit is now completely compromised and it has had real world effects in people's perception of reality. A lot of people get all of their news from reddit.

Every single narrative that you see broadcast on reddit widely is specifically designed to have the greatest effect on the minds of the audience. And far-left liberals and the Chinese Communist Party are 100% in cahoots with each other. Their goals are the same. Trump bad. America bad. Violence in the streets is good. China good."

In Ireland, I even passed a pub with a Trump MAGA flag flying from it.  We are also lead to believe that every country lives in perfect harmony.

9212,j0alok,"Thats the thing tho right??? You wanna compare the US to those countries ?? Chile, Peru, Brazil, India are countries were everyone knew its gonna end up bad because the don't have the infrastructure nor the medical possibilities. Spain and Italy were hit hard early and had less time to react than the US but also are known for having an generally older population which caused a much more fatal impact. Especially italy which caused more people to die. 

The countries i have no explanation for are belgium and UK tho. I know from my friend that they don't have a really good medical infrastructure in UK but that doesn't explain the 1/10 death ratio."
9213,j0alok,Totally believable! /s
9214,j0alok,Someone worked out on another post on reddit that if the UK had the same population as the US the deaths would be 197k. So it pretty much is the same death rate per capita just slightly less but not by much!
9215,j0alok,The numbers are a joke.. I know 3 people that were not even seen at the hospital but were told to quarantine and counted as a case. Baylor study (I think) just said that 200k number is at least 30% off. There has been tons of accusations where Doctors were counting anything and everything as a Covid case/death
9216,j0alok,"It shows the poisonous effect of social media when they‚Äôre able to give oxygen to their paranoia, then organise sufficiently to get into groups and actually hold a public demonstration. I‚Äôve no doubt a lot of them feel vindicated when they see other people holding banners that echo their own frustration / sense of a lack of meaning in the world."
9217,j0alok,"The propaganda is hilarious.

Let's get this established. This is what the left actually believes, and will fabricate evidence to support.

If liberals congregate in large groups and destroy property and violently attacking innocent people, I mean FASCISTS, for leftist causes, they are immune from COVID and will not spread it.

If conservatives do anything other than sit at home alone during these times, or go outside and gather, THEY ARE SUPER SPREADERS! AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR GENOCIDE!

If you're not a shill then you need to realize how Orwellian your bullshit is. Also your links require you to go on a scavenger hunt to find any actual legitimate sources for what is claimed, and there are no legitimate sources. It's pure propaganda and is an incredible example of how easy it is to brainwash leftists.

There is zero explanation as to why COVID magically ceases to be a problem when leftists do whatever they want, including destroying their cities and committing terrorism, and that COVID is only spread by large groups when those groups are not radical liberals.

This is absolutely awe-inspiring, Orwellian propaganda. Fucking surreal."
9218,j0alok,"And your point?

Mask up for covid but no mask for the flu? I have no dog in this race, I didn‚Äôt wear a mask for either of them but to give a pass to 80k deaths but force people to mask up for something similar is absolutely stupid. Obviously by the numbers covid appears worse, but 80k people dying is not a drop in the bucket."
9219,j0alok,And you think covid will?

9235,j0alok,"Okay so its sounds like the number on complaint is that
1) your media is not reporting on other countries being stupid and 
2) Reddit is not commenting on other countries being stupid. 

When I say that your American news is way more salient in other countries than vice versa, I mean that that is the reason that ‚Äúeverywhere you look Americans are being called stupid.‚Äù It‚Äôs not because the media is trying to make Americans look stupid- it‚Äôs because the media comments on LITERALLY EVERY major event that happens in America, good and bad. When there are mass protests in the USA for whatever reason, they are covered in the majority of the Western world. So when something big happens in America, the media will cover it. When Americans do something good, trust me they cover it too. The reason you see more American based content in other Western media is because you are the epicentre of Western culture and the only world superpower. Of course we are going to pay attention to you, American pretty well dictates the way the world is going. Why the fuck does Canada matter to you guys?

Go ahead and complain, but you literally said you have BBC on cable. You can watch BBC and they‚Äôll cover British people being idiots too. Guarantee it because I‚Äôve seen it. I watch CBC, I see Canadian people being idiots. 

Realistically, you don‚Äôt get any media information (other than people talking) other than what you search out. Sure, chances are to you American media is much more accessible. But you dont just sit in one spot and have media streamed straight into your brain. You still actively go out and watch it, read it, or listen to it. If you follow American news, subreddits, social media, newspapers, or magazines, you will see American content, but you searched that out still. 

Again, American news stations literally have articles about anti-mask protests in London and abroad.  

(Sorry I couldn‚Äôt link your quotes on mobile).

Edit: Mistyped CBC as CBS."
9236,j0alok,Thats because you‚Äôre probably on American based subreddits AND America is the centre of Western culture. What happens in America happens across the world. Go to Canadian subreddits and you‚Äôll see us complain about stupid Canadians.

The meme literally trying to parody that point. In which case why isn't that what is written? Why isn't this the claim that is presented? Why do I have to do the mental leg work to find out what's even being discussed?

&#x200B;

The left even if you disagree does not engage in this level of obfuscation. They make their assertions loud and proud whether they are right or not. They say ""ACAB"" and own it not ""people in london don't like the police either.""

9239,j0alok,"Yes 100%. The left news will say absolutely anything, the right will ask, ""proof?"" And the left will say nothing.. just anonymous sources.

Thats not how it really works.  Source:  my significant other treats COVID patients and has had to sign many death certificates.

Even if you don't accept that, how do you square the fact that we are showing 200,000+ more deaths so far this year than predicted by previous years - roughly in-line with COVID deaths?"

And if some beancounter from the Admin side of the hospital came to them and said ""Hey, we get paid more if you mark patients as having COVID, so you know, please do that"" you'd have so many whistleblowers (Doctors have a sort of adversarial relationship to Admin in most places).

Even if you don't believe that, how do you square it with the Excess Deaths numbers we're seeing?  Its showing 200,000+ more deaths happening so far this year than what we expected based on previous years.

9281,j0alok,"From your own link, so not more contagious...

‚ÄúSimilarities:
Both COVID-19 and flu can spread from person-to-person, between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Both are spread mainly by droplets made when people with the illness (COVID-19 or flu) cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

It may be possible that a person can get infected by physical human contact (e.g. shaking hands) or by touching a surface or object that has virus on it and then touching his or her own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.

Both flu virus and the virus that causes COVID-19 may be spread to others by people before they begin showing symptoms, with very mild symptoms or who never developed symptoms (asymptomatic).‚Äù"

Not in terms of influence). Sounds like you are disagreeing with all of my points to make your argument sound stronger. 

What I‚Äôm saying is 
1) other countries comment on America because of how important your country is. American comments on other countries less because relatively, they aren‚Äôt as important. 
2) You do have access to international media at your fingertips, you just have to go seek it. Even American news networks will comment on international news. You will get information based on wherever you point your attention. Your media does comment on international matters, you just don‚Äôt necessarily watch/read it."
9288,j0alok,And when I say ‚Äúwhy does Canada matter to you‚Äù I mean in terms of media. Why would the media comment on matters here when there are much larger and more culturally significant matters in the USA? Those issues are clearly going to get primetime in the States
9289,j0alok,"Just start with r/Canada and r/CanadianPolitics. Outside of that, most of our cities have a decent following relative to size but any news usually shows up on the two main. Most of it is liberal as is everything on Reddit, but the majority of Canada‚Äôs population leans progressive as it is. 

As for national news, CBC is government owned but the main source for national news here. Locally, people listen to CTV or Global. CTV is the most central news we have. Global is conservative."
9290,j0alok,"For posterity and myself tell me if you disagree with this statement:

Americans are dumb for not wearing masks but to specify that ""Americans are dumb for not wearing masks"" without mentioning other people not wearing masks around the world is itself evidence of Anti-American sentiment.

&#x200B;

I think that claim, if you agree with it, is suspect because most countries do not have a president and ruling party telling them that ""people disagree on masks"" alluding to the possibility masks aren't effective. Sometimes just saying masks are tyranny.

&#x200B;

This is absolutely still evidence of obfuscation because you should be making the ""real"" point and defending the ""real"" point that reddit is Anti-American, something this post only alludes to. You are like I said signaling at the broader culture point. A hugely dangerous point that democrats and liberals are by extension ""unAmerican.""

While COVID-19 and flu viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, COVID-19 is more contagious among certain populations and age groups than flu.

Conservatives are not the ones going to the streets rioting and looting and they are not the ones calling for the destruction of the of the nuclear family. 

 The endgame of liberal politics, whether deliberate or by association, is the destruction of western society and the establishment of a one world socialist government. There is no other alternative for liberal politics. Thats why people are protesting. People are inherently aware of these policies snowballing into a larger movement against freedom. If these protestors didnt exist, you would have runaway tyranny."

Heart attacks, drug overdoses, and suicides are normal comobidities and not uncommon.

But if you are using this data and including deaths with these comobidities to justify the shut down and increasing the fear then THAT shows how misunderstood these numbers are. 

If  I tested positive for COVID and then on the way home died in a car accident.  Should my death be used to increase the viruses death rate even though I fell into the low risk of death category based on my age and health?

9379,j7jtyn,just LOL'd at my work desk
9380,j7jtyn,Make sure to vote in-person though.
9381,j7jtyn,I think this EVERY time.
9382,j7jtyn,"Fr, they might as well all just say ""Make sure you are registerd to vote for Biden"""
9383,j7jtyn,It Good that more are voting.
9384,j7jtyn,[Make sure to vote!!!...... for my guy](https://youtu.be/vUQ84DufAeM)
9385,j7jtyn,I‚Äôm not 18 yet
9386,j7jtyn,This will be my first time voting for the general elections and I'm confident to vote for Trump
9387,j7jtyn,Sadly I am not old enough to vote yet
9388,j7jtyn,They‚Äôre not doing ‚Äúvote or die‚Äù again?
9389,j7jtyn,"Voter turn out is vital to our republic. If we don't have a full turnout then the system is weaker. 

Your vote for president matters next to nothing, but your state and local vote matter a lot. Vote as often as you are able. Otherwise, you have 0 say in any decisions that are made."
9390,j7jtyn,Yes
9391,j7jtyn,Mailing out my vote tomorrow a.m.
9392,j7jtyn,"Encouraging any support for going  out to vote is going to be great regardless imo. 

I hope that the act of  getting in front of people and telling them that it's worthwhile to take the time to vote will prompt many Americans to start thinking of what is ACTUALLY important to them, like about the issues with enough worth to inspire people to star filling out a ballot. 

Odds are that anybody who is in this country has some STRONG thoughts about how things at large are being run right now, so travelling out to the polls for getting their thoughts out there is good. Engagement of any kind is a noble thing worth appreciating."
9393,j7jtyn,No problem with voters making their own choices. The real problem is voter turnout in this country.
9394,j7jtyn,As a right leaning moderate supporting Biden this year I sincerely hope everyone gets to vote for their candidate of choice so that this election is decided the way it was meant to be.  Let the people choose.  Lets all vote and get behind whoever wins so we can move forward as a Country.
9395,j7jtyn,Never seen something more true
9396,j7jtyn,It's funny 'cos it's true.
9397,j7jtyn,Maybe not the best choice of format lol
9398,j7jtyn,"How can people not vote for the #FREE MONEY PRESIDENT? 

It is mental to think you all don't grasp how more money is the solution to stimulating the economy, more money in the hands of poor people means more production, that means more Jobs, more money.
Universal income would also give a chance for robotix to do more work, how do you not grasp the stable genius? 
##Republicunts more like it."
9399,j7jtyn,"Ahh yes, vote for the party that has done nothing but fuck up America"
9400,j7jtyn,[removed]
9401,j7jtyn,"You get that‚Äôs the point right? There‚Äôs no partisanship in asking people to just vote?

Good god don‚Äôt look now but your persecution complex is showing."
9402,j7jtyn,Except literally nobody cares who you vote for as long as you vote. OP is the only person ascribing a political side to encouraging people to exercise their constitutional right.
9403,j7jtyn,Lame
9404,j7jtyn,[removed]
9405,j7jtyn,"We may not agree but i am glad you are both registered and vote. If we had a 100%eligible voter turnout and my person lost, i would be disappointed but accepting of the outcome because at least it was truly the will of the people and not a portion of the people. 

More people on both sides need to recognize that i may not like your person but that is exactly why we vote and be supportive of young ones starting. To shame either side or prevent some from voting is true decay to our institutions and those people arent patriots they are power hungry and tribalistic. 

Not saying you... i kind of went on a rant lol"
9406,j7jtyn,"This. I voted for Trump in 2020 and in 2016. If more people knew that, they'd wish I wasn't registered to vote."
9407,j7jtyn,"The type of people who only register to vote because Facebook or Instagram or their favorite celebrity told them to are the type of uninformed, apathetic voters we probably don‚Äôt want influencing our elections anyway. Like you said... those who care have been registered for as long as they possibly could be."
9408,j7jtyn,!emojify
9409,j7jtyn,You can register at 16 iirc
9410,j7jtyn,‚Äúoh I‚Äôll be voting alright‚Äù
9411,j7jtyn,"Regardless, it‚Äôs not about that its about the principle. It‚Äôs important for young voters to take advantage of their right to vote and their voices to be heard. You would be amazed in the amount of young people who haven‚Äôt came out to vote in past elections."
9412,j7jtyn,And you probably think he should be able to run for president that long too
9413,j7jtyn,Do you have conservative friends too? This gives me hope lol
9414,j7jtyn,I vote for trump when I was 19 and I have only expanded my political knowledge these last 4 years. I‚Äôm looking forward to 4 more years of Trump and Pence!
9415,j7jtyn,Eyyy fellow 18 year old we exist....
9416,j7jtyn,"Hello, fellow sane person."
9417,j7jtyn,"Well done! I registered when I was 18, but voted for Obama.

At 22 I went Trump, and at 26 am a full fledged Republican."
9418,j7jtyn,"Same, first time coming of age voter for Trump!"
9419,j7jtyn,"In out of touch probably. But can I ask, what issues are you casting your red vote on? I like to keep myself informed as much as possible and I really don‚Äôt hear of younger people voting at all!"
9420,j7jtyn,"I was once laughed out of an interview for a nonpartisan state government job for suggesting that voting registration is a nonpartisan issue. As a young conservative who is excited about registering and voting, how do you feel about the Republican Party's historical and present-day voter exclusion in the name of preventing fraud?"
9421,j7jtyn,"November 4th, 2008 California polls closed at 9:30 pm. I turned 18 on November 5th. I couldnt vote by 2.5 hours. Yeah I got Obama as a birthday present."
9422,j7jtyn,i missed the chance to vote by a month:(. theres always 4 years from now
9423,j7jtyn,"It's too bad you don't live in a blue state. Then you could just show up early and tell them the name of a democrat you know who's registered to vote. With no voter ID laws there's no way for them to call you on your bs.

>!This is sarcasm of course. Voter fraud is bad, mmmkay.!<"
9424,j7jtyn,Because they target you with viagra ads?
9425,j7jtyn,Banned for pointing out flaws in leftist arguments.
9426,j7jtyn,"Yes! So excited that the mission will continue! Pence was amazing last night. I voted Hilary in 2016, but loved Pence and thought he wiped the floor with Kaine. Within just a few months of the election, I saw real results from Trump and that made me do my research into the Clinton political machine and I was horrified. I am proudly voting Trump this time around!"
9427,j7jtyn,Is this sarcasm? Isn‚Äôt it good when people exercise their rights?
9428,j7jtyn,This is AWESOME.
9429,j7jtyn,No it means vote. They want everyone to vote no matter what. If everyone voted democrats would win because they are the majority. Most people will side with democratic policies. Obviously they want you to vote for what you think is best for the country and hope it's Biden.
9430,j7jtyn,What about is implies vote blue instead of just make sure to vote in general?
9431,j7jtyn,"I X it out everywhere and hit ""don't show me these notifications"" and it's literally back an hour later."
9432,j7jtyn,OuR fUtUrE dEpEnDs oN iT!!! <inaudible shrieking>
9433,j7jtyn,"Ohio native here, kinda near Cincy.

I know my anecdotal opinion doesn‚Äôt mean much against the polls, but I‚Äôll be shocked if Trump loses Ohio in the election."
9434,j7jtyn,"If someone is completely out of the loop or completely misinformed why would it be beneficial for them to vote? 

The act of voting is not good in all cases. If a genocidal dictator was voted into office after every citizen cast a vote would you say that voting in that scenario was good? It very much matters how people vote not just that they voted and got a neat ‚ÄúI voted‚Äù sticker to wear."
9435,j7jtyn,Just go vote. You don‚Äôt need ID.
9436,j7jtyn,"same here, it sucks that I can‚Äôt vote this year for Trump but I‚Äôm excited for 2024!"
9437,j7jtyn,Don‚Äôt mail. Vote in person.
9438,j7jtyn,Orange man bad raa raa raa I‚Äôm a real person I promise
9439,j7jtyn,You need a hobby
9440,j7jtyn,Imagine being so triggered that you go through the trouble of registering with the opposite party so you can then go through the trouble of going to their primary so you can cast your insignificant vote and feel like a martyr while having absolutely no say in picking the candidate you actually want to vote for in the general election.
9441,j7jtyn,Lmao imagine being 37 years old and thinking like a petty 12 year old
9442,j7jtyn,Oh I‚Äôm sure lol. ‚ÄúSuch a bad person‚Äù yeeesh at least he hasn‚Äôt tried to set up his political opponents and used the DOJ to hide it + the media to lie about it for 4 years. I‚Äôd rather vote for a distasteful person held accountable by checks and balances than an evil party that actively seeks its ways around them... like court packing.
9443,j7jtyn,Stop being angry all the time. Maybe that‚Äôll help you out
9444,j7jtyn,I just registered to vote after reading your comment
9445,j7jtyn,Good for you
9446,j7jtyn,"Cool, glad to help!"
9447,j7jtyn,This honestly just pissed me off enough to vote Trump. Way to go.

9449,j7jtyn,[removed]
9450,j7jtyn,Wow I just found a person on reddit with moderately liberal views. Should I go buy a lottery ticket?
9451,j7jtyn,I love your view. We can both agree on this. I am Republican and will be voting for trump. You have great thoughts though and we need more people like you
9452,j7jtyn,"That being said, I hope voting is only possible in person."
9453,j7jtyn,"I appreciate your civility, but I have to disagree about wanting 100% of the voting population to actually vote. Like I want as many people to vote as possible, as long as you‚Äôre somewhat educated about the issues. I personally don‚Äôt care what conclusion you come to, I just want voters to have a certain grasp of the issues.

And sadly, not all voters have a true grasp of really any issue."
9454,j7jtyn,"And that‚Äôs a fact. Other liberal lurker here and I pretty much agree with this. My family typically votes R so I don‚Äôt care who you vote for. The only way democracy works is if everyone votes. The only way a democracy to thrive is if everyone is educated. Sadly not much of either here, I‚Äôm hoping this election will change things regardless of who wins"
9455,j7jtyn,Amen
9456,j7jtyn,"Ditto from me.

My grandma is pretty liberal, watches CNN all day, so you can imagine that me and her disagree a lot. She doesn‚Äôt have a car of her own, so she either needs a ride to turn in her ballot or she has to have someone mail it for her.

I don‚Äôt trust mail-in voting. I‚Äôve seen news stories of people just dumping ballots into ditches, and I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe to trust one‚Äôs voice in such a vulnerable system. So I‚Äòve convinced my grandma not to mail in her ballot because I want her vote to be as safe as possible, and I‚Äôve promised to take her to our townhall so she can turn in her ballot personally.

Could I sabotage her vote? Sure. All I‚Äôd have to do is convince her to mail it in, she‚Äôd give it to me to put in the mailbox for her, and I could do whatever I wanted with that ballot. Would I ever do such a thing? Of course not. It would be downright immoral and unamerican to sabotage another citizen‚Äôs voice in such a way. I really don‚Äôt want her guy to win, but I would never try to take away her vote in an effort to make sure he loses. I want her voice to be heard so that whoever wins is decided by all of the people who wanted to contribute to making that choice."
9457,j7jtyn,"Naw. Society is better when everyone has skin in the game even if I don‚Äôt agree with their choices.

The goal is to increase societal cohesiveness and that means a high level of participation across many areas of civic engagement."
9458,j7jtyn,Not necessarily true. I'm 27 and just registered to vote. I did not pay attention to politics that much until this year...
9459,j7jtyn,"Holy shit. It has been bugging the hell out of me and I couldn't quite put my finger on why. I know they mean ""get out and vote (blue)"" but I always wondered who the hell it is they're actually pandering to. Now it fits perfectly with the lefts target demographics. Old enough to vote, young enough to be heavily influenced by celebrity, not involved enough to have full grasp of issues but not quite too old to have seen their tactics play out enough to have perspective. You sir, just blew my mind."
9460,j7jtyn,[removed]

9463,j7jtyn,"You‚Äôd honestly be surprised at how many young conservatives there are. Most just don‚Äôt flaunt it around, just graduated from college and most people I know are Republicans. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm from the South but they‚Äôre out there."
9464,j7jtyn,"mmm, maybe. I don't have many friends who are close enough to discuss politics with, but I live in a fairly conservative area and so I suspect I'm not the only one. From what I gather I'm in the minority of the peers I usually engage with though. But again, I don't know for sure."
9465,j7jtyn,"Im 17, and honestly kinda upset this election couldn‚Äôt happen just a year later so I could get my vote in for Trump. My mother is a crazy leftist and would hate that, but my dad‚Äôs voting Trump."
9466,j7jtyn,"If you base your opinion on how many are voting Trump on Reddit you‚Äôd think Biden would win in a landslide. Hell, in the gif chat I said that someone needs to brace themselves because it‚Äôll be a long 4 more years for them when Trump wins and they banned me from the room. Lol. Gif chat??? Really??"
9467,j7jtyn,"I and all my friends are conservatives in NYC. The Orthodox Jewish community in NYC generally leans right, 99% of the time at least."
9468,j7jtyn,I‚Äôm 20 years old and most (though not all) of my friends are conservatives. Many of my cousins are also conservatives.
9469,j7jtyn,"Not sure ‚Äôbout him but I‚Äôm 21, and I‚Äôve got a brother who‚Äôs 18. He, I and most of our friends are pretty conservative."
9470,j7jtyn,"Sadly, it‚Äôs a thing that people my age often don‚Äôt vote. I honestly don‚Äôt care what side they are on, I want to see more of my peers voting simply because it‚Äôs a patriotic duty. 

As far as why I‚Äôm Conservative, I don‚Äôt much  like talking about politics on the internet but well, I commented here so it‚Äôs only fair that I briefly answer an honest, open  question. I don‚Äôt believe socialism is a good plan for America. I want to see the economy boosted and jobs created for all Americans. 2nd amendment rights are a big one for me. I want citizens to be able to defend themselves in their own homes. I am tired of seeing all the hypocritical race-baiting from the political left. They don‚Äôt really care about the minorities they talk about so much except to use them as a prop to gain votes. By contrast conservative politicians  actively create jobs and push for proper education for minorities.   I believe that the Republican Party, despite its many flaws,  is currently the party that will best advance freedom."
9471,j7jtyn,"So any attempts to prevent fraud is ""voter exclusion""?"

It's why libertarians infuriate me so much now, if libertarianism worked we wouldn't have this wealth divide that is growing larger instead of shrinking.

I'm a huge fan of a government for and by the people and we havent been that in decades, we've been the voices of loud minorities on both sides and how the true middle isnt outraged at this is a failure by us not our government nor business"

9490,j7jtyn,"...but probably gonna be drunk or high that day, sooooo"
9491,j7jtyn,Not sure what you‚Äôre getting at. That conservative Americans are uninformed and apathetic? Do you usually go into right-leaning places just to make fun of right-leaning people? Odd pastime.
9492,j7jtyn,I wanted to test it out and this was below the post I saw it on my home page.
9493,j7jtyn,"You're*****,  you fuckin emoji-ing psychopath."
9494,j7jtyn,It just really depends where you live. There are many young conservatives in the rural and suburban midwest.
9495,j7jtyn,I‚Äôm a republican and young. You are correct we don‚Äôt flaunt it. There‚Äôs too many of our generation that will get angry at you for being republican. The younger you are the worse it is to be republican nowadays. It‚Äôs kept secret.
9496,j7jtyn,"Thanks for answering. I do however honk the socialism thing is overblown. The entire way the economy runs isn‚Äôt going to change in 4 years, otherwise I feel you."
9497,j7jtyn,I'm not sure I understand your question. What is an example of an effort to prevent voter fraud that doesn't entail voter exclusion?
9498,j7jtyn,"I won‚Äôt, I‚Äôve filled out a hypothetical ballot doing research on all the candidates, including house, attorney general etc. 

And my CD is the only swing district in my state so I have an obligation to vote on it

9500,j7jtyn,Same thing happens to me on r/conservative üôÄüôÄüôÄ I am oppressed!!!! I am the victim!!!!!1!1!!!
9501,j7jtyn,"seeing is believing, why don‚Äôt you give it a try?"
9502,j7jtyn,So you don't want more people to exercise their right to vote?
9503,j7jtyn,It has been said in the past though. They aren't somehow silently influencing voters to vote blue. The reason is just because the more people that vote the higher chance the democrats have of winning. And vice versa.
9504,j7jtyn,"Honestly what do you want me to say? You can insult us all you want we‚Äôre still going to vote for Trump, not because we like him, but because he will pass the policy‚Äôs we agree with.

Just vote for you who you want and realize that the people who vote differently from you, don‚Äôt do it out of hate but because we genuinely think the person we‚Äôre voting for is the best choice, same exact reason why you vote"
9505,j7jtyn,"I agree. This whole meme is such a straw man. There are very few if any democrats that would be upset to hear about a republican excercising their constitutional right to vote. We just want the will of the people to be heard. I think most of us do not believe the will of the people was heard in 2016 due to the relatively low voter turnout. 

Regardless of our political affiliations, we should encourage everyone to get out and vote, and we should be furious about attempts to stop or dissuade voters like the governor of Texas limiting ballot drop boxes or calls to push back the start of early voting."
9506,j7jtyn,The fine isn‚Äôt enough money for anyone to care about. And without a two party system many people can vote for parties and their vote essentially won‚Äôt count for the parties they vote for unless it‚Äôs one of the major parties. It‚Äôs good in some ways but it‚Äôs also confusing and a waste of time for those who don‚Äôt care about which major party is elected.
9507,j7jtyn,"So you want to make voting forceful ? 

That‚Äôs not very democratic..."
9508,j7jtyn,We sure do. No holiday though.

9518,j7jtyn,"I've seen numerous ""blue check"" content creators make passionate videos about getting registered to vote only to flip out when someone agrees and states they are voting for Trump. So there's that.

Also, the will of the people was heard. It just so happens the majority of Americans' will was they didn't care who was elected, for whatever reason. A no vote is still a vote, you are just voting absent. As someone who didn't vote in 2016 but is voting for Trump this year, that's my take on it."
9519,j7jtyn,"> There are very few if any democrats that would be upset to hear about a republican excercising their constitutional right to vote. 

Hard disagree.

I think many democrats are now irate that people would vote for Trump.

Look...I remember seeing the left positively giddy that the ""boomer remover"" was going to kill Trump voters.

And regarding the ballot drop boxes:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/texas-governor-defends-limiting-counties-to-one-ballot-drop-box

In a court filing Wednesday, Abbott said he put the limit in place because counties that planned to use multiple drop box sites would have ‚Äúinconsistent safeguards to preserve the integrity of the election, such as a lack of poll watchers overseeing ballot deliveries.‚Äù The governor, echoing claims by President Donald Trump, claims that vote-by-mail fraud has been a ‚Äúfrequent and enduring problem in Texas,‚Äù according to the filing."

9529,j7jtyn,"I see your point but voting is optional. I‚Äôm in support of encouraging people to vote, but completely against forcing people to vote."
9530,j7jtyn,"There‚Äôs nothing democratic about forcing people to do anything..... 

I find it incredibly unconstitutional. 

What‚Äôs the point of freedom if you‚Äôre forced to do things you may not want to do?"

""Be sure you're registered to vote"" is about all ya got right now and most of this thread hates seeing it all the time and has been said for decades and hasn't improved anything"
9537,j7jtyn,"Well that's not bad at least, I'm amazed more places dont early vote"
9538,j7jtyn,"I dunno, I wouldn‚Äôt consider hatred or disdain to be ‚Äúinterest‚Äù. Maybe substitute trolling for seeking positive interests? I mean, as opposed to insulting people you disagree with... well, at least to their faces in their spaces"
9539,j7jtyn,"I mean you should be able to point out the flaws in leftist arguments if you are one or left leaning. Otherwise you don‚Äôt really understand what you‚Äôre wrapping your moral and political identity to, since for leftists they are one in the same."
9540,j7jtyn,[deleted]
9541,j7jtyn,Yeaaaaaaaaaa I still can‚Äôt get behind the idea of forcing the citizens of a country to vote. That‚Äôs just not what the United States of America is about.

9546,j7jtyn,"Yeah, I know. I‚Äôm personally of the opinion that ‚Äúsafe‚Äù spaces ought to exist so there can be places for like-minded people to gather and converse without excessive ridicule. Most of Reddit would ridicule right-leaning discussion, but here we have a space that is tolerant of it. Of course, it‚Äôs still not a perfect ‚Äúsafe‚Äù space... since you‚Äôre here... but I‚Äôm not saying you should be forcibly removed either. I‚Äôm just suggesting this may not be the best place for you to be, for your sake or ours. It‚Äôs like why come here solely to be contrarian? You can do that in so many other places, why here, why bother?

The idea of ‚Äúsafe‚Äù spaces should not be demonized as ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù behavior. The problem is when you try to make EVERYWHERE a safe space as a means of excluding a whole side of the aisle. But it‚Äôs not... there are Democrat subs. Anyway, that‚Äôs just my opinion."
9547,j7jtyn,"Hahahahaha. You suck your own dick with that mouth? To the point, tell me about the flaws in your own argument, troll."
9548,j7jtyn,Fuck I got to remember to stop feeding these trolls.

9551,j6d2hx,Stage 6 TDS
9552,j6d2hx,Did someone actually put this in your mailbox?! How disgusting!
9553,j6d2hx,This letter is literally one of the most despicable things I‚Äôve ever seen.
9554,j6d2hx,"However you‚Äôve identified yourself to this person, ramp it up 10x now that they have a problem with it. 

Extra signs extra stickers etc. 

Don‚Äôt let them silence you. That‚Äôs exactly what this is intended to do. What terrible people."
9555,j6d2hx,"I am confused.  I take it this wasn't written by a Trump supporter, but it starts ""As a Trump supporter, I..."".  Grammatically terrible letter. üò£"
9556,j6d2hx,"I bet they didn't sign that ""letter"""
9557,j6d2hx,I would just get more Trump signs for my yard . And bigger ones .

Liberals today: ‚Äúok this time he‚Äôll definitely do the dictator stuff we promise‚Äù"
9560,j6d2hx,But they couldn‚Äôt say it to your face apparently. This is some pettiness.

9562,j6d2hx,Left: is this Tolerance?
9563,j6d2hx,"And i want to thank you for identifying yourself as: A patriot, Supporting the Constitution, Supporting the 2A, Supporting a good economy, Supporting Law enforcement, Supporting Military, Not supporting the dangerous mob, and supporting the fight against the Deep State. You must be a great neighbor."

9566,j6d2hx,Lmfao ‚Äúwhere were you during democracy at risk 2020‚Äù. So many people have lost their damn minds. This is a direct result of 24hr media sitting in your pocket
9567,j6d2hx,Wow the left sure are tolerant *sarcasm*
9568,j6d2hx,"Just because I would probably be skeptical if someone from the left posted this but with the roles reversed, I have to be somewhat skeptical of this. Not saying it isn‚Äôt real, but it would obviously be easy to print."
9569,j6d2hx,That‚Äôs the literal definition of racism. In this case ascribing qualities to somebody based solely on political affiliation instead of skin color.
9570,j6d2hx,Too stupid to even respond to.  Like the vast majority of Democrats.  Buy more ammo.
9571,j6d2hx,This is disgusting
9572,j6d2hx,I was called a racist asshole by a long time acquaintance because I pointed out that the Proud Boys President was black therefore could not be a white supremacist organization.  We live in Bizarro world.
9573,j6d2hx,Must be an r/politics mod.
9574,j6d2hx,"In contrast, you know what my reaction to my neighbors having a Biden sign was? ""Oh ok"" *moves on with my life*"
9575,j6d2hx,That‚Äôs disgusting. Trying to use God to make themselves look righteous and pure? How hideous.
9576,j6d2hx,Woah... crazytown
9577,j6d2hx,"You know the new narrative has been ""everything is at risk this election."" 

Do they really think no ones ever said that before? They say that every time a conservative has a chance of winning.

Elections during Vietnam War? During the entirety of the Cold War? During the Industrial Revolution? The Civil War?"
9578,j6d2hx,It seems to me that white supremacy means not being ashamed of being white. That's real Orwellian.
9579,j6d2hx,Isnt this voter intimidation?
9580,j6d2hx,"Yeah, like those signs that claim hate has no home here. LOL!"
9581,j6d2hx,"I would put so much trump stuff in my yard after this. Not a single blade of grass will be visible, as it will all be covered in Trump signs and banners. I will force this fucker to look at something that says Trump on it every single second of every single day."
9582,j6d2hx,You should bring this to the police. They might be able to dust for prints. This letter is a threat!

9587,j6d2hx,"Imagine if the Right did this - letters condemning the riots and Marxist radicalism on a mass scale. The media would eat it right up.

""Tremendous new wave of hate speech mailed to countless innocent homes. Something HAS to be done about this surge in racism across the country, and it has to be BIG."""
9588,j6d2hx,"Funny how the Bible teaches about tolerance for people who disagree with you, and the people who wrote this seem to be the most intolerant people I have seen actually claiming to be christian."
9589,j6d2hx,The mind boggling brainwashing from rotten leftist neighbors like this is unfathomable. Honestly.
9590,j6d2hx,If someone left this on my door or in my mailbox I would walk into my front yard and burn it in my driveway while blaring ‚ÄúProud to be an American‚Äù
9591,j6d2hx,The left has lost it

9595,j6d2hx,"The word ""racist"" has entirely lost its meaning thanks to liberals"
9596,j6d2hx,"There are legitimate people out there who are victims of racism or hate crimes. But no one ever takes those people seriously because leftists have cried wolf so much that words like ‚Äúracism‚Äù don‚Äôt have the serious meaning they used to. Which is bad. 

SJWs ultimately hurt racism victims."
9597,j6d2hx,They are a funny bunch those liberals

9604,j6d2hx,That is fucking wild!
9605,j6d2hx,"I must of misread this. Sounded like the writer was admitting to being a Trump supporter and then naming his/her reasons. Which is even more confusing, because if a person is actually racist, why would they want Trump?"
9606,j6d2hx,I‚Äôm confused by this
9607,j6d2hx,I would totally double down on this and start holding satanic rituals in my back yard.
9608,j6d2hx,‚ÄúWhere were you when our democracy was at risk?‚Äù Denouncing and sending feds in to handle the rioters that burned down the city while the guy you supported did and said nothing about it

9610,j6d2hx,They did it anonymously what a pussy
9611,j6d2hx,"Any signature?  I‚Äôm guessing not. If you‚Äôre not willing to put yourself out there and let me know who you are, your opinion means absolutely nothing to me"
9612,j6d2hx,"How do you fk up the alignment of 3 bullet points?  I'm immediately irked by that.  On top of that the sentence structure is trash, the theme is cliche and the prose is horrendous.  They lack the capacity to use simple punctuation properly.  There's even an open quote.

If it were me I would send it back with corrections in red marker and a ""3/10 See me after class""."
9613,j6d2hx,"I just cant understand how any Christian can side with Democrats. They see murdering unborn babies as perfectly fine and homosexuality as something to be celebrated. Both of those things are core parts of the party beliefs, than when you take into account all of there actions the look like devel worshipers."
9614,j6d2hx,Crazy how some people live in absolute backwards realities
9615,j6d2hx,"In the words of John Doyle: Democracy is cringe, go read some Aristotle."

9625,j6d2hx,Just send them a reply with something like: ‚ÄúThank you for identifying yourself as someone suffering from TDS.‚Äù
9626,j6d2hx,Claims democracy is at risk while trying to suppress Trump supporters. The hypocrisy is inconceivable.
9627,j6d2hx,That‚Äôs why they are known as the loony left
9628,j6d2hx,I'm sure whoever received this immediately decided to vote blue.
9629,j6d2hx,They capitalized white supremacy.  It must be pretty important to them.

I opposed the coup against the elected president by the FBI/DNC who abused the steele dossier.

I opposed the packing of the supreme court

I opposed the silencing of one side of the political spectrum by the majority of social media platforms

I opposed the removal of the electoral college

I opposed the addition of states to stack the senate

I opposed the intentional attempt at delegitimizing the election with mail in ballot complications

I opposed the violent, racist, anarchocommunist uprising (BLM and Antifa) and attempts at created breakaway states which were a harbor of extreme levels of violence and rape (CHAZ)

Where the fuck were you, democrat?"
9636,j6d2hx,Did they put this in the mailbox. That's federal crime.
9637,j6d2hx,Libtards.
9638,j6d2hx,Wow you love to see what people really mean when they talk about tolerance! The true colors are showing!
9639,j6d2hx,They may as well written ‚ÄúMay Baal have mercy on your souls‚Äù
9640,j6d2hx,Hopefully they signed it so they know which neighbor is the douche nozzle.
9641,j6d2hx,I‚Äôm pretty sure that the God they reference at the bottom isn‚Äôt happy with dismembering babies alive while they‚Äôre in their mothers‚Äô wombs.  Just who should God have mercy on?
9642,j6d2hx,This attitude is why I'm afraid to advertise as much an American flag. It makes you a target to half the people driving by.

9655,j6d2hx,Didn't people used to (and still) do this to people who fly the pride flag?
9656,j6d2hx,So if supporting our president makes you a racist then supporting Biden makes you a pedophile
9657,j6d2hx,Disgusting.
9658,j6d2hx,Gaslighting
9659,j6d2hx,This sounds like something that an irreligious liberal would think appeals to a religious person.
9660,j6d2hx,And of course their punctuation is awful.
9661,j6d2hx,Huh. Funny when they do this and say they have hatred. But yet what they did was purely out of hatred.
9662,j6d2hx,I would take that letter and get it turned into a giant sign and then put another sign next to it that says who sent it and that this is why you are voting for Trump. Call them out so everyone in the neighborhood can see.
9663,j6d2hx,That‚Äôs a sign that you‚Äôre doing the right thing!
9664,j6d2hx,It‚Äôs so obvious they are getting this garbage from Rachel maddow. She keeps spouting off conspiracy level bs about how we are fighting against democracy when in reality they are fighting for communism which is the antithesis of democracy.

9672,j6d2hx,is this a joke. the far left individuals in this country have genuinely lost their minds.
9673,j6d2hx,These people are delusional. I used to think TDS was just some stupid saying die hard trump supporters would say. But the left has really shown to actually have TDS.
9674,j6d2hx,"This doesn‚Äôt concern me too much, but I know people who are afraid to voice a political opinion on Facebook because they don‚Äôt want to get fired!

You are the side which is rejecting the US democratic process, your 2016 candidate is telling your 2020 non-candidate to not concede the election under any circumstances. 

Sure, Trump isn‚Äôt saying that he will concede if he loses. But your side is actively campaigning to never accept a loss. Being non-committal is one thing, making not conceding a part of your platform is a whole new level of democratic obstructionism"

He was one of the loudest birthers and is pulling similar shit against Kamala, questioning her eligibility. 

He called Mexicans rapists and assumed some are good people. 

He employed Stephen Miller as his senior advisor, who is an outspoken white nationalist. Actually the sketchy racists who have passed through his staff are too many to mention...like Bannon who believes in a holy war against the islamic faith.

He has created what are essentially dark-sites for internment and terrorization of latin-american refugees and immigrants using really shady contractors. 

There are too many reports to mention from people close to him on both sides of the ticket where he says plain racist shit, like ""nigerians wont want to return to their huts when they see america"", but since those are just accounts we can leave them be. 

The pocahontas affair was also really racist. Like once he tweeted at Warren ""see you on the TRAIL"", which is a really dark nod to the trail of tears genocide. He does those nods to his racist base all the time, and things have just gotten buried because it has been a 4 year long dumpster fire of him aggravatig ""the libs"".

He has called the virus the kung flu and other objectively racist and stigmatizing names.

He says he wants immigrants from Norway (where I'm from), which means he wants white ppl. Trust me, nobody in their right mind in Norway would even set foot in your country. He has pretty much destroyed your standing with all your allies. Even the far right in Norway more or less condemns him. But usa is still an important country, so we all pay attention, unfortunately.

Another aspect is not what he does directly himself, but the behaviour among his supporters that he at best does nothing to quell and at worst encourages.

His life before the presidency is also full of racism, but we don't have to consider that either."

9940,j6d2hx,Yup! Joe‚Äôs the POSTER CHILD for that!!
9941,j6d2hx,"No I would check it based off multiple other media outlets to guess its validity and voracity as anyone who consumed media critically should. Problem is, if you send me a link from Brietbart which has a clear agenda and bias, and that's literally the only media outlet with that info, then it's likely either manufactured from whole cloth by breigtbart, or not large enough in scale to fall on the radar of other media outlets.

This conspiracy that conservative thought is being systematically purged, is nonsense. Conservative media operates at a very high level, fox is the number one cable news network, and conservative talk radio dominates.

Here is the biggest issue, and why you don't see a whole lot of conservative views in what I'm sure you would consider liberal media. Most of the issues conservatives are concerned about revolve around cultural shifts. Shifts from a rural white economic conservative values, to a more metropolitan, egalitarian society, which is happening, the only difference is perspective. Most people in this country feel this shift is a good thing, conservatives by definition want to preserve the power and cultural balance of the past. Liberal media reflects this dynamic. Simply put most media outlets don't take the war on Christmas, and the urbanization of the suburbs seriously. Also the whataboutism is getting more and more tired especially when the court system, senate, and executive branch are controlled by conservatives, so the concept of Obama or Hillary being anything other than irrelevant in politics in so far as they have any impact, will be ignored by journalistic outlets with any credibility.

So no I won't outright reject evidence you provide, but I sure won't take it at face value without finding more evidence to back the claim up. The fact that you can't find any source leads me to believe you either feel your information is correct, or you got duped by a disinformation campaign. Fake news is real, only finding one source is a red flag for that, not a conspiracy. To be fair fake news is on both sides but from my experience is more prevalent on the right, but I have found left propaganda and dismissed it as I do the right. My advise to you is to examine your media diet more closely and don't echo Facebook memes without checking the voracity of the concept they talk about, there is a real organized effort to manipulate and divide us as a country, we need to stick together and get better at eliminating the Bs.

We've now lost more than died in WWI and the Korean war together. 

We can fill the largest stadium in America almost 2 times with the people that we've lost.

Please think of it as more than how many will survive. Show some empathy and think about all the families that lost someone. Think of it in terms of people that are grieving. Contemplate that something like a 336,000 people lost an immediate family member (average family size of 3 and 168,000+ deaths). 

Now let's follow the guidance to reduce the number of people that will grieve in the future. Empathy and compassion for people we don't know. Not just privileges for those of us not impacted.

We should be out colonizing worlds and instead we have to be here, bickering about what the value of melonin in someone's skin is. 

Let me answer the question for you because you don't seem to get it. What is the value of melonin? Zero. Ziltch. Nada. Nothing. It's worth nothing. Let's get over this social justice nonsense so we can actually improve this country and conquer the stars, instead of moving backwards."

Time to turn the tables and with care and skillful application ensure that no one is above or below the law.  A truly equal and fair society requires constant work and attention.

10418,i9883m,"Do you guys know what a troll is? It‚Äôs just a bait that you fell for. He‚Äôs just saying something and terrible hoping someone will give home some sort attention. The fact that you‚Äôre using this as a justification for being republican is pointless. 
If someone cheered on the death of George Floyd I would realize they are just doing it for attention, not post it on reddit presenting it as a normal republican."

In fact, I would go as far to say that BLM HATES guys who do and comment this shit because it takes away from their message.

10461,i9883m,"Blm means 3 things. 1. The clear truth that black lives matter in this country (they 100% do). 2. The idea that America is systemically racist and the only way to change the past is by canceling everything that doesn‚Äôt fit their narrative. 3. Finally, it means defunding our phenomenal police that (99.99% of) help their communities all around the country

All Lives Matter means 1 thing. The simple idea that all men (and women of course) are created equally under the eyes of the lord. We believe in the amendments and our constitution, the abolishment of slavery and the pursuit of happiness for all in this great country"
10462,i9883m,"Why are people still using the words ""Black"" and ""White"" people,  when it was Democrats who  used those two words to seperate us. I use it also but I try not too cause we are all Americans first. Not black or white people cause there is no such thing, I don't thank white people for America. I thank the British for America,  without Great Britain we would not have the founding fathers we do have in America. Anyhow, the point is we are all Americans first and last. What happened here, was a injustice and for these people to celebrate the death of a young American who knew not the world he was born into is severely sad. They see only red, though their ancestors were slaves for 250 years in our country. The institutions of slavery was 400 years but black people in America were enslaved for only two centuries. Why, aren't people talking about this well it helps the Leftist agenda that they always had since it's founding to create division in the nation."

Scum is scum no matter the color. If you are excited that a 5 year old child was executed then you are scum, plain and simple. To keep this thought clean we should track down every person who feels this way and ship them to Antarctica."
10482,i9883m,That's freaking psycho blacks don't have beef with white people of today. It's the white democrats of the past and of today black democrats too. The enemy of Americans in general is the Democratic party.

10484,i9883m,"At this point I'm almost willing to believe this is some massive psy-op AGAINST Republicans, because I can not believe there would be a thread full of real people seeing this and just deciding to tee off on blacks, dems and leftists without ONE comment asking for a source on the crime, let alone comments, beyond a screenshot of a facebook post from 'waynedupree dot com'. Irresponsible, irrational, and any real human beings here, on the clock or not, should give their head a shake that this sort of thing is even being pushed high enough to be visible WITHOUT any such questions being asked & answered."

10486,i9883m,My blood is boiling.
10487,i9883m,"I feel like part of the problem with this is that the headline highlights the race of both of the people involved. It doesn‚Äôt matter that the child was white and it doesn‚Äôt matter that his killer was black, a horrible crime was committed and that is what is important. I feel articles like this come out all the time with the intention of stirring the pot. I think it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in things and direct your anger at another group of people, regardless of race. Racism gives people a physical enemy to direct hate and anger at. The media is feeding people‚Äôs desire to direct their anger at another group of people. There is NO justification for celebrating the death of a murdered child and the people who commented should feel ashamed of themselves and take a good hard look at their values as they are exactly the same as white supremacists. It also must be noted that these two people don‚Äôt speak for all black people, all Democrats, or all of the BLM. Loud and dangerous minority that exists in every political sector, and BLM is no exception."
10488,i9883m,"Ok. Coming from an outside point of view (outside your party, and your country), why are you all calling BLM the new KKK. Not all of them are racist, and the original idea was a movement for equality and maybe not having the Police kill people. Why do so many of you immediately jump to ""New KKK"" and ""gotta bug guns/ammo"" and the sort?"

10591,i9883m,"This killing is absolutely disgusting but how can you not remember when the officers got arrested? It was after the protests started. 

There‚Äôs room to discuss if it should still be going on, but to pretend like those are really comparable is just being intellectually dishonest with yourself."
10592,i9883m,Yessir.
10593,i9883m,"Unfortunately, there is already evidence that some people are full of hatred and biogtry as seen in that one case where a mother's boyfriend stomped on her baby who was white. All in the meanwhile saying Blacklivesmatter.   


You could be right that it might be trolling, but I doubt Russia needs to start more trolling as America is tearing itself up without the help of Russia."
10594,i9883m,Say no more.

10603,i9883m,">You guys act like the left defends terrible crimes like this.

They do.

>You‚Äôre all just nuts.

Says who?  The ones defending and excusing crimes like this?

>Jesus Christ, I can‚Äôt understand how you guys don‚Äôt see that you‚Äôre spinning this to your narrative.

Stop saying stupid, crazy shit.  Then we'll have a lot less to talk about."
10604,i9883m,The incident is real. The Facebook posts are questionable.
10605,i9883m,"r/conservative has an article up about it. I was sent these screenshots by a friend, and this isn't some thing against republicans. I am very much a republican and conservative."
10606,i9883m,"Because they are fed bullshit through their choice of media, they choose to believe it because it's what they *want* to believe."
10607,i9883m,show us all a modern conservative celebrating the death of anyone to this level or dgree.
10608,i9883m,"They do, AND they did!"
10609,i9883m,That's what I was trying to say but everyone is too triggered to be discerning
10610,i9883m,"These screenshots were sent to me, thought I'd share."
10611,i9883m,Brilliant people over here at r/Republican. This guy still thinks races are actually a thing. You need science.
10612,i9883m,"I don‚Äôt think they are trolls but you know what? Dumb assholes are always a thing.. every race, political stance, gender, sexuality has some."
10613,i9883m,"Yes, yes they are."
10614,i9883m,So many bad people just like the ones being pointed out here.
10615,i9883m,">I hope it is obvious that this is not a left vs right issue,  or even a race issue.

It is a race issue when you have commentators on facebook as seen in the picture taking joy from the fact that the kid who was killed  was white."
10616,i9883m,Mass transit doesn‚Äôt make it to the ‚Äòburbs lmao
10617,i9883m,This craziness pushed me hard to the conservative side.
10618,i9883m,He must be trying to get a job at cnn or with nick cannon.  Stay armed people
10619,i9883m,I'm voting for the first time this year and before the events of the past few months I definitely wasn't a conservative.
10620,i9883m,"I'm liberal. I believe in BLM. And I believe those comments are fucked up. The dude should never leave prison, ever."
10621,i9883m,"A lot is wrong with these people. But that doesn‚Äôt make them representative of democrats, liberals, etc. Just as one bad cop doesn‚Äôt make them all bad"
10622,i9883m,"Weird that people incorporate personalities and politics, I mean like the people saying that shit likely have no clue what they are they just think they are 'thugggin' or some thing. To be like wow that person said something crazy I bet he is blah blah so I am blah blah is the wrong way to think imo"
10623,i9883m,They say the same shit. Neither side is free of terrible people.
10624,i9883m,Go check out the comments on breitbart...it‚Äôs awful on both sides I assure you.
10625,i9883m,I'm sorry but how does two extreme examples taken from a comment section lead to you being a conservative republican? You can find insane comments from either side.
10626,i9883m,ThIs is WhY i'M a HuMaN PerSoN.
10627,i9883m,"This in particular. Not political issues, not economic issues. just what stupid people say on the internet. I can just look at some neonazi or white supremacist group all republicans with them and say this is why im a leftist."
10628,i9883m,"Amen. 

Disgusting animals."
10629,i9883m,"Do you actually believe any majority of any human group agrees with these low level Facebook comments?

The majority of the left does not say align with these comments. Just like the majority of the right isn‚Äôt nazis.

I mean Jesus Christ does someone really have to tell you this? How brainwashed by Facebook comments are you?"
10630,i9883m,"Nobody on any part of the political spectrum is ok with those posts.  It's not just Conservative Republcans.

Those people are exceptionally aberrant.  

Just as the views held in Matt Shea's manifesto urging supporters to kill all males who do not yield to the authority of God does not represent Conservative Republcans, these monsters do not represent Democrats."
10631,i9883m,"I work with 2 conservative Republicans who have literally said the same things about BLM protesters. The problem here isn‚Äôt race, it‚Äôs hate. I agree the two comments above are wretched, but any positive sentiment made innocent death is horrible."
10632,i9883m,Where the fuck are all these white nationalists? Like all 5 of them?
10633,i9883m,"At this point, I almost don't even care if it happens."
10634,i9883m,"When the majority of them think that way, you can‚Äôt ignore it."
10635,i9883m,"If it is, they got the speech patterns right."
10636,i9883m,You might think so ... but when that guy in Alexandria shot at Republicans I saw an abhorrent amount of Americans take to Facebook under their own identities to say that Republicans deserve to be shot.
10637,i9883m,That‚Äôs not even true
10638,i9883m,"I inferred the ""they"" was Democrats/liberals. Interesting how you immediately assumed black people. Also, screws saying POC, might as well call them ""colored people"" like old school racists, you just rearrange the words."
10639,i9883m,Kinda like how you all group cops together as racists. Or all white people are racist. Or all conservatives as racists. It amazes me how little self awareness the left has.
10640,i9883m,"It‚Äôs not race based, and it‚Äôs rather telling that you jump to that conclusion first.

It‚Äôs ideology based. This is the behavior Marxism tacitly encourages."
10641,i9883m,or days
10642,i9883m,"Yeah it‚Äôs looking really pessimistic sometimes I wonder what I‚Äôll tell my kids or grandkids about how we let America die to these people
At least we can say we fought them"
10643,i9883m,I like you‚Äôre name and flair combo.
10644,i9883m,"I mean, they‚Äôre animals."
10645,i9883m,"Well, without conducting a dissertation....

Hollywood has glorified violence in their movies, notably the Purge Series, and more recently The Hunt.  Which was actually a movie about liberals hunting conservatives for sport.  But there are many others.
Actors and other celebrities are falling all over themselves to virtue signal that they are woke, by apologizing for every thought crime they have ever been associated with and align themselves with every cause that comes out.

The Main Stream Media pushes the false narrative of white privileges.  Puts white on black crime under a microscope, while ignoring black on white, and black on black crimes.  This does nothing but divide the country and enrage the black population into thinking that they are unfairly targeted and assaulted.

The Democrat politicians condone the violence and destruction, which embolden the black population to take actions such as this without fear of consequences."
10646,i9883m,No no no... just my expectation of how a conversation with them would go. Ill add the /s
10647,i9883m,No. He used /s which indicates sarcasm
10648,i9883m,W... what?
10649,i9883m,"Yeah these riots are getting out of control, they are destroying a once beautiful America"
10650,i9883m,Sorry. I shall give myself a thorough flogging. Starting at the penis.
10651,i9883m,"They are crippled with anxiety over the proper use of apostrophes, and use such shortcuts to avoid deciding."
10652,i9883m,Done
10653,i9883m,Bring mana
10654,i9883m,Only pink ones
10655,i9883m,"He never specified who the real racist is, your racist mind presumed. Not everything is against you"
10656,i9883m,"Yea, I never said only one side can be racist. That‚Äôs your racist mindset jumping the gun there. People like you are what‚Äôs wrong with our country today. Instead of asking questions and having dialogue you made up your own version on what you thought i ment."
10657,i9883m,"You are optimistic. The normal person follows politics very little, and only receives some drips of information from the dominant media... All of whom are extreme leftists, barring Fox."
10658,i9883m,They will. Our side is too busy working right now and trying not to get doxxed by psychopaths.
10659,i9883m,Good way to put it or in other words we are all fucked
10660,i9883m,Oh ok
10661,i9883m,"I agree 100%.  See this crap from both sides.  As a fairly conservative person it bothers the crap out of me when I see all Republicans labeled as the same person.  Obviously we all, liberal or conservative, don‚Äôt fit the same mold. Unfortunately it‚Äôs the extremists on each side that make the rest of us look bad."
10662,i9883m,This is the reason why I hate social media. Stuff like this makes me confused if this is trolling or he is for real
10663,i9883m,Statistically speaking...they have a very high percentage of being killed by another black man. They are actually 4x more likely to be shot by a friend than a cop or white person.
10664,i9883m,I Know it sucks for us
10665,i9883m,Because that‚Äôs how it works you get booked investigated and then charged.
10666,i9883m,I think he meant TV.
10667,i9883m,What leftist is defending this?
10668,i9883m,All I had to type into google was 5 and then ‚Äú5 year old boy shot‚Äù popped up as the first search.
10669,i9883m,Who‚Äôs to say these are moderate liberals?
10670,i9883m,"Here's an actual blogger, not just a rando facebook comment

While I disagree with those comments, I not know if they‚Äôre real so it does me no good to be mad at those people."
10672,i9883m,"And there are people that would be taking joy if the kid was Asian, Black, Middle Eastern, Mexican. But the vast, vast majority of people don't think its cool to kill a child, and anyone that does should honestly get help."

10675,i9883m,I‚Äôve shot past conservative and landed somewhere near Attila the Hun.
10676,i9883m,You‚Äôre not alone.
10677,i9883m,Same.
10678,i9883m,"Same here, I used to consider what libbies had to say, now they‚Äôre just way too clown and every time they say shit like this i go further and further to the right"
10679,i9883m,Same here
10680,i9883m,"Me too, buddy. Once a lib, now totally done with the leftist nonsense"
10681,i9883m,There‚Äôs extremes on both sides.
10682,i9883m,"Did you see the perfect sentence structure, spelling and punctuation?
THAT is what we have come to?"
10683,i9883m,Awesome. :)
10684,i9883m,Leave prison? He should be put to death!
10685,i9883m,"That's the problem.  Lack of a boogyman.

So maybe they're doing heinous things like this to drum up an opposition?  I sincerely think some of these nutters want open conflict.  It's disheartening."
10686,i9883m,[deleted]
10687,i9883m,This is the problem with the press giving air time to fringe elements. Some basement white supremacist who knew of his step-brother Kleetus who shared his views is suddenly being told there are TONS of white supremacists (despite there being no hard evidence there are). So these people feel bolder in their beliefs.
10688,i9883m,Where do you get the idea that the majority think like this??
10689,i9883m,[deleted]
10690,i9883m,Nah. I‚Äôve seen videos where they rant ‚Äúkill the white cops‚Äù
10691,i9883m,And what about them cheering when tony snow got cancer and died. All POS
10692,i9883m,Americans or bots ? I mean how would you know ?
10693,i9883m,"Hopefully 20 years from now we'll look back on the phrase ""person of color"" and recognize it for the racist phrase that it is. What I take away from ""POC"", is that's there's white people and then there's everyone else. It's a great example of how subtlety racist the left can be."
10694,i9883m,I do that? Wtf?
10695,i9883m,"A few years ago ChaCha (before smart phones were big, you could text them a question and one of their people would essentially Google it for you) shared an article about a Republican politician who commited suicide and added a caption that more Republicans should commit suicide. Facebook didn't see any issue with it when I reported it."
10696,i9883m,Cognitive dissonance man
10697,i9883m,"Can one of the 28 people who upvoted this please point me to some sort of proof that either of these two groups (one of which isn't really a group, it's just a movement) is part of the democratic party? Or are people just upvoting because they like to imagine that it's true?"
10698,i9883m,"It's all out of control. And if George Floyd was white, man none of this shit would've happened."
10699,i9883m,"Some dude commented on this post here though saying he saw the post, maybe try to find him? Sorry though!"
10700,i9883m,It doesn‚Äôt matter. This person is a piece of shit either way.
10701,i9883m,I have a Facebook account but I never go on there. These pictures were sent to me.
10702,i9883m,"It's crazy. I'm more in the middle because half my family is liberal and half is conservative.

  
The conservative side could get double digit gains if as a whole it just felt more compassionate. Like you can hate McCain for his policies while he was in office, but goddamn I was so proud every time he had the balls to call out his supporters for racist or ignorant thinking."
10703,i9883m,"A whole slew of them.  Leftists excuse and defend virtually any sort of criminal act committed by any sort of brown person.  

Burn down a gas station?  Leftists say we shouldn't arrest them and that it's on everybody else to ""understand how they feel.""  

Beat a white person in the street just because they are white and outside of their house during a BLM riot (oops... I mean ""protest"")?  Well, that white person should have recognized their privilege and remained inside.

Let's not limit the discussion to black people.  It's all brown people the left do this sort of thing with.  Remember Kate Steinle?  Hispanic killer.  Went free.  No justice for her murder.  Because leftists Californians can't fathom the idea of putting a brown person in prison.  Never mind that the guy was here illegally... repeatedly... and was not allowed to be in possession of a weapon in the first place. 

Black Panther goes to a polling place with a weapon and talks about how it's time to kill white babies?  Oh, prosecute him... until he's found guilty.  Then remove all the consequences.  I mean, can't actually have a black person suffer a consequence for that sort of thing, can we, Barack?

The left has made this their calling card.  And it is absolutely disgusting."
10704,i9883m,they are present day are they not?
10705,i9883m,The person who did and anyone who supports it are despicable.
10706,i9883m,"Fair enough, although if the roles were reversed and those that were cheering were white.  It would turn into a big giant s\*\*\*show, unlike what we see here."

10712,i9883m,"Could be worse, could be Genghis."
10713,i9883m,"Yes, but Republican extremists aren't rioting, murdering, and looting Democratic cities around the country. 

I'm watching Portland and Seattle say ""No cops!"" While their citizens sue the city for not protecting them. I see the cities refuse federal assistance. I see the cities releasing violent offenders. I live in San Francisco and I see how being liberal on crime has turned this once beautiful city into a homeless-drug-addled poop filled wasteland."
10714,i9883m,They are their own worst enemy. Unfortunately they're either too corrupt to do anything about it or too stupid to realize it.
10715,i9883m,No
10716,i9883m,Let‚Äôs make some videos of our own where we chant ‚Äúliberalism is psychopathy‚Äù
10717,i9883m,"People under their REAL Facebook accounts.

But I also saw people that I KNEW doing the same thing."
10718,i9883m,"I assumed you were part of the democrats and left. Whether or not you are, my point still stands that they do that all the time. Not saying it‚Äôs right either way."
10719,i9883m,"I agree, all races matter, I‚Äôve seen Asian people just get murdered in the U.S and Canada but no one cares but all of the sudden when a black person dies, the entire country goes into riot."
10720,i9883m,"That‚Äôs the whole point of what we are seeing.  

If you are white, when you are pulled over what is your biggest fear?  A ticket, a fine, being late for work?

My friends are fearful that if pulled over they will be shot or attacked.

Not saying all cops are like that, but just think about that for a moment and tell me we don‚Äôt need to reassess how we treat our fellow man.

We still can‚Äôt even treat our fellow woman with the same honor and respect.  It‚Äôs 2020 and we are still dealing with things that our ancestors dealt with.  

Change starts with you."
10721,i9883m,You report it annnnnd they do nothing. But we post our talking points and we get banned. That's Zuckerbot!
10722,i9883m,"These comments are inherently nuts. They are not inherently liberal. They are inexcusably extreme ideas of support of black people, but the basic idea of supporting black people is not a liberal thing.

To put it another way, why is it impossible for these comments to be posted by a conservative person?"
10723,i9883m,Agreed.
10724,i9883m,Sometimes I find my self angry at trump after reading a leftist article and then I listen to Trump make his case and it turns out the leftist article was complete lies.
10725,i9883m,Or did the democrats leave you?
10726,i9883m,I‚Äôm with you there.
10727,i9883m,"Best*

Fify"
10728,i9883m,"Basically.

There are nuts on both sides, but I‚Äôve never seen someone slash tires and beat someone to death because he voted for someone. Until now."
10729,i9883m,You know people who advocate shooting other people. Strange crowd to run with.
10730,i9883m,"If I'm being honest, I'd say blacks are more racist than whites. And if I'm being honest, I think most of the BLM movement is white people speaking on behalf of blacks for whatever reason."
10731,i9883m,"also, i said modern, not moderate."
10732,i9883m,"im not saying they are liberal. i am saying they are leftist. if you honestly think that they come from the right side of isle, then ive got an island to sell you.


dont be obtuse."

10738,i9883m,"So now you are turning my experience around in order to somehow condemn me?

Yes...I was shocked and horrified to see people I know saying that they were okay with a guy opening fire on Republicans."
10739,i9883m,"If you don‚Äôt know many liberals and leftists, you need a wider social circle. Living in echo chambers doesn‚Äôt promote intellectual growth. If you do know a decent number of leftists and liberals, you know people who openly express these sentiments; they‚Äôre not exactly uncommon on the left."
10740,i9883m,"I agree, blacks say all stupid stuff like, all whites had slaves, some didn‚Äôt, hell I get mad when blacks blame the British for starting slavery but the British were actually one of the first to ban it, and they used there military force to make other European countries ban it as well, blacks just think they are so mistreated, well guess what? All races are equal and all are mistreated so stop acting so special."
10741,i9883m,Bunch on white guilt that has accumulated from too much media and listen to race clown like Oprah and   company.
10742,i9883m,"I have to say that since I‚Äôve lived in multiple parts of the country, the two places where I‚Äôve lived where blacks had the most racism were New York and Los Angeles.

I am down here in the south and lived in the heartland of Pennsylvania, and I never saw racist people from the black or white side of life."
10743,i9883m,"I‚Äôm black, and you are absolutely correct. Black people don‚Äôt even have incentive to hide it."
10744,i9883m,"Hit the nail on the head, sir."
10745,i9883m,"That was one of the more entertaining lies, the Rushmore thing.  But this little boy getting killed and the media completely ignoring it, surely the founding fathers didn‚Äôt have that in mind when they were constructing the Constitution."
10746,i9883m,Tell me more.
10747,i9883m,"They didn't, they said his people actually reached out to the state to find out the process to add 'someone' about the time he made one of his 'off-handed quips' about how he belonged up there."

10775,i04v99,"Do you see this?? These people have no critical thinking they have no purpose. CNN is THE most left leaning news station there is. CNN spews the garbage that these people support and fight for yet here they are having fun destroying the CNN building. They are not fighting for anything, they are immature, childish adults who simply want an excuse to act out. This is fun for them. I can see them now all giddy and excited come time to gather with their friends to go to a riot.

Did you see the dude just the window and then throw his hands up?? This is a GAME to these people. Trump needs to send in the military and shut this shit DOWN. I am so sorry to any left leaning person that‚Äôs actually sane and respectful and responsible but FUCK these fools and FUCK their garbage and baseless rhetoric.

This needs to end so we can get back to the way things should be. The true American way of life. Not these lies and overly sensitive and overly offended and forcing beliefs and views onto everyone type of bullshit.

This is beyond disgusting. I cannot wait to vote for president Trump and I hope we bring out the big guns when he wins later this year.

Vote people. Vote and make noise. No more should we be the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù but we should now be the ‚Äúloud and proud majority‚Äù. Make it happen with me people.

Stay safe everyone, including those on the left. The same and respectful ones that remain. They may be few and far between but I know there are some that still exist lol. Right? There has to be."

I guarantee, if the roles were reversed you would do worse. Why is that hard to understand?"
10848,i04v99,"This is beautiful. Cops should let them have fun.

IMO CNN and other left media that constantly push this narrative are to blame. For the past generation headlines like  ""black man shot by white cop"" even in stories in which it was justified or debatable.

They have damaged this country beyond belief. Instead of looking as the real issues with police (and there are some) they blame it on racism. So nothing constructive ever happens to help people stuck in the generational cycle of poverty, we never discuss problems officers have with mental health or training, and everyone just keeps getting more and more pissed off.

And why? To reinforce the democratic voter base? Ratings? Its time CNN, MSNBC, NYT, etc be held accountable for the social damage they have caused.

A part of me understands why the black community is so mad and why they distrust authority. Leftists tell them we all hate them and the police are hunting them down because of their skin color.
         Wouldn't you be mad too?"
10849,i04v99,"And, what? The police are hero's?

Turns out if you treat people like subhuman scum for long enough they decide to fight back."
10850,i04v99,dont you see it? its white supremacy rioting and destroying cnn's building /s

People with lust for Satisfaction, who are incapable of being Satisfied."
10865,i04v99,I know a lot of lefties blame CNN for shutting Sanders out of primary coverage.
10866,i04v99,"I think there is logic to their motive, though it is stupid. It is your standard witch hunt logic but applied to white supremacy rather than witchcraft. The logic is that, to them, CNN is defending white supremacy. Despite CNN defending BLM, it is owned by white elites and is thus part of the oppression that black people face. They know that no one will peaceably give up their wealth (at least not all of it), so destroying the wealth, taking the wealth, or coercing the wealthy to give up their wealth is what is necessary to achieve their goals.

This is obviously foolish and stupid, but if you assume their insane beliefs, attacking CNN makes sense. Their beliefs are unfalsifiable so they justify every destructive act they do. What I mean is that for reason to work, a theory needs to be falsifiable. If you claim ""all swans are white"", it is impossible to find all swans to show they are white. So you make a bit of an assumption, based on all the swans we have seen, they are all white. But if we found a black swan, it would falsify the statement. A good theory has to be falsifiable given a certain finding. So we go with the idea that swans are white until we find that which  makes it false. If there is nothing that can prove your statement false, then there is nothing that really makes it true. ""The earth is round"" could be proven false if we found evidence that it is flat, we haven't, there is no evidence of that, but if there were, it would falsify that claim. That means the claim is testable.

Anyway, there is no way to falsify BLM's claims because they constantly shift. There is no way to falsify their claim that ""white people have all the power"" because they just take it to another step. If CNN helps BLM, well they can still attack CNN because it was founded by a white man and has made money from advertisers, many of which were founded by white men. And if the white man that owns CNN (Ted Turner) was supportive of BLM and all the companies that advertise on CNN supported BLM, well they can still all be torn down because some of the money they were founded on was attained through white privilege. And if somehow Ted Turner, all the advertisers on CNN, all the reporters and other workers of CNN somehow all attained their positions in life without white privilege, then their forefathers did. If any of them are black, well they aren't black enough. 

It is unfalsifiable because it keeps going back, there is always something that makes you guilty. It's your standard witch hunt."
10867,i04v99,"I think CNN and Fox News are both fear-mongering hate-generating trash that do nothing but divide us, and a lot of people on both sides feel the same."
10868,i04v99,"Lots of people are tired of their bullshit, enough said."
10869,i04v99,I believe there is a police station within the CNN centre. Still stupid and still not peaceful.
10870,i04v99,Boredom. Unemployment. Take your pick.
10871,i04v99,CNN supported HQL as a possible successful treatment for COVID. Since Trump supported HQL in the first place they think CNN sided with Trump rather than the health of the American people so they burn it down. They lost the game so they‚Äôre flipping the board over.
10872,i04v99,If I remember correctly it was because there was a police headquarters inside of the building.

10932,i04v99,">There is no way to falsify their claim that ""white people have all the power"" because they just take it to another step.

The statement ""white people on average control a disproportionate amount of wealth and power in America"" is not ""unfalsifiable"" so much as it's ""objectively true,"" which I think is an important distinction to make. Saying ""all swans are white"" is falsifiable, but is also objectively true until evidence to the contrary is presented. A lack of contrary evidence does not, on its own, make a claim unfalsifiable.

Going back in time and mounting evidence that ""CNN contributes to White people's disproportionate power because of this, that, and the other"" does not make the initial claim unfalsifiable any more than evidence of ""what happened to cause all swans to be white today"" make its related claim unfalsifiable.

All of your points of ""anti-logic"", as it were, are things that people see as being problematic and therefore worth addressing in their own right. CNN presenting positive coverage of BLM does not invalidate the claim that aspects of its business are not inline with the ""ideals of the movement."""

If there was just ONE case like that each year, they would still do this. Yet I've never heard a real widespread discussion on how to rebuild our inner cities and stop generational poverty (or cut it down, more realistically)

I've spent time in inner cities and have known many people living on them. Most of us dont realise how it is A COMPLETLY DIFFERENT culture because of drug addict teen parents treating their kids like shit and only having kids to get more money in welfare
This is the truth. It's not just blacks. Tons of white families live in those areas and do the same.

10962,i04v99,">The statement ""white people on average control a disproportionate amount of wealth and power in America"" is not ""unfalsifiable"" so much as it's ""objectively true,""

See, you are doing what they are doing. They use white privilege to justify all of their claims, including this one. You are also isolating this statement from the rest of their claim. ""White people control a disproportionate amount of the wealth and power in America."" Yes, that is objectively true. But you conveniently forget to tack on the rest of their claim ""and it is only because of white privilege and slavery."" The statistics do not line up with that claim. The reason white people do well in this country is the same reason Jews and Asians do well in this country (though it is getting harder for white people because of a growing trend in this statistic) because families are strong and work ethics are strong as well. Black teens used to be more likely to be employed than white teens. What changed? Racist laws like minimum wage created by democrats who wanted blacks out of ""their"" industries, and welfare laws that kept black people down and the black family fractured. Now, white families are feeling that problem more and more as the family deteriorates for them as well. This leads to more government dependence and worse work ethic.

Further, white people are the wealthiest in the world, too. But why? You seem to advocate white privilege, as do those I am criticizing, but is that the issue? Asia used to be the richest and most advanced. Now Asia is the richest region of the world. Not white Europe. Why? Why not Africa? Does it have anything to do with white privilege? No. This is how history has worked, but the woke left only sees history from a lens that spans only 250 years, and only from the lens of slave trade... but what's worse is they only look at it from the lens of the slave trade to Europe and the US. They fail to recognize that slavery has always existed and the worst culprits of slavery were in the Middle East (who were responsible for the European and US slave trade), Africa, and Asia.

You can't falsify white privilege because they refuse to look at real history and because they refuse to look at evidence to the contrary because to them, it can't possibly exist.

White Europeans are wealthy because they happened to develop at a time and use their resources at a time that led to the most success in the world. Any other kind of people could have done it had they been in the same position. Fortunately, they also gave us the ideas of rights that keep us free of tyranny and give us the tools to ensure that freedom extends to all our citizens.

So as intelligent and reasoned as you are, your comment here is dishonest because you cherry picked a point and argued that rather considering the totality of the argument."

I will reluctantly support him this election this year as well because Biden (while not as bad as clinton) is awful as well. 

Personally, if I‚Äôm going to vote red, I want the candidate to actually be red"
10976,i04v99,"agreed. I don‚Äôt know why the DNC keeps shoving these candidates down our throats. Corporate interests, probably. The people deserve to have better candidates than Biden and Trump."
10977,i04v99,">Yes, that is objectively true. But you conveniently forget to tack on the rest of their claim ""and it is only because of white privilege and slavery.""

Your point is well-taken, I could/should have been more thorough. Thank you for presenting some additional points that I can address specifically.

Even if we assume that those are the only two arguments that people have, white privilege is a *really* broad catch-all (not claiming that this is your fault, just the nature of the phrase) for any benefits that white people experience compared to non-white people as a result of the present state of policy, society, etc. It's not an attack or an ""inherent property of white people"" so much as a resultant attribute.

If having a strong nuclear family results in greater chances of success for children in those families, and white families tend to be stronger than non-white families, then that results in white privilege. If you believe that minimum wage results in income disparity for non-whites, then that results in white privilege as white people have the ""privilege"" of being able to escape minimum wage jobs while non-whites do not. If school districts in high/middle-income neighborhoods tend to perform better than schools in low-income neighborhoods, and white people are more likely to reside in high/middle-income school districts, that results in white privilege. The list goes on, of course.

>Further, white people are the  wealthiest in the world, too. But why? You seem to advocate white  privilege, as do those I am criticizing, but is that the issue? Asia  used to be the richest and most advanced. Now Asia is the richest region  of the world. Not white Europe. Why? Why not Africa? Does it have  anything to do with white privilege? No. This is how history has worked,  but the woke left only sees history from a lens that spans only 250  years, and only from the lens of slave trade... but what's worse is they  only look at it from the lens of the slave trade to Europe and the US.  They fail to recognize that slavery has always existed and the worst  culprits of slavery were in the Middle East (who were responsible for  the European and US slave trade), Africa, and Asia.  
>  
>You  can't falsify white privilege because they refuse to look at real  history and because they refuse to look at evidence to the contrary  because to them, it can't possibly exist.

I think that my previous paragraph kind of covers this. White privilege is a resultant attribute, meaning that it might take on different attributes in Europe than in the United States. Further, white privilege on the scale of the entire planet would look different yet again.

As far as ""why the United States and not Africa,"" saying something like ""American Privilege"" makes much more sense, or possibly even ""Asian privilege"" to take your point regarding wealth in Asia compared to elsewhere. Surely Americans and Europeans are, on average, more privileged than Africans? The difference here is that you can (edit:) immigrate to America from Africa, but you cannot become a white American or African from a black American or African.

I understand the argument that ""racism has happened/does happen in many places,"" but I just don't really see it as relevant. Yes, slavery happened elsewhere, and we can discuss the effects that slavery had on those places all we'd like, but that's irrelevant when we talk about American culture and society. Slavery in the Middle-East, Europe, Africa or wherever -- aside from contributing to the existence of slavery in the United States -- has literally no bearing on the effect of American slavery on American society.

>White Europeans are wealthy because they happened to develop at a time  and use their resources at a time that led to the most success in the  world. Any other kind of people could have done it had they been in the  same position. Fortunately, they also gave us the ideas of rights that  keep us free of tyranny and give us the tools to ensure that freedom  extends to all our citizens.

Ah okay, I think I understand what you're saying, here. These white Europeans had the privilege of using their resources at a time that led to the most success in the world, while others did not benefit from those same privileges of circumstance?"

10988,i04v99,"> If having a strong nuclear family results in greater chances of success for children in those families, and white families tend to be stronger than non-white families, then that results in white privilege.

You misunderstand it seems. Privilege doesn't exist. There is luck and there is choice. What you describe here isn't privilege, it is a matter of one group making better decisions than another. There are many reasons for that, but the choice to make those decisions remains. It is not white privilege to have a stronger nuclear family, especially considering black families were strong not all that long ago.

Privilege is a myth and it is always heavily stacked against whites and is absurdly only looked at through the lens of race. A black American has a far better life than the vast majority of black Africans. Is that American privilege? Black Americans have access to all kinds of wealth, health care, education, and many other things that Africans have none of. Why is that privilege not addressed? The answer is because the idea of white privilege was invented and always been used to make white people the enemy.

It is a lie. You should stop defending it."

Police aren‚Äôt educated enough in dealing with mentally ill. Another man with bipolar was shot and killed in ABQ again this week. Very unfortunate. I honestly think that we need to be focusing more  on all the many many mentally ill people who have been killed by poorly trained cops."
11050,ik2enz,please elaborate I want to know what is manipulated and what is not
11051,ik2enz,"Everything I wrote is rooted in fact, and you‚Äôre free to research it. All you have are logical fallacies and a lack of critical thinking skills. Do me a favor and slap the litter shit out of your stupid ass mother for brining you into this world. Thanks partner"
11052,ik2enz,Ladies and gents DT ü§°supporters. Have you made it past high school?
11053,ik2enz,"People have proven a million times over that even if you are a creepy man, racist, or even a pedophile - it doesn't matter!! As long as you have money people will listen to you. I think we've moved away from actually caring what comes out of someone's mouth or who they associate with and care more about political action."
11054,ik2enz,"You talking about me, or bunker boy? Lol"
11055,ik2enz,All I get is June incident
11056,ik2enz,i'll take that
11057,ik2enz,"I‚Äôll admit, ‚Äúlargest in the Midwest‚Äù is just hearsay, but it‚Äôs there for sure.  
https://drgnews.com/2020/08/18/eight-men-arrested-in-sex-trafficking-operation-during-the-2020-sturgis-motorcycle-rally/

Also, a friend of mine was raped there a few years ago so I have strong feelings about the rally."
11058,ik2enz,To who do you think should the funds be reallocated? And what tasks would they do?
11059,ik2enz,you cant send in an unarmed social worker its too risky
11060,ik2enz,"Or that social worker is going to end up dead, wounded or a hostage."
11061,ik2enz,That‚Äôs just plain retarded.
11062,ik2enz,I sincerely doubt there will be a 100% success rate switching social workers for armed police.  If you play this hand you‚Äôre gonna see a lot of dead social workers.
11063,ik2enz,That was my point if you didn‚Äôt catch on.
11064,ik2enz,Because the cop has the right to go home safe. Regardless of WHY he was called there. Not saying it‚Äôs good. But horrible things happen.
11065,ik2enz,"True. I think that simply allowing for better training, giving cops more good options, and giving them fewer bad options for how to end a situation is what we need to do."
11066,ik2enz,Nah I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôd rather waste my time doing other things.

11071,ik2enz,"I never been and not a huge fan of bikers. The size of events and the size of the population of the state I know it exists, just not sure it is as large of numbers as say Burning Man and other events."
11072,ik2enz,"I‚Äôm talking about a suicidal man, not a bank robber."
11073,ik2enz,Well they did call a social worker. They just took too long to get there. With collaborative work I think less people will get killed or injured by police who are not trained to deescalate and become scared for their life they can‚Äôt rationalize well.
11074,ik2enz,A cop in my house is threatening.  A nice social worker lady telling me I have a reason to live is not.  If there‚Äôs no reason to expect violence I don‚Äôt see why this isn‚Äôt better
11075,ik2enz,"I totally agree. They have a lot of pressure on them, implementing other programs to help alleviate the load they have is the best thing to do. I think a lot of cops would agree that working with social workers and healthcare workers would benefit everyone."
11076,ik2enz,It doesn‚Äôt matter if he‚Äôs racist or not.
11077,ik2enz,The bike rally is about 10 times larger than burning man and it‚Äôs in a very methy area.  Not too far from big neo nazi groups either. Burning man probably has more shroom trafficking than anything.
11078,ik2enz,I vote we just let him kill himself. Multiple problems solved and money saved.
11079,ik2enz,"A cop in your house is helpful, unless you are a piece of shit criminal. Then he‚Äôs a dick. Cops are not threatening unless you did something wrong."
11080,ik2enz,"You‚Äôre thinking like a sane person.  We are talking about people on the edge of sanity if not past that point.  It might be better in some cases, in others the social worker is not going to fare well."
11081,ik2enz,"I think that police officers should stick to law enforcement - if they think that the law was violated in a certain situation, they get to handle it. But unfortunately, it seems like cops are being told to handle a lot more than enforcing the law."

11083,ik2enz,Oh now it doesn't matter that he's a racist. Wow talk about floundering about. What is with you people?
11084,ik2enz,"Fair enough. As I said, I have no dog in the fight for them.


Thanks for the conversation."
11085,ik2enz,"I kinda get your point. I feel like resources need to be out there to provide help; however, I think at the core of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and having rights to your body, you should be able to what you want with it.

Even if I don‚Äôt agree with what you are doing. we can‚Äôt claim this a free society if you can‚Äôt do something that doesn‚Äôt affect anyone else."
11086,ik2enz,You're a horrible degenerate piece of ignorant filth
11087,ik2enz,That‚Äôs just so plainly untrue if your skin ain‚Äôt white though.  Breonna Taylor didn‚Äôt do shit and a cop shot her in her own house.
11088,ik2enz,"What? I'm saying that even though he's racist, he has done good things for the country. I believe that most of the people who support him do not care about him being racist. So why make an argument about if he is or is not?"
11089,ik2enz,Say we shouldn‚Äôt let people kill themselves is now too extreme for this sub. Something something pro-life...
11090,ik2enz,Say we shouldn‚Äôt let people kill themselves is now too extreme for this sub. Something something pro-life...
11091,ik2enz,"Sorry I take the idea of ‚Äúright to control your body‚Äù very seriously. 

If you can have a do not resuscitate order, why can‚Äôt you kill yourself? Why should we as a society say ‚Äúno you can‚Äôt die until a doctor you don‚Äôt want has a say in it‚Äù? Until the last 500 years or so cultures all over the world has ritualistic suicides that weren‚Äôt frowned upon. 

I have talked 12 people out of suicide this year and 1 of them on 3 separate occasions. Let me be clear, I don‚Äôt think suicide is a good idea and it‚Äôs solved nothing. I just don‚Äôt think that the government should be able to stop you. Suicide and assisted suicide should be legal."
11092,ik2enz,"That isn‚Äôt true that she was innocent. 

The facts: 

1. Bailed out her drug dealing BF at least twice. 
2. Covered for him and his gang with regards to a murder in her own rental car. 
3. Allowed her drug dealing boyfriend to use her address as a mailing address. 
4. Allowed her BF to open a bank account using her address. 
5. Showed up at her BF‚Äôs drug house a month before the raid. 
6. Was running a drug dealer‚Äôs finances and holding money for him. 

Unknown to police she left him and had another man move in with her, but still was handling the money for her ex. 

They knocked 3 times and then announced themselves and they broke the door in. Her Started shooting and she stood in the hall like a moron and got hit. 

It is sad, yea it is even though she was foolish to be involved in criminal activity. Is it a crime that she got shot? No. Her death is on her and a little bit on her BF.

11093,i4dtp0,"I haven't seen him for a while on youtube, did he take a break or was he just making his content available to his mugclub?

Keep up the good work Steven, we love you buddy!"

11100,i4dtp0,"Been saying that for months, not like that though. Kudos to Crowder."
11101,i4dtp0,God‚Äôs work
11102,i4dtp0,Doesn't he have pretty tight armed security around him when he does these?
11103,i4dtp0,"Nothing to be afraid of. Neckbeard leftists are only violent in packs, plus crowder is 6 foot 5 accompanied by another 6 foot 5 bodyguard."
11104,i4dtp0,The Bureau of Land Management is a terrorist organization
11105,i4dtp0,"I mean, they pretty much self admittedly want the abolishment of the Republican party and think the world would be better without any conservatives. It reminds me of a little group of "" freedom fighters"" that just thought world would be better with only Islam. History has showed us repeatedly that people rarely fight for your freemdoms'. They mostly just fight to be free of people they don't agree with. If you use violence or the threat of it, for political/ idialogical gain, by definition you are a terrorist."
11106,i4dtp0,That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs come to? Speaking facts is considered brave now?
11107,i4dtp0,"It takes balls of steel to do something like that and for that, he has forever earned my respect."
11108,i4dtp0,He's right though..
11109,i4dtp0,Funny how they riot over dead criminals but not for the thousands of blacks murdered by other blacks.
11110,i4dtp0,"black lives matter, but with lower case letters."
11111,i4dtp0,Oof. The previous episodes were controversial but you could mop the floors with his balls for this one.
11112,i4dtp0,"The thing is if a black person beats him up or worse, shoots him, they will just prove his point."
11113,i4dtp0,Well he‚Äôs right
11114,i4dtp0,Judging by their actions that‚Äôs accurate
11115,i4dtp0,I‚Äôm not too big a fan of him but that takes balls lmao.
11116,i4dtp0,Yes it is .. and yes he does
11117,i4dtp0,Link to the video?
11118,i4dtp0,"In my opinion, he is pioneering a revolution of free speech. Conservatives have been silenced for too long. It has gotten to the point that we fear voicing our opinions as we are accused of racism and sexism. The list goes on. Steven Crowder is leading the ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù of the silent majority."
11119,i4dtp0,"The group BLM the main group. One of the major issues with this ‚Äúmovement‚Äù is there‚Äôs so many different groups, rationales, mindsets, ideas, ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù coming from many groups trying to use the sane phrases.

Seems like some of the only unifying aspects are 1) that Black America feels/ has been slighted 2) animosity for anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with their solutions to that"
11120,i4dtp0,Oh shit that's awesome. Does anyone have the video of him doing this?
11121,i4dtp0,Can‚Äôt wait to watch this lol
11122,i4dtp0,"Okay. An organization saying that cops shouldn‚Äôt kill or hurt someone excessively for breaking a law is not wrong. 

The fact that you think people getting hurt and killed before trial is ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù shows how cops are allowed to get away with it. 

There will always be people who take advantage of a situation. It‚Äôs like all the racists hiding behind the republican push for stricter immigration laws just cus they hate brown people."
11123,i4dtp0,I guess I dont get it. Why consider it a domestic terrorist organization?
11124,i4dtp0,"My cousin just started taking classes at that college, and she‚Äôs a staunch liberal. I wonder if I‚Äôll see her in the vid."
11125,i4dtp0,Is crowder on vacation? I haven't seen a show on youtube for about a month?
11126,i4dtp0,I can't figure out for the life of me why I used to confuse this guy with Owen Shroyer.
11127,i4dtp0,Why does he look like a pirate now :( I used to love his old look
11128,i4dtp0,Blm is funded by PLA?
11129,i4dtp0,big ol' klackers on this guy.
11130,i4dtp0,This one‚Äôs gonna be juicy
11131,i4dtp0,I didn‚Äôt bring up critical theory so idk
11132,i4dtp0,"They need to get back to their original message and just say ""Police shouldn't kill blacks more than whites"". People will get behind that, but now BLM has such a weird messaging problem."
11133,i4dtp0,"I think this is too far. To me, BLM is like Kony2012. A social media campaign primarily composed of teenagers and 20-somethings without a single clue what they are doing and what the results of their actions entail, they‚Äôre just being lead by a select insane few with detrimental ambitions utilizing the emotional wave."
11134,i4dtp0,"If black lives matter was an actual terrorist group, wouldn't they kill him for saying this?"
11135,i4dtp0,There's something really disturbing about how obsessed you guys are with trolling
11136,i4dtp0,he‚Äôs right you know
11137,i4dtp0,He's one of the best we have on our side üá∫üá∏

11139,i4dtp0,"I‚Äôm gonna pray for that man‚Äôs safety. Love his content, hope he brought some extra security for this one."
11140,i4dtp0,"Okay but can we not repost from that sub. If you want to show you‚Äôre beliefs than that sub is not it. Also, I agree that the organization is bad, but the people who want equality are good"
11141,i4dtp0,Amen to that!

11159,i4dtp0,"Steven crowder is a racist, change my mind!"
11160,i4dtp0,"It's not an organization. It's a movement. It's about ending qualified immunity for police in direct response to a proven history of police violence against people of colour.

11171,i4dtp0,Yea he took a break because he and his wife had a miscarriage and he talked about it like 2 days ago
11172,i4dtp0,He takes a break every July and december

11178,i4dtp0,Yes
11179,i4dtp0,I think he does
11180,i4dtp0,"So like 15 of them, in the dark, would try to throw something at him. But when he turns around, boy howdy, they'll be beating a fuckin' retreat."
11181,i4dtp0,Nevertheless I hope he has a CC permit (knowing him he probably does)
11182,i4dtp0,"Crowder is in fairly good physical shape, and I think he trains in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. If a lone leftist attacks him, they're probably going to have a really bad day. Crowder is such a nice dude, though, so he'd probably just get them in a hold of some sort and keep them there until they calm down, instead of hurting them badly."
11183,i4dtp0,"Or, here's a thought, as a leftist it is quite possible to engage in peaceful civil debate without needing to be violent."
11184,i4dtp0,Plus he'll call the cops when he loses a debate
11185,i4dtp0,"They also fight to subjugate, which is a big component of ""blm"". You will let us riot, loot, kill, burn, etc with no consequences and you will like it!"
11186,i4dtp0,"I think BLM is as good for blacks as PETA is for animals, even though they seem to have nice names they don‚Äôt have many or probably any nice actions."

11188,i4dtp0,I know he‚Äôs right
11189,i4dtp0,IKR
11190,i4dtp0,The protests are about disproportionate police violence I thought?
11191,i4dtp0,Watch out!! That is forbidden to mention and you‚Äôll be branded!!!
11192,i4dtp0,This has been an issue long before George Floyd. Not to mention this issue is specifically about those in positions of authority abusing that authority over a historically oppressed group. Accountability and oversight of the police benefits everyone.

11209,i4dtp0,"People who claim that the NRA is a terrorist organization are either trolls or have been fed so much disinformation they can't even think properly.  It's the absolutely dumbest thing one could possibly claim, yet morons repeat it.

The sad part is how many of those morons support an ACTUAL terrorist organization like BLM."

Jeez you trolls are getting pathetic"
11225,i4dtp0,How are we racist

11227,i4dtp0,Wrong!  You made that up!!!!!
11228,i4dtp0,Relax
11229,i4dtp0,Imagine thinking the BLM meant all black people üòÇ by that logic you can‚Äôt support BLM if you‚Äôre white
11230,i4dtp0,"Forget the color of their skin. We have a group that has shown itself to be violent and make threats of bodily harm.  Regardless of who belongs to such an organization, they're a threat to society.  Or, if they can get away with it, then it permits the KKK to go back to it's old ways.  As of now, I see BLM as a group of violent black racists. Prove me wrong."
11231,i4dtp0,"Nobody said that dipshit

The only people who said that is probably the Democrats"

11233,i4dtp0,It‚Äôs not photoshopped and Steven Crowder post this on his Twitter

11235,i4dtp0,"Oh okay that makes sense, I was getting kind of concerned when I hadn't heard anything in a while, and then knowing about his wife's medical condition had me fearing the worst these last few days. But it's good to see that he's back, and his wife is doing better!

11254,i4dtp0,But when you adjust police killings for both population and crime rates the statistics show no race is more likely to be killed by cops than another.
11255,i4dtp0,Which statistically is a lie
11256,i4dtp0,Funny how there are millions of police interactions every year and only 5 unarmed black people were killed in 2019.

11260,i4dtp0,"All I know is that I went down to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the protests and people chanting BLM and  no justice no peace. I saw only one violent party over a few days time. 

And nobody i know there was a Marxist. 
Just people who think nobody should be killed in their sleep, strangled, or abused, especially before trial. 

I did see peaceful protestors blocked in and then told to go home with no escape route. And then gassed. 

And I saw police walking down suburb streets and shooting at people on their porches.

It‚Äôs always the nasties that will be on the front of the news...."
11261,i4dtp0,I've heard bits a piece about Portland but what exactly are you referring to?
11262,i4dtp0,Obviously we have different information we've come across. I have not come across information that leads me to believe that BLM is a terrorist organization. So what information have you seen that led you to that conclusion?
11263,i4dtp0,the right kind of balls
11264,i4dtp0,Lol that's not how this works.
11265,i4dtp0,"The trajectory of the US is clearly liberal. The train of ‚Äúprogress‚Äù cannot be stopped. The country as a whole will either continue on this trajectory or fracture. The more control conservatives have over the country the more uprising we will see as a result of the majority population rejecting subjugation by a minority ideology. Conservatives ‚Äúwinning‚Äù is a double edged sword that‚Äôll swing back and destroy either conservatism or fracture the country. But Either outcome aligns with the long arch of America. A fractured America would ultimately rise as a forward leaning liberal progressive one... unless left leaning folks are completely massacred (~75% if you count non voters) But that will never happen realistically. 

I‚Äôm just looking at this from the 35,000 foot view. Literally everything conservatives hate about American society continually get worse in their eyes over time via change/progress... which is why they want to return to a golden age. 

I‚Äôm not even sure I understand it... it just is what it is."

11298,i4dtp0,"That's not the argument dipshit, the argument is about police accountability and power. They need more accountability, less power, and more training.

Civil forfeiture is bullshit, cops getting away with murder and rape is bullshit, the lack of training while militarizing them is bullshit.

It's a problem for everyone, not just black people, although they are receiving the worst of it. Everyone should be concerned over what the largest gang in America is getting away with right now."
11299,i4dtp0,"I can only speak from my own experiences when I say that the violent acts done by BLMers has been severely downplayed by the media. During the height of the George Floyd controversy, NYC was essentially broken and burned to the ground. I had family working as Emergency response (EMS) during these riots, and these fuckers threatened to murder them because they saw a uniform and badges. Our genius Mayor even ended the NYPD Anti-Crime Units. Since then, murders and other violent crimes have sky-rocketed. There is even a really sad case of woman being murdered for telling her neighbors not to shoot off fireworks at 2AM. [Here is the full article if you're interested. ](https://people.com/crime/nyc-woman-killed-after-fireworks-near-kids/)

I'm not saying that Police Brutality isn't an issue that should be resolved. I just think that the issue at hand is being high-jacked by Marxist organizations like BLM and ANTIFA and its being used to impose fascist group-think. We as a society, rightfully condemn Neo-Nazis for using violence to spread Marxist propaganda, but we tolerate and champion marxist leftists because they've been 'oppressed' by Western society? Give me a break."
11300,i4dtp0,"I understand what you are saying, but from first hand accounts we have evidence of blm and antifa 'cells' hiding within the peaceful protests and then using classic agitator techniques to force police intervention which is then met by outrage from the majority peaceful protesters who then feel unfairly treated and escalation ensues.

They have cells made up of people monitoring police and federal agent locations, herding protesters in certain directions, coordinating an attack from within the crowd to trigger a retaliatory response, communicate via encrypted messaging apps - these people are domestic terrorists using your own protests against you."

11315,i4dtp0,"Of course the right isn't opposed to education. There is a vast difference between being educated and being intelligent. There's huge sections of campus that are dedicated to classes based off critical theory, which is a Marxist ideology from the Frankfurt school of business. This was expressly founded by Marxists to expand in the west.

Teachers today teach good things, yes, but they either include their political slant, or have it coupled with non science.

We want a return to rational discussion and battle of ideas. Not a safe space or home to be more woke."
11316,i4dtp0,"I am very pro-education. I went to one of the best universities in the world in the Soviet city of Cambridge, MA. But if a person simply accepts everything his or her professor says, you aren‚Äôt getting education, you‚Äôre getting facts mixed with a lot of opinion. It‚Äôs no secret that higher education in US (and most places in the world) lean to the left. You will find conservative professors, the default is liberal. It is every student‚Äôs obligation to listen, learn, and form their own opinions after filtering fact from commentary."
11317,i4dtp0,"College campus isn‚Äôt the only form of education. 

Most of my non college friends GC‚Äôs, Trim carpenter‚Äôs, welders, plumbers, electricians friends make more than most students ever will with a doctorate.

No offense, but college is not the only option for education nor the most proficient at it. I‚Äôm pro education myself, but I do not narrowly state it only belongs at college. That is a poor generalist idea.

How many terrorist acts have been carried out in BLM‚Äôs name? Just look up any generic example of BLM protesters attacking bystanders during their protests, or attacking counter protesters at times.

Then take that name and let the world know that is who IBiteYou is and do so in a way that permanently associates your comment history with your real name and will be done outside of Reddit and it will not be something I ever need to contact you about.

That is the end goal here and I'm getting there either way so you might as well go for the harassment complaint, it won't make any difference in the final result because I'll get your name which is what I've been looking for. If you aim for criminal charges ALLLLL of our previous communication and A LOT of your posts on Reddit will also be taken into account for context and will be submitted as evidence in any court case that I will undoubtedly win because I don't think a lot of what you say, how you say it, the volume and frequency of the things that you say will go over very well as you try and play victim to my bothering you.

I'm sure the repeated phrases ""COME AT ME BRO"" will also guarantee your court case be taken with utmost seriousness.

We live in the same city too

So you can just file with our local PD as well

They'll still have to subpoena Reddit for my information and I'll also be forewarned from Reddit about my information being requested and handed to the authorities. So I'll await that notice from Reddit and in the meantime nobody has a right to silence my first amendment right to talk about you and I have 0 need to actually talk with you directly so like I said this is a win win for me. ty""*

This is from a reddit user who managed to dox someone else and text their phone pretending to be me... but when they realized that it was someone else, they stated their intent to find out my actual identity.

That person is legitimately crazy.  I have no idea the kind of shit they plan.  They said they'd never ""advocate harm"" to me, but they did want to let others know who I am and where I live.

11606,iqtxd2,"Now, now.... remember, she was a victim of a scam, and she will stick to that story and take it to the grave. And knowing Pelosi, that won‚Äôt be for long, long time. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
11607,iqtxd2,Let‚Äôs fave it. Some people are untouchable. Literally and figuratively.
11608,iqtxd2,Pelosi has her spot on prison waiting lol
11609,iqtxd2,‚ÄúWe would be derelict in our duty‚Äù as Americans not to push for prosecution. Sound familiar?
11610,iqtxd2,Noiceee
11611,iqtxd2,Helll yeah !
11612,iqtxd2,Prosecuted for this and so many corrupt deals.
11613,iqtxd2,"But shes a politician though, politicians are above the law they don‚Äôt have to follow it like us commoners"
11614,iqtxd2,Thousands? Those are rookie numbers....
11615,iqtxd2,"""Rules for thee but not for me.""

Interesting that sometimes when politicians write up bad things they specifically write in exemptions for themselves."
11616,iqtxd2,Sadly online petitions mean absolutely nothing.
11617,iqtxd2,"Guys, Trolls are trying to take over."
11618,iqtxd2,I hope that something comes from the petition because that lady deserves to have the book thrown at her.
11619,iqtxd2,Where can i sign?
11620,iqtxd2,"She has immunity folks. She can't be prosecuted. Just like Adam shitforbrains, all those statements he made claiming they had clear evidence of Russian collusion, he has 100% immunity because he's a Congressman, and made those statements in Congress. He cant be prosecuted, neither can she."
11621,iqtxd2,LOL Oh please like it is really going to happen. Obama broke well over fifty constitutional laws and nothing happened. Adam Schiff repeatedly lied to the American people numerous times on National TV about Trumps Russian collusion and nothing happened to him. Democrats are immune to our constitution and laws no one will hold them accountable for anything.
11622,iqtxd2,If this doesnt work can we prosecute her for looking like an old ham
11623,iqtxd2,"Doesn‚Äôt matter. She‚Äôs clearly ABOVE the law.

Edit: This was sarcasm. Nancy said this about Trump but her hypocritical self decided it doesn‚Äôt apply to her."
11624,iqtxd2,There's should be a law against being as dumb as her.
11625,iqtxd2,Lock her up!!!!
11626,iqtxd2,"While we are at it, end the BS covid lockdown."
11627,iqtxd2,She's a turd.
11628,iqtxd2,"She should first be prosecuted for the makeup job.  Geezus, Joseph, and Mary.  Wtf!"
11629,iqtxd2,[removed]
11630,iqtxd2,I mean the rule of law hasn‚Äôt been followed by anyone lately so I don‚Äôt expect this to go any further.
11631,iqtxd2,[removed]
11632,iqtxd2,r/whoosh
11633,iqtxd2,Oh wow! Whole thousands?!!!
11634,iqtxd2,Are y‚Äôall really this petty?
11635,iqtxd2,Should be prosecuted as much as anyone who's held or attended indoor political rallys without a mask
11636,iqtxd2,But they're not printed on--wait... Hold up.... I think I get it.
11637,iqtxd2,Ditto
11638,iqtxd2,"I tend to agree, but is this really the path we want to go down? I'd be much more contented if these ""mandates"" just went the fuck away and people lightened up. 

If they can prosecute Pelosi as much as I hate that bitch, then they can prosecute any one of us. ""That's not the point"" I'm already hearing so before you go there ... I get it, but legal precedent is legal precedent and like I said I don't think going down that path is appropriate or productive for a virus that 98.94% of people survive. A virus so deadly you have to take a test to know you even have it."
11639,iqtxd2,But remember politicians don‚Äôt have to follow the law look at Hillary she committed treason and won‚Äôt even get deposed.
11640,iqtxd2,I think every politician who thinks their mandates are laws should be impeached.
11641,iqtxd2,[removed]
11642,iqtxd2,"The mandates THEY promote to be signed into law, I‚Äôm not saying anyone should be prosecuted for getting a haircut, just being a hypocrite"
11643,iqtxd2,What about citizens?
11644,iqtxd2,Including the president? ü§î
11645,iqtxd2,[deleted]
11646,iqtxd2,She took it off to wash her hair and the pic is her walking back to her chair. Really?   The health department doesnt even actually levy the fine til the 3rd violation/warning most places. Can we give up being so petty?
11647,iqtxd2,Not if its taylor swifts petition for ‚Äúequality ‚Äú or whatever she was twatting on about at her award show
11648,iqtxd2,What an awesome comment. Says it all.
11649,iqtxd2,"The government is supposed to act on will of the people, but the democrats don't care. All they want is more and more power."
11650,iqtxd2,Its not just democrats. Petitions have very very rarely garnered even a twinkle of serious government consideration.
11651,iqtxd2,Thanks! signed.
11652,iqtxd2,"Damn, almost 30,000 people have signed. Pretty impressive."
11653,iqtxd2,She said she would resign if Trump won.
11654,iqtxd2,Except politicians
11655,iqtxd2,[removed]
11656,iqtxd2,The salon owner is going to do fine. She received over 300k from gofundme last I checked. Probably higher now.
11657,iqtxd2,Fine Pelosi.   But you must also fine the salon owner for every illegal appointment she scheduled.  Fair is fair.
11658,iqtxd2,You are behind on the news my friend.  The Intelligence Committee released their report last week.  A bipartisan one. And it determined there was collusion between Russia and the campaign staff.
11659,iqtxd2,Well they control most of the media and discredit what they don't. Won't be prosecuted if no one knows it happened.
11660,iqtxd2,Which fifty?
11661,iqtxd2,[removed]
11662,iqtxd2,Sadly this is very true. Well said.
11663,iqtxd2,"Well fine her then.   And then go after the salon owner and every one of these stylists advertising on Nextdoor and FB that they are doing appointments in their garage.  Unless you want to punish all the guilty, let this story die and walk away.  Equal justice for all, right?"
11664,iqtxd2,"You should see a professional for help with your TDS, let them know you troll internet sites specifically created to support Republicans and waste your time being rude because you can‚Äôt handle losing...

See you at the voting booth in November."
11665,iqtxd2,".........with no mask on, violating a law she helped set up, and while she‚Äôs been openly critical of the President and congressmen who did the same thing but while actually socially distanced.  

You missed a few details."
11666,iqtxd2,"Yeah, if it gets much worse were gonna start sounding like liberals. Good god, no !!!"
11667,iqtxd2,Why shouldn't we be? Democrats would do worse if it were the other way around. And why are you in a Republican sub if you're a Democrat? You aren't going to see anything you like on this sub.
11668,iqtxd2,"If your going to write the law you'd best be dn sure you follow them... So fuck yes. We're this ""petty""."
11669,iqtxd2,Let's all mail them in!
11670,iqtxd2,"Yes this is the path we must take. These politicians are making decisions that are forcing small businesses to close down permanently, and they are fine with that. If they force others to follow strict rules so should they. They need to be accountable for the actions they enforce. Why do they get a free pass and I dont?"
11671,iqtxd2,Where did you get the 98.94 number? Is that for US or world. Last I checked it was closer to 99.6 in the US and for people under 50 the number wasn't even worth calculating.
11672,iqtxd2,"That whole 98.94% survive number is not a good talking point.  If 70% of the US needs to get the virus to get herd immunity, then that means the 1.06% mortality rate will claim 2.4 million American‚Äôs lives."
11673,iqtxd2,"I see, but until the law changes, it should be followed."
11674,iqtxd2,But my hair!
11675,iqtxd2,You don't matter
11676,iqtxd2,Nope. Cops that speed should be fined too. Laws apply equally. Even the petty laws like ‚Äúwear a mask‚Äù
11677,iqtxd2,No because when the shoe is on the other foot there is no such thing as too petty. Had this been Trump in california at a barber shop she would be calling for impeachment.
11678,iqtxd2,"Petty? No, people on the left have been calling for people to be fined, if they don‚Äôt have a mask outside. Which is Absurd. In the beginning when masks were mandated there were posts all over reddit on the left channels showing other countries dining their people for not wearing masks. You guys are hypocrites to the tenth degree."
11679,iqtxd2,Shes irrelevant. She made a fortune singing about her bad choices in men and then tells us how to choose a man to lead us. She got corrupted by hollywood.
11680,iqtxd2,"It's crazy that there's a huge part of this population that doesn't see this.

Democrats smile a lot and people instantly trust them, its disturbing."

11689,iqtxd2,That‚Äôs not the point. Pelosi tried to make this woman look like a criminal while she was breaking restrictions. Rules for thee but not for me.
11690,iqtxd2,Have you ever paid rent in SF? $300k might cover 12 months tops. Hardly a landslide victory.
11691,iqtxd2,Just guessing you‚Äôve never run a business...
11692,iqtxd2,"You forgot whatever Fox news paid her.  Pelosi didn't destroy her livelihood, she chose to do this to herself.  SHE made the appointment, SHE took the video to the newstation.  Try to to keep up."
11693,iqtxd2,What if the owner didn‚Äôt do it?
11694,iqtxd2,"Incorrect, the committee ruled that Russia engaged in an aggressive multifaceted effort to influence or attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. That does not mean that there was collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign - only that an attempt was made on the part of the Russians, big difference."
11695,iqtxd2,"Right, Hillary's campaign staff. Don't try to flip the script"
11696,iqtxd2,HORSE HOCKEY just more Democrat lies you are listening to too much Democrat propaganda.
11697,iqtxd2,If you don't know you shouldn't be voting look it up on the net.

11702,iqtxd2,"Yeah I was just asking because I don‚Äôt really pay much attention bro. I have literally tunnel vision right now. Like the only thing that matters to me is what matters to me.

11703,iqtxd2,"Well, if you're saying they should be prosecuted for the mandates that they have crafted that costs livelihoods then I wholly support that.

11705,iqtxd2,Is there a Law? I don't think there is a LAW.

#BUTTRUMP 

folks.


And those from /r/SelfAwarewolves 

You've missed the point entirely.  This is the argument you have been throwing at Republicans for years now.

It's just mirrored to you now, and you don't like it.

You think that YOU are the only ones who get to say things like this...

The vids of Joe feeling kids are kinda gross.  I think most people find Tara Reade's story to be believable.

Additionally, Bill Clinton spoke at the DNC and, well, ew....

Because Clinton has more damning Epstein connections than Trump does.  I know that you need and want to BUTTRUMP....BUT...

Trump kicked Epstein out of Mar a Lago.

https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/510604-book-claims-trump-barred-epstein-from-mar-a-lago-after-financier-hit

In the ""Surviving Jeffrey Epstein"" series, you see one of Epstein's victims claim that he recorded things and had the dirt on people to the point where he said that people thought they were using HIM...but in fact, HE WAS manipulating people.

Maybe that's why NO ONE BUT TRUMP cooperated with the first Epstein prosecutor.

https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/07/prosecutor-in-2009-epstein-case-said-donald-trump-was-the-only-one-who-helped-him/

Now... we see you all buttrumping, but when you do it... you must also acknowledge that Biden is creepy with little girls, he has a credible allegation of rape against him and Bill Clinton just spoke at the DNC.

Have a lovely evening.  Watch some of the convention!"
11730,igex7g,I‚Äôm confused...is Biden a Pedo now?

Umm, Tara Reade would like a word with you. The fact that we have video evidence of him fondling little girls is far worse than the unsubstantiated claims against Trump.

Wanting a fair election now means he won't accept defeat?

> has happily colluded with a malevolent foreign power

Yea... sure bud. No obstruction, no collusion. 

> has happily colluded with a malevolent foreign power

This is actually false. https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/does-trump-owe-millions-of-dollars

> brags about sexually assaulting women

This has never happened. ""...they let you grab them by the pussy..."" This implies consent. The context is that when you are as rich as Trump, women are willing to throw themselves at you.

> lies about being a Christian

No one on Earth can determine whether Trump is honest in his declaration of faith. If he is honest in it, then he still came to Christianity fairly recently, 2014-2015. 

Also, the only instances I kind fond of Trump ""mocking religion"" is a statement he made about Romney and Pelosi.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong, nor do I like people who say, ‚ÄòI pray for you‚Äô when they know that that‚Äôs not so.""

But, this is not mocking religion, this is him calling their character into question. Faith should not be used to justify something that is wrong, because wrongdoings are not justified through faith. Also, someone lying about praying for someone is also a no-no in Christianity.

This is exactly why independents and conservatives find people like you annoying as hell. You accuse anyone who disagrees with you of being racist. That's a very low-IQ move. You're voting for Biden, presumably? What do you have to say about his racist gaffes? Poor kids are just as smart as white kids? He learned about roaches? If you don't vote for him you *ain't* black? Is there a vacuum in your head that just shits all these facts out into the abyss? If Trump had said these things, you'd be all over it like white on rice. 
And I saw a glimpse of your reply before it got deleted or disappeared. That's real cute that you mention the *""fine people on both sides""* although that's been debunked and clarified over and over. Trump wasn't talking about white supremacists. He even denounced white supremacists afterward. If you're so smart, go check out his quote in full context. Remember *context clues* you learned in the 3rd grade? Practice with that exercise.

Lastly, I'm not voting for Trump because I ride his jock. I'm voting for Trump because Biden/Harris is a terrible ticket and because of liberals constantly telling me I'm racist because I'm not progressive. I'm tired of left-wing news narratives trying to convince white America that they're all racist - and that they need to tone it down. I'm voting for Trump because I'm sick of progressive race baiters like yourself."

11906,igex7g,">  they run music over the video because you can hear it in the long versions of the tape, in the long forms of the videos with the actual audio, you can sometimes hear him giving encouragement. It really is a new low in American politics.
 I am not certain of what you are saying?  There are several sites which have gone through and shown the videos with audio, much of which taken from a specific photo shoot Biden did a while back.  It is all available.  Most on here would not be amenable to hearing the actual audio and what he is saying to the kids, because it would make them traitors to have an opinion crafted by the actual situations. It is far easier to have a fiction based on small clips cut with creepy music than it is to sit down and watch many many minutes of video.  

I used the video above as an example, because the guy is wholesome as Mr Rogers when it comes to his interactions with children.  Without context of what he is saying it ""looks"" bad, when framed to a specific context. IE If you have confidence that the people seeing it will:

1. Trust you completely out of loyalty
2. Ignore  any other information out of loyalty 
3. Will self adjust the narrative out of loyalty, to find something bad in it, even when there wasn't anything bad at all.

The videos showing him adjust the shoulders of kids for photos, many of these photos are printed and cherished possessions of their families, and him at funerals of his son, and other public events.  

The reason the ""main stream media"" isn't covering this stuff is because it is a fabricated lie.  All of these children exist, they could be interviewed, the ones in the photo shoots emphasized are actual children of senators and house members, many from the opposing party, and none of them have come forward to say ""My daughter/son felt as if they were being groped.""  

Why would they not do that?  If the video evidence is so compelling? SO now you would have to retreat to conspiracy, that all of these Democrat and Republican house and senate members secretly let their kids be groped by Joe Biden, and that Joe Biden gropes his own grand children.

The other part, the still photos, many of them are just outright photoshops that I have seen, of people he never  met, and some aren't even photos from this country. But I doubt anyone will let the truth bother them from a fiction they would rather believe.  

I would post links, but it literally is more trivial to find this stuff on google than it is to find this thread r/conservative at this point.  You literally have to have 0 intellectual curiosity on how absurd this seems to believe that Joe Biden is a pedophile or creepy, because of how easy it is to debunk."

12093,ifaxt6,Yeah man
12094,ifaxt6,Judging by his previous posts it is Argentina.
12095,ifaxt6,"Venezuela is just ruined thru sanctions by the US and failed attempts to take the control of the the country and take their oil, America has never done anything good about central and South America."
12096,ifaxt6,"A majority of the time, when I see people use the term ""socialist"", they are conservatives describing liberal policies.  I can't attest for everyone and I'm positive there are left-wing extremists who call for anarchy or socialism and label themselves as such, but ""Socialism"" is far more often a Conservative buzzword from my experience."
12097,ifaxt6,they probably have lower cognitive ability
12098,ifaxt6,"I‚Äôm not republican, just like you, but probably not all like you because I‚Äôm bot a leftist or socialist lib. I‚Äôm pro small government and pro capitalism. Ideally, there would no bail out for corporations or people. Both corps and people would have a better chance of getting through this recession caused by the pandemic if government intervened less and allowed businesses to open and by never having placed such high taxes on people. I‚Äôm going off on a lot of my own viewpoints. Anyways, those are my opinions. In this situation though, yeah if the government is going to bail out corps they should bail out people too. Having said that, many that have lost their job because of Covid have received great unemployment benefits and the $1200. That should have more than helped with rent, food, and whatever else these past few months."
12099,ifaxt6,When ?
12100,ifaxt6,"He proposed a MARGINAL tax rate of 70%, establishing that all income over 10 million per year would be taxed at that rate.  Anything under and you'd be in the top tax bracket which is somewhere around 30%, but most wealthy people have great accountants and tax specialists that can reduce that number significantly.  I think back when Mitt Romney was running for pres, he paid like 16% in taxes and made millions.  The same year, I paid 22% and I made under 30,000."
12101,ifaxt6,So that one thing the supreme court would slap down ruins it all?
12102,ifaxt6,"Social democrats adopted a ""democratic capitalism"" after war in EU.  Nordic model, Dirigisme and Rhenish model are forms of Social Democracy seen in EU nowadays. 

Pre war Social Democrats were different than today."
12103,ifaxt6,"Well then you have to remember that Northern Europeans on average don‚Äôt have cars like us and get taxed way too high. Also a lot of conservatives say that Northern Europeans only work because their population is 5-10 million. Me personally, I don‚Äôt believe that. I think they do so well simply because of their natural resources. Just like the middle east, which is also very wealthy. And then on top of them living low income lives due to taxes prisoners cost 120k each there which is retarded. The only reason they can ‚Äúplease someone‚Äù I believe is their econ. If they weren‚Äôt living where they were stable funding outside of taxes would crush them."
12104,ifaxt6,"Around 150.000 swedes lives in the US. And around 100.000 lives in Norway. Most of them because of work. There are no data to suggest what you are saying is true. Besides that one article you posted, and that source  is dodgy as hell.

&#x200B;

But it's true with a high number of rape in Sweden. It's among the highest in the world. But they rank below the US in Crime. And shootings US ""wins"" without contest. You should tell your cousin that, so he can move back and be safer ;)"
12105,ifaxt6,"I completely agree, its immigration policy has been an absolute disaster, both for immigrants and the native population."
12106,ifaxt6,"Denmark is absolutely a democratic socialist country, all the top five countries swedes migrate to is either democratic socialist, or have strong proponents of democratic sosialism, like great Britain and northern Ireland.

There has also been a total DECREASE in migration since 2015, to be fair with a slight yearly increase in the after years(something like 000,1% of total population).


There is simply NOT a net native migration, with a significant number of migrants being non native immigrants to Sweden in the first place."
12107,ifaxt6,Lol
12108,ifaxt6,"Yeah, we aren't Socialist. The economy isnt controlled by the state, we have free markets and such and trade alot. Its just that we have alot Welfare and that almost all Healthcare and School are Goverment Owned and they are highly funded.

But high welfare doesnt mean Socialism."
12109,ifaxt6,"Exactly. And ""democratic socialists"" often think highly of Denmark, instead of some authoritarian socialist regimes."
12110,ifaxt6,"Venezuela went down when US stopped supporting the oil business over there. Without proper care they ruined the whole economy with their socialist reforms. It‚Äôs a difficult issue but basically they went bankruptcy after the first recession. Too much social programs without a steady economy. (which itself is a direct consequence  of the social programs)

But hard to argue about the way America handles it‚Äôs southern neighborhood, war on drugs, supporting militias and intervening in their politics in the wrong way make significant damage."
12111,ifaxt6,"\> Venezuela is just ruined thru sanctions by the US and failed attempts to take the control of the the country and take their oil 

I used to commit that mistake too, not reading the sources of the claims, so it's okay bro, but , it's factually wrong, the sanctions to Venezuela before 2019 were solely on bitcoins and in some specific politicians. That could hardly create economic problems for an entire country."
12112,ifaxt6,So it seems...
12113,ifaxt6,When it‚Äôs been ruled by a king
12114,ifaxt6,‚ÄúOne thing‚Äù
12115,ifaxt6,">Social democrats adopted a ""democratic capitalism"" after war in EU. 

And at which point they did so , have you studied the intentions of their politicians ?"
12116,ifaxt6,"That's norway with it's oil. Most of our stuff is funde by taxes, I'm not 100% sure on natural resources"
12117,ifaxt6,"Norway was pretty much a social democratic welfare state by the 1960s, and oil was discovered in 1969. It sure helped fund and support a growing welfare state, but wasn't the cause of it."
12118,ifaxt6,"I don't agree with the comments about their population, what I believe is a larger country is harder to change its laws meanwhile a smaller country is easier, as America, Brazil, Russia are ficked by its politics it would be too costly and too difficult to modify shit and they avoid doing it keeping the status quo.
 I also disagree with your comment about natural resources as [I see it as a curse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse). Some countries and places did really well with resources because they had a good government and system in place before the resource discovery, while others (like Middle East) have a worse equality and quality of life because of it. 

About the prison it is not perfect, but they have way less prisoners per capita and their prisoners are back as a member of society way faster what I believe is a good thing (spends way more for less time and with more benefits for the population) but criticism where it is due, they must lower this value."
12119,ifaxt6,"He didn't move back to the states, he moved to Australia."
12120,ifaxt6,"Also Sweden has one of the toughest sex crime legislations in the world in what it comes to defining rape. The definition is much broader and leads high number of charges and convictions. 

Apples and oranges."
12121,ifaxt6,"Personally I‚Äôm not much of a believer in immigration, I think that America is something of an exception in the world but in general I think that it‚Äôs best for everyone that they stay in their home countries with people of a similar culture and try to improve their own living situation rather than going abroad and bringing their problems there. Which is exactly what the immigrants coming to Sweden have done. The cultures coming into Sweden are completely incompatible with Swedish culture, and a variety of problems have arisen as a result of the open immigration policy for people coming from war torn third world countries."
12122,ifaxt6,"They havent been since 2015

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democrats_(Denmark)

E - ok they have been again since 2019, I need to keep abreast of Denmark elections it seems"
12123,ifaxt6,"Some of my country people do not have any interest understanding what you just said. 

Deliberately."
12124,ifaxt6,"We call countries and nations like The Soviet union socialist because that's what they call themselves. 

I don't think socialism is letting people work them to death on a railroad. Burning down your own villages because it might give you an advantage in warfare and stuff like genocide and mass killings.  
That would be a totalitarian regime and that's literally  the opposite of socialism."
12125,ifaxt6,I don't see how a monarch would help India.
12126,ifaxt6,"In the late 20th century. And not alot i can tell by first hand experience :).

I know it was twisted in the early 20th century, but in the late 20th century political shift happened with social democrats. My country has been such for a long time."
12127,ifaxt6,Fair enough
12128,ifaxt6,"This simply refers to the name of the ruling party, the country of Denmark is ABSOLUTELY a democratic socialist state...

By that logic, and I'm using the word logic pretty liberally here, north Korea is a democratic socialist country, simply because of the name."
12129,ifaxt6,"Full circle.

- Democrats suggesting idea from Northern Europe countries.
- Republicans calls Democrat idea for Socialism
- /r/Republican goes in detail how ideas from Northern Europe countries isn't actually Socialism."
12130,ifaxt6,Ok
12131,ifaxt6,"And how successful are those politicians monetarily ? Do they have a very rich a nice life ? 

>but in the late 20th century political shift happened with social democrats

If there was a document stating their intentions that the shifting in their ideology was purely to win voters in order to further advance their quest for power, would that be something that can change your mind about it ?"
12132,ifaxt6,"Kinda sad to be honest that US politics are entrenched in Tribalism and call ideas bad by calling them Buzzwords, 1984-esque, Fascist, Communist, Un-American etc. Instead of actually listing points and merits why it wouldn't work in the American system"
12133,ifaxt6,Okay
12134,ifaxt6,"Depends on the document. Is it pre war or post war era they talk about? Becouse i have heard that they did do that pre war. It's good that we did not reach full on Socialism with a dictatorship.

Even tho I live in Nordic model country and I'm enjoying my life. I hardly doubt you can change my mind with one document, but shoo give it a shot."
12135,ifaxt6,"True, ""There are some very important distinctions between, say, Denmark and North Korea. "" as mention in this thread. Where media just blatantly say just the opposite, except they change North Korea to Venezuela : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXecLXlzEXE - The reply they get from the dane, is just as you state *""We have a welfare state in our country.""*

I agree that it's sad, but at least I find some comfort that /r/republican can call the BS when they see it, at least on reddit."
12136,ifaxt6,Buddy
12137,iee3ka,I live in Michigan part time and she is truly a loser. There are a lot of signs in people‚Äôs yard that says ‚ÄúMY GOVERNOR IS AN IDIOT‚Äù. I have to agree.

I agreed with him that Obama had policies I did not like, but I did not hate him even though I voted against him.  We ended up having a meaningful conversation about how the simple presidential election process weeds out any truly ""bad"" people and it is ok to hate the policies of a person and not immediately go to ""Hitler.""

Now, that would be about 5 generations of people, which is clearly long enough not to be responsible for.  None of us are responsible for our parents' sins, let alone our great great great grandparents.  The exaggeration in this case makes it lose a bit of credibility, IMO.  "

Or maybe it isn‚Äôt..."

Being fat... maybe your fault, maybe time and skill to cook along with exercise time is a luxury not enjoyed by lower classes. Maybe healthy good food is more expensive and not accessible. Tough to tell.

Teen pregnancy / STDs... maybe your fault, maybe proper sex education and access to contraceptives is harder to access for the less wealthy. Tough to tell.

Failing out... maybe your fault, maybe wealthy parents are more educated themselves and can afford to spend more time with their children teaching them. Maybe the schools in wealthy neighborhoods are better funded. Tough to tell.

Ancestors owning slaves... definitely not your fault. But maybe it is your fault if you don‚Äôt recognize that minorities on average start out in a lower class than white people due to historical circumstances and these circumstances have a strong impact on outcomes... even though the circumstances themselves are not your fault. 

It‚Äôs also not a black persons fault that his ancestors were enslaved and they have historically been at a disadvantage ever since.

Maybe ‚Äúfault‚Äù is a complex topic that can‚Äôt be well discussed in 140 characters or a meme. Tough to tell.

PS please don‚Äôt come at me with anecdotal evidence of impoverished white guy who pulled himself out of poverty etc etc. I know it happens. It happens with minorities as well. But on average someone who starts poor is likely to end up poor, regardless of race. Poverty is a trap. Some can get out, most can‚Äôt.

Native Americans and free blacks also owned slaves."

2. Teen pregnancy is often a result of lack of sexual education (something Republicans are generally against) and bad parenting 


3. Dropping out of high school can be an effect of a million causes out of your control that all build up to that decision, we're all largely shaped by our environment 


4. See 2 


5. No one blames any individual for what their ancestors have done, claiming that's what people say is a logical fallacy called a strawman. When people say ""white people"" are the cause of why black people are poor and live in slums, they mean the hundreds of years of slavery, segregation and systemic oppression that caused that to happen. You don't have to feel bad for that, in fact that would be silly because you have nothing to do with what your ancestors did, but you do have to be aware of it if you want to find solutions to that problem.

12526,aemlra,"Well I would say Germans are responsible to remember those years truthfully and stare down the shame with honesty to insure nothing of the sort ever comes close to happening again.  The same should go with Americans.  

It‚Äôs not ok to enslave a population for 200 years and then after they are freed spend another 100 years oppressing/incarcerating  them just so modern Americans can ask why are ‚Äúthey‚Äù so backwards. Just simple acknowledgement of the historical situation explains so much about why things are the way they are today. 

The truth is there‚Äôs not much one singular person can do to change anything but know the history still effects us today and act accordingly. Shut down racism when you see it and pass these qualities to your kids. Time and understanding is the only solution."

12528,aemlra,People who call you racist simply for being white
12529,aemlra,It's hard to say that our great grandparents or any family members owned any slaves. Most people migrated to the US after slavery. Even if they were here before hand then the percentage of people who actually owned slaves is even smaller.
12530,aemlra,"True, but some of our parents may have been advocates for racial segregation only 60 years ago..."
12531,aemlra,Not every white guy 150 years ago was a slave owner. Mainly it was the upper class / plantation owners / farmers. Now how about racist? Probably. But that‚Äôs not on us. The half a millennium for slabs owning however is most realistic to the majority of the white population because you would have distant relatives that probably dealt with slave owning.

Why am I responsible for that? I work to make my life better for myself and my family. I wasn‚Äôt dealt a great hand either. Nobody cares. Historical injustices don‚Äôt matter to me because they have nothing to do with me. I treat everyone I see with respect and compassion. What else am I supposed to do?  Feel guilty?  Fuck that. Not happening. I have no reason to. And no one should have any reason to care about my injustices either. It‚Äôs not their problem. "

Now, I guess I could be crucified because my great whatever grandfather carried supplies during the civil war, though he never fought directly, as far as she could tell.

12581,aemlra,Most liberals
12582,aemlra,"If you want a really bad example, see Robert Sapolsky‚Äôs book Behave: The Biology of Humans At Our Best and Worst. It‚Äôs an interesting book about neuroscience, but by the time you get to chapter 16 he will make materialist assumptions and bad philosophical arguments to say that we need to abolish the criminal justice system and that you have no free will to speak of. I think many people are being passively moved into this mindset nowadays, and it follows from this line of flawed reasoning that if you can‚Äôt do otherwise due to lack of free will and biological conditioning - that *any* retributive justice is wrong. 

I dare say that you meet these people who have adopted these ideas frequently - have you ever met someone who believes that the justice system should only ever have reform, but never retribution? Should that guy who raped and murdered ten little girls get the death penalty? No way say the reform ‚Äúno free will‚Äù crowd, he couldn‚Äôt do otherwise and you don‚Äôt destroy a malfunctioning machine, you fix it. (this is obviously barring any discoverable serious mental deficiency, those are already taken into account in our current justice system. Sapolsky argues that understanding our biology even better in the future will lead to the complete dissolution of any free choice to speak of)

I also want to add, some of you may think that retributive justice is bad, that it is merely society taking out irrational rage against the punished. Consider as a contrast just what the state would be empowered to do if this were true. There would be absolutely no limits on what they would be required to do to ‚Äúfix‚Äù criminality, nor any limit to the lengths of time assigned to make it happen. Think of the societal manipulation that they would extend themselves to, the drug conditioning that would be frequently used... Lets just say - things could always be worse..."
12583,aemlra,Yes they do as I know people that say this stuff
12584,aemlra,"Liberal here. Anyone who tried to make you feel guilty for being white is just a moron but if we‚Äôre 20 years removed from outright racism in the public sphere then doesn‚Äôt that say something about the difference between being black and being white in this country, regardless of what your father might have done?"
12585,aemlra,"Fun fact: decriminalizing drugs would not only help the drug problem tremendously, it would also save taxpayer dollars and help secure our borders. To top it all of it‚Äôs more in line with smaller government.

Here‚Äôs why- Less people would use hard drugs, this is because similar to booze in the prohibition people that want it are going to get it. No matter what. But treating it as a healthcare issue and decriminalizing it means those who are addicted and want to stop will have better resources to do so.  People use drugs as an escape, throwing them in jail only makes their lives worse so they will continue to need an escape. The decriminalization overall leads to a long term drop in drug use. (See Portugal)
It saves taxpayer dollars because less people in jail means less money going to privatized prisons. Since those are paid per bed filled.
Here‚Äôs my favorite part- it helps secure our borders because the refugees that come in through the southern border are doing so because cartels which make their money off selling drugs are rich and powerful enough to destabilize the local governments. With their largest cash flow (drugs are cheaper when decriminalized because of lower demand) cut down local governments can once again take control of their countries. Even if they aren‚Äôt perfect these governments we can all agree are probably better than criminal cartels. That means less refugees coming up through Mexico to America, since now they don‚Äôt have some cartel leader killing them for whatever reason.

Bonus points! Local economies do better because parents who would have otherwise gone to jail from the war on drugs instead are there for their families. This means more workers, students who do better, less crime and less disenfranchisement in these communities."
12586,aemlra,How
12587,aemlra,"Right, so as long as they all fall in line with the right way of thinking, your way of thinking, then they are racist.   There is absolutely no other way to look at the situation, because looking at it from any other viewpoint is racist and we have a duty to call those people out. 

 I don't know what morally reprehensible views you believe are socially acceptable.  Please tell me a few. "
12588,aemlra,"Again they aren't taking a moral high ground. They're just saying it's dumb to excuse actual mistakes and damn those who happen to be born white. 

Problem is that so many people have it ingrained that it isn't their fault that logically pointing out that them say, not finishing high school is on them for not putting in the effort and not whatever excuse they give just pisses people off. "
12589,aemlra,It's about personal responsibility and how society will sometimes hold someone responsible for things they cannot control and fail to hold them responsible for the things they can.

12606,aemlra,You don‚Äôt know most liberals then. At least IRL. 
12607,aemlra,Because people believe it and in this case as in many it isn‚Äôt reflective of the truth.
12608,aemlra,"If they think or do any of the following they are racist -races should be segregated- that a race is superior for any reason- a particular race is lesser for any reason- people of a certain race are more prone to criminal or unethical activity due to their race or racial culture- if they would prefer not to see or hear a particular race in their space- an employer who only hires a certain race for a certain job- a customer who thinks a certain way about an establishment because people of a retain race work there- that list is non-exhaustive but I hope it helps you get the general picture.  To be racist is to classify someone according to their race in a manor other than descriptive.

And because racism is a prejudice, we do have an ethical obligation to  not accept it. I won‚Äôt say everyone has an ethical obligation to say something, because obligations to take actions are more complicated than obligations to not accept them. The fact that certain groups in certain places do accept some of the above views is what makes them socially acceptable. By definition.

It is our job to claim our own house. If we want the Republican Party to be respectable nationally, on the world stage and historically when all is said and done we can‚Äôt let anyone else do it for us. We need to call out members of our party who don‚Äôt live up to basic ethical standards, because if we don‚Äôt history will. And we will be judged."

BLM on the other hand, would argue that white people owe restitutions to the African American community for the crimes their ancestors committed generations ago when it comes to slavery. 

I think it‚Äôs fair to say that there are certain people who would fall into both parties and would have both beliefs.

I agree that the son, who inherited wealth under those circumstances doesn‚Äôt have as much of a right to that wealth as the people that it was stolen from, but now, we are in a more civilized time, this isn‚Äôt game of thrones where you wage war because you believe you have more of a right to the ‚Äòthrone‚Äô than the person sitting on it.

12649,aemlra,So because I‚Äôm black automatically I don‚Äôt have an education? Go away loser 
12650,aemlra,"No. I'm not. 

I just have 0 tolerance for retarded shit like fighting cops and calling them racists when you get gunned down. 

OF COURSE the cops shot you when you went for the gun. And the ones who you see on TV screaming cops are racist when they get pulled over almost inevitably have some kind of drug or gun on them illegally.

Saying I'm racist for expecting someone to understand the logic of attacking someone with a gun leads to your ass getting blown away is pretty retarded. 

I don't give a shit who you are, what you call yourself, or what you do to yourself so long as it doesn't affect me, you're in the country legally, and you aren't trying to shove it in my face or force it upon me.

So fuck off with that Racism shit. "

12653,aemlra,"Thanks for the well thought out response.  I also can appreciate your side of the argument, but I do hope that If I do good in this life that that the ripple effects of that good will carry forward and benefit my offspring and descendants on down. Should we not have the same expectations for our actions of malice and oppression?

I also agree that figuring out what the reparations should be is a near impossible task, but perhaps helping to erase some of the historical burden of lack of educational opportunities and housing discrimination is not too much to ask?"
12654,aemlra,"I just think sharing memes like this promotes anger and hate on both sides and most of the time are misleading. Our country was never this divided and now it feels like we are rooting for our ‚Äúteam‚Äù. And both sides have a tribal dedication to whichever side they are on. No matter what our team does we rationalize it as being ok but anything from the other side is outrageous. 

We all need to first become aware of this and try not to be another follower. Do research and really try to understand the why. And do it with an open mind, not with a goal of proving a side wrong. Then, we can start to work together and get rid of a whole lotta hate.

Eric Gardner was strangled to death on the street for selling cigarettes. His last words on this Earth were """"I can't breathe"". No consequences. Walter Scott was shot IN THE BACK multiple times while fleeing. Botham Jean was shot to death in his own home by a drunken cop who broke in, thinking it was hers.

I do not believe it is just for the sons and daughters of people they have never met to be responsible to the harm caused on other people they have never met. I do acknowledge the fact that some people are born better off because they are sitting on a pile cash that was ‚Äòearned‚Äô by ripping people off and oppressing people. However, as someone who was most definitely not born on that pile, I don‚Äôt think I should be lumped into that category based on the color of my skin. Yes most people who are rich are white males, but that does not mean all whites, and all men are in that same boat. This labeling and lumping people into categories turned me away from the left. I was born into a blue collar family barely making ends meet. A meal was never guaranteed. It seems that in today‚Äôs political climate, my skin color invalidates that. I agree that some people are sitting on a pile of stolen cash, but it‚Äôs not your neighbors, it‚Äôs the people sitting in their ivory towers, so far removed from the common person. These are the people that should be questioned."
12660,aemlra,"To comment on your edit, I agree wholeheartedly. Economically I lean more left, socially I‚Äôm more right leaning.  However I think that money needs to be put into education across the board. Taxes, I believe are the payment to be allowed to live in a society. One of the benefits is education, however many schools across the country are struggling financially, which is terrible. The children have no power over it and are going to be at a severe disadvantage due to it. Something needs to be done about that because everyone deserves a fair shake when it comes to education. However, I‚Äôm not that smart, I don‚Äôt have an idea on how it can be fixed, I hope that someone smarter than I am can figure it out because yes, right now, education is fucked. "

12662,aemlra,"Well I see what your saying, but for the left, they hate to see the right kick out illegal immigrants, and for the right, we hate to see unborn babies killed.
While I completely agree with you on the we should not be divided part, I disagree one the rationalize as being okay part. I believe in almost every conservative thing being for the better, not all but almost.

12691,ifsgr4,"I did a research paper about police brutality and I found three issues that lead to it. This video highlights the most serious of the three issues. Cops have severe PTSD and in my opinion it‚Äôs worse than military vets. The issue isn‚Äôt the PTSD itself but actually the lack of support to handle the trauma. The secondary issue to this is incredibly poor quality training. 

Once you have an encounter like this you will never be the same but if you have enough time you will be able to put away the trauma and work through it. Cops do not have a support system in place for dealing with this serious issue. So they are exposed to sever levels of trauma daily which quite literally de-humanizes them to the point where they are unable to relate and empathize with those around them. 

This is why we see so many videos of cops beating people for seemingly no reason. They see every citizen as this guy in the video. Cops need mental health support and training/education that actually helps them with these types of interactions."

Yeah most suicides I would imagine the person probably just wants to end their own suffering and truly isn‚Äôt worried about anyone else but there is always a chance for anything to happen and when dealing with an incredibly unstable person it only makes it that much more of an unpredictable situation.  Someone steeling from a store is not even close to the same thing.  when someone steels something it‚Äôs probably because they‚Äôre strapped on cash and hungry and although they likely have little regard for whoever the store owner is it‚Äôs not even close to the same as someone who‚Äôs on the verge of ending their entire existence on this earth. which would mean they‚Äôre as unstable as one could possibly ever be.

Also, on the Jacob Blake case I agree that it was dangerous what he was doing but I also feel that there was likely many ways they could have stopped him from getting to the door.

12776,ifsgr4,"Edit\*: I was incorrect re: 1000 unarmed. It was 1000 total. Of that, 17% unarmed for black, average of 13% for other. Call it 14.5% avg unarmed and its 145 unarmed. In that case, it is 145 unarmed deaths vs 48 police deaths.

The FBI states that 89 police officers were killed in the line of duty in 2019 with 48 of those resulting from a felonious act. The other 41 were deemed accidents.

In the same year, 145\* unarmed citizens were killed by police.

I don't believe that anyone is saying that those 89 or 48 officers should have died, but the overly aggressive and escalation-based tactics of police departments are directly responsible for those extra 145\* deaths.

Being an officer can be dangerous, clearly, but by treating every interaction as if everyone is out to get them, police cause triple\* the death. Deaths of people like that one lady who was literally asleep.

That is why people are upset."

12781,ifsgr4,Sure. Just don‚Äôt choke people to death. Honest question. Why do cops always feel the need to sit on people let alone continue to choke them after they get cuffs on people.

12793,ifsgr4,According to who? I've seen liberal subs applaud this video and the cops a few months ago. Why do immediately have to assume the worst in people?
12794,ifsgr4,"Incorrect, this dude wasn‚Äôt backing away with his hands up. Yes it does matter what danger the supposed perpetrators was threatening, but typically police brutality isn‚Äôt when someone is shooting and the police are shooting back, that‚Äôs tit for tat and makes sense."
12795,ifsgr4,"53-100 years in prison, unless woke culture gets him pardoned"
12796,ifsgr4,He was a peaceful jogger planning to murder 2 police officers! #BLM
12797,ifsgr4,It‚Äôs removed
12798,ifsgr4,Because police have been ordered not to use tactics and holds that would end the fight because they are ‚Äútoo dangerous.‚Äù
12799,ifsgr4,They need fast cars tho if someone is going 80 miles and hour they have to wait a few seconds to get out into the road then they need to get way over 80 just to catch the person. I am not trying to argue I am just trying to point out that they do need some really fast cars.
12800,ifsgr4,Why?  It‚Äôs pointless.
12801,ifsgr4,"Fully agree that‚Äôs why I think we need better training, better allocation of funds and increased budget. I wish everyone could look at issues like this intellectually like you and not scream abolish the police"
12802,ifsgr4,You know it! Check [this ](https://www.change.org/p/pennsylvania-state-senate-exonerate-daniel-k-clary-by-reason-of-self-defense) out
12803,ifsgr4,HOw dAre U cOnsider PoLicE hUmAn!!
12804,ifsgr4,Well if they can't control their fear of everyone and everything enough to stop themselves from shooting an unarmed man in the back seven times then they need to find another job and perhaps get some therapy.

12806,ifsgr4,[removed]
12807,ifsgr4,Suck a dick you racist piece of trash.
12808,ifsgr4,It is because he attacked the cops.  Has nothing to do with race.  Only the left can make everything a race issue.
12809,ifsgr4,People defending him of course claim racism and applaud him for shooting the cops. It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. They glorify and martyrize thugs and then play the victim and/or race card when someone gets arrested for their shitty actions. But it‚Äôs everyone else‚Äôs fault but theirs. Wah wah wah.
12810,ifsgr4,How about every state for themselves so the ones who voted the democrats who allow these riots to happen can‚Äôt just flee state when it goes to shit and do the same there
12811,ifsgr4,"And everyone screams racism and police brutality because they‚Äôre to lazy to look up the full video. Even then, they‚Äôve made up their mind that any black man who is arrested by cops is the victim even if they‚Äôve resisted arrest."

12813,ifsgr4,"Holy shit, who the fuck looks at this and thinks ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just self defense I would have done the same‚Äù"
12814,ifsgr4,Agreed
12815,ifsgr4,"Agreed but some of these people are making it out to be like it‚Äôs racists cops shooting a black man when in all likely hood they thought he was going for a gun. He had multiple warrants for violent crimes and they had gotten reports he was armed. When you don‚Äôt listen to police things can go wrong quickly, it was a tragic incident."
12816,ifsgr4,"Real piece of shit, hope he‚Äôll enjoy the prison showers for the next 100 years. He got the sentence he deserves."
12817,ifsgr4,Yup and they refuse to even acknowledge that the ‚Äúprotests‚Äù are ruining the their cities
12818,ifsgr4,How dare they form an opinion based upon video evidence!
12819,ifsgr4,Top comment is ‚Äùhe deserves lethal injection. Let his ass rot‚Äù and then his mother comments on it trying to say that it was just self defense when he was obviously going for the gun all along and refused the officers orders.
12820,ifsgr4,What are the obvious reasons?
12821,ifsgr4,"Exactly, tragic but easily avoidable."
12822,ifsgr4,"This exactly. If you are respectful to polic eand you didnt do somthing terrible or dangerous they will usually work with you. The left likes to call this favortisim towards white people, but I know many people of other races that get off with warnings for speeding and stuff because they are respectful. Sure there might be some POS officers out there but just because there are a few bad apples dosent mean you should be a dick to all of them"
12823,ifsgr4,How is this even remotely relevant to this post? Or are you just a propoganda bot?
12824,ifsgr4,Haha bet he‚Äôd make sure he was pardoned
12825,ifsgr4,The first thing the cops do when he falls on the road is to look for cars and run to pull him off the road. They truly tried too keep him safe and not to have to use their guns.. and still he tried to kill them. I kinda wish he‚Äôd been run over so they didn‚Äôt have to get shot.
12826,ifsgr4,He will spend 50-100 years in prison unless some woke asshole pardons him
12827,ifsgr4,Assumed that was the Kyle Dinkheller link. The audio from that vid is the worst part.
12828,ifsgr4,Agreed. The black community needs to change their mindset on criminality and education just as much as the cops need reform like better training and increased funds.
12829,ifsgr4,"I agree that theres injustice in the system and that there are a lot of shitty police. But you have to give credit when it‚Äôs deserved. Don‚Äôt we need to set examples what a good police should be? You can‚Äôt say all police are evil because some are racist ass holes, that would be like saying all black peoples are criminals because there‚Äôs a lot of blacks that commit crime."
12830,ifsgr4,"Need better police training and increased budget, I think most republicans agree."
12831,ifsgr4,"I don‚Äôt know, since there isn‚Äôt any video of it going down it‚Äôs hard to say what exactly happened. Shots were fired towards the police and the police shot back, that‚Äôs all we know for certain at this point. Hopefully more evidence will be revealed during the trials. Police misconduct certainly occurred and I hope they get punished for it but if they deserve 100 years in jail like this guy I‚Äôm not sure about.  It‚Äôs 2 very different situations."
12832,ifsgr4,Bull shit. The responsibility is on the criminal fuck that shit. The cops shouldn‚Äôt have to wait to be shot at before they return fire. Put a bullet right through that asshole‚Äôs brain. You want to be a piece of shit? Expect the consequences. Pretty simple.
12833,ifsgr4,"Tbh, even if you manage to outrun these 2 cops, you're not out running the whole police force. Just idiotic to try and resist arrest and run."
12834,ifsgr4,"Outstanding warrant that's going to put you back in prison for the next 10 years? I always remember an episode of cops where a young kid gets pulled over for a traffic violation. The police find drugs stashed in his shoes. They cuff him as they're going though the drugs. He makes a sudden mad dash into traffic to get away, but they catch him almost immediately. They ask him why he ran and he replied - "" I just wanted to see if I could get a few more moments of freedom."""
12835,ifsgr4,Everyone agrees that cops need better training and you don‚Äôt get that by cutting the budget
12836,ifsgr4,BLM might have threatened them and rioted outside their house so that even their wife‚Äôs had to divorce them. Seem familiar? ;)
12837,ifsgr4,Except that 10% of the comments are about how the cops deserved to be shot and various other horrendous things. When you don‚Äôt listen to the police and rush to your car you should be shot.
12838,ifsgr4,They probably should have shot him there tbh. When he started running towards the car.
12839,ifsgr4,You watch too many movies.
12840,ifsgr4,I saw some tazer bullets that can be loaded into a normal gun but that kind of stuff is expensive as shit. Maybe if we increase police funding it could happen
12841,ifsgr4,"Tranq Darts... You need to wake up, Devecchio"
12842,ifsgr4,Except he had a gun under his seat and they had gotten a call that he was armed... 100% justified in shooting him since he did not comply and he was reaching for something. No where in the rest of the world would people get upset over this and riot. Foreign media doesn‚Äôt have a political agenda so they don‚Äôt have to try to start protests.
12843,ifsgr4,"The guy shot yesterday had been arrested for hiding a gun under the seat of the VERY SAME CAR that he was trying to get into when he got himself shot.

You forget that the officers are given all that information over the radio.

They knew they were dealing with a wanted felon who had hidden guns under the seat of that same car in the past...that idiot should have just went to jail, he chose the hostpital instead....case closed."
12844,ifsgr4,"https://youtu.be/yfi3Ndh3n-g 

Watch this. 

He had a gun, and he could have shot them both before they could have reacted. I wonder how people get so delusional that they think every time someone dies it‚Äôs police brutality.  Only in America have I seen people view this as such, the rest of the world seems to understand that when a police gets a call that there‚Äôs a armed man with multiple warrants on him including serious domestic abuse and resists to reaches into his car to grab something that you shoot unless you want to die."
12845,ifsgr4,"Only have to be wrong once though, and the officers not going home. Here‚Äôs a hint: comply."
12846,ifsgr4,I think most probably would have hit that shot quite easily but you have to take into consideration that they were being shot at also and the panic you‚Äôd probably feel. I don‚Äôt know only shot firearms at ranges and during hunting so I can‚Äôt really say.
12847,ifsgr4,And why is that?
12848,ifsgr4,There are a few videos of Jacob Blake‚Äôs shooting and from a different angle. And are you saying this video is partial? It shows what led up to this guy shooting the cops.
12849,ifsgr4,"He has karambit knife in his hand, had raped and beat a woman and was rusning till his car while being told to stop where he could have grabbed a gun... unarmed my ass.

Enjoy being a brainwashed tool for elites I won‚Äôt play their games at least.


https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jacob-Blake-Knife-In-Hand-728x381-1.jpg"
12850,ifsgr4,"He was told to stop resisting and he was forcing his way to the car to grab something, he had a gun under his seat... are you serious?"
12851,ifsgr4,"Sounds like you know much more about the Kenosha shooting than the rest of the world. Can you share some links? I only see the 10 sec clip of the officers screaming at him to stop, with their guns out, and he still goes to his car opens the door and bends down like he‚Äôs getting something. Very little details from what I saw. Would love to read up on the info you have though"
12852,ifsgr4,Is this sarcasm?
12853,ifsgr4,"Actually most of Europe see the American democrats, black life‚Äôs matter, the riots and antifa as a joke. The republicans are viewed quite preferably compared to them. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt see BLM riots here, there were some protests here as well when they first started but unlike American democrats our politicians arrested anyone who rioted and shut them down within a day or two. This comes from someone who lives in Europe..."
12854,ifsgr4,"Except that he ha multiple warrants for domestic abuse among other things. They had been informed that he was armed and he had a gun under his seat. 100% justified in shooting someone who doesn‚Äôt comply and reaches into the car to grab something. Only in America do people view this as some kind of police brutality the rest of the world thinks this is what a cop should have done in that situation. No European news outlet that I‚Äôve seen has reported it as such, maybe because they don‚Äôt have a political agenda they try to force onto everything."
12855,ifsgr4,"It was a gun he shot them both, one of them was in a coma for 14 days but luckily survived"
12856,ifsgr4,Uh... what video did you watch? This guy was not subdued and shot them.
12857,ifsgr4,I know. As if somehow this justifies them shooting an unarmed man 7 times in the back. These are supposedly the trained professionals earning over $100k/year. I want my money back.
12858,ifsgr4,One was in a coma for 12 days but it looks like they‚Äôre both okay. This was in 2018
12859,ifsgr4,"[No, luckily another comment found the news story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/ifsgr4/with_police_brutality_at_the_forefront_of_the/g2pl60n?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"
12860,ifsgr4,"Yup, harsh, full on gun battle. We don't need this guy back on the street. 

Watching this would convince any cop that nothing good will happen when allowing the perp access to the vehicle."
12861,ifsgr4,"Smh...couldn‚Äôt even watch the full, short video before making an ignorant comment like that. Just imagine how many people saw and commented and never even finished watching...disgraceful. But at least you saw the error in your ways..."
12862,ifsgr4,"""They didn't have to shoot him""  =some liberal idiot somewhere. 
You couldn't pay me any amount of money to be a cop right now"
12863,ifsgr4,Why am I not surprised? We live in the era of where some criminals have more rights then their victims...
12864,ifsgr4,What in the actual fuck
12865,ifsgr4,And his momma... I see why he was such a scumbag. Coddled even after the verdict.
12866,ifsgr4,Officers should alsp respond to potential suicides. Someone who has lost the value of their life may have also lost the value of another person's life and may turn violent. Very dangerous situation to thrust an unarmed social worker into on their own.
12867,ifsgr4,"When people start talking about sending social workers to domestic calls, [I always think of this police call.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssARbfxqTh0) Domestic calls are some of the most dangerous calls that police respond to. It's going to take one or two social workers to get popped or beaten down, and we'll be right back to where we were. **NSFW**."
12868,ifsgr4,"Meter maids ‚Äî hysterical. Not analogous. And yes, cops should respond to suicide calls. Isn‚Äôt it obvious as to why?"
12869,ifsgr4,Was looking for this. Unqualified for the job like the rest of them.
12870,ifsgr4,This
12871,ifsgr4,"Edit\*: I was incorrect re: 1000 unarmed. It was 1000 total. Of that, 17% unarmed for black, average of 13% for other. Call it 14.5% avg unarmed and its 145 unarmed. In that case, it is 145 unarmed deaths vs 48 police deaths.

The FBI states that 89 police officers were killed in the line of duty in 2019 with 48 of those resulting from a felonious act. The other 41 were deemed accidents.

In the same year, 145\* unarmed citizens were killed by police.

I don't believe that anyone is saying that those 89 or 48 officers should have died, but the overly aggressive and escalation-based tactics of police departments are directly responsible for those extra 145\* deaths.

Being an officer can be dangerous, clearly, but by treating every interaction as if everyone is out to get them, police cause triple\* the death. Deaths of people like that one lady who was literally asleep.

That is why people are upset. To save the 48, you kill 145\* who didn't have anything to do with situations like the OP. And it still didn't save the 48. Seems like unsound logic."
12872,ifsgr4,Ok. I‚Äôll play the logic game with you. It‚Äôs dangerous work. Many on this thread the officers from yesterday are not at fault. Logically it follows that cops can shoot people on the grounds of ‚ÄúI thought he had a gun or was going for a gun‚Äù. You want to live in a society where cops can shoot people with impunity because they thought someone had a gun?
12873,ifsgr4,Exactly. People have family members who are cops and in their eyes they can do no wrong. It‚Äôs a shame such an important job isn‚Äôt held to a higher standard.
12874,ifsgr4,Got cancelled because some departments kept waiting for them to get there. Tv should not dictate policing.
12875,ifsgr4,"100%. Cops need MORE funding in training. I would love to see a few departments acquire a blue belt in jiu jitsu and see outcomes like this one, become a distant memory."
12876,ifsgr4,where can we get hundreds of thousands of 14-year jiu jitsu practitioners to take police jobs?
12877,ifsgr4,Too bad if any video of that leaked the cops involved would lose their jobs because that‚Äôs PoLiCe BrUtAlItY
12878,ifsgr4,A choke is a felony now in most states and until he got that gun there was no exigent circumstances so yeah choke hold would have landed them in jail now.
12879,ifsgr4,I've got a background in Judo so def. can see it too... I would love to see more law enforcement learn BJJ just for this sort of situation.  A fast and good RNC can put someone lights out so fast esp. for someone not experienced with how to resist it.
12880,ifsgr4,"Ugh, grappling training does teach chokeholds, but that chokehold is banned by almost all departments. That is a bad policy. Chokeholds should be encouraged"
12881,ifsgr4,Who are you talking about? Name one that died from choking in recent history.
12882,ifsgr4,Attempted murder over a fucking DUI. That's another level of stupid. Did he think he was just going to kill two cops and his life would go back to normal?
12883,ifsgr4,"Thank you, it was infact that incident and I remember seeing it as the headline on the local paper, I didn‚Äôt think anyone outside of PA even knew it happened. Thank you for spreading the word 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mcall.com/news/police/mc-nws-route-33-state-police-trooper-shooting-video-released-20180706-story.html%3foutputType=amp"
12884,ifsgr4,"I didn‚Äôt know about the history and the warrants, but my first reaction to the video was that there may or may not be a firearm in the vehicle and that is why he rushed around. With the current state of things in the US, I cannot imagine the thought process of these officers when events like these unfold. If they knew about the firearm, it makes it even more difficult to make a judgment call. I‚Äôm sure the left and msm will omit these facts and rile up everyone again. Really is sad."
12885,ifsgr4,I doubt you have any idea what it costs to have well trained police officers. They definitely don‚Äôt just need to reallocate funds but instead a higher budget.
12886,ifsgr4,"a lot of that fancy gear is fairly cheap, even more so since police get it 2nd hand from the military for peanuts."

12888,ifsgr4,Here is a [link](https://www.change.org/p/pennsylvania-state-senate-exonerate-daniel-k-clary-by-reason-of-self-defense) of people defending him.
12889,ifsgr4,Because we‚Äôve seen cities burning for months over - some - completely justified police actions.
12890,ifsgr4,Who was backing away with their hands up and got shot?
12891,ifsgr4,What has this got to do with blm?
12892,ifsgr4,Damn
12893,ifsgr4,I think a lot has to do with perception. There are a ton of holds that work great and literally put no one at risk. That's the training they need and then that training needs to be shared to the public so they physically see a change in tactics and get a why behind these holds. Honestly this whole situation is frustrating to me. Neither cop has a clue what to do. First off the cop closest to camera is a freaking mountain. Like use your size dude. The little cop craps his pants when he loses control. Why would you have your taser out and squat down and do nothing? You shouldn't be using a taser or even a gun in close combat like that especially when your partners could be in the cross fire so pulling a weapon made for creating and maintaining distance make sure no sense. Police need better training
12894,ifsgr4,You can hold a guy down with kneeling on his neck.
12895,ifsgr4,I can see your point and I'm not saying they need slow cars by any means. I'm sure they is something more reasonably priced and has the speed they need. Also you can't out run the radio and you can't drive with spikes in tires! I will say though the charges do look pretty sweet
12896,ifsgr4,"I‚Äôm friends with the latter half they tend to agree with me as well. People are just upset and for good reason. The police need to be held accountable for acting as judge and jury in the streets. 

Defunding is just a toxic form of that frustration. People want real change which isn‚Äôt happening because of both parties. Normal everyday people want safe streets."
12897,ifsgr4,People that run to their car or reach for their pockets while being questioned by police are the ones that need to learn to control their fear.
12898,ifsgr4,This video demonstrates why people who resist arrest get shot in the back.
12899,ifsgr4,He was on his way to church.
12900,ifsgr4,"‚ÄúClary, the shooter, offered no reaction to his verdict, with his mother, Monica Patterson, calling out to him, ‚ÄúI love you, baby,‚Äù as he was led away by deputy sheriffs.‚Äù"
12901,ifsgr4,"Please, elaborate."
12902,ifsgr4,[deleted]
12903,ifsgr4,He was mocking the left. /s means sarcasm just a heads up. Not trying to be a dick or anything to you
12904,ifsgr4,"Yes, it is sarcasm, I‚Äôm on your side ;)"
12905,ifsgr4,"My biggest fear is when I retire the places I want to move to, are ruined by these fleeing dumbocrats. üò¢üò©"
12906,ifsgr4,"It‚Äôs crazy isn‚Äôt it? Like these people are willfully being ignorant. His mom is an idiot and obviously never taught him right from wrong. I wish I could comment on that damn petition because way too many people claim it was self defense. The video on fb is edited so it starts with the cops tackling him, and all of these dimwits can‚Äôt even be bothered to look up the whole video. You can tell them to watch the whole video but a few say they don‚Äôt want to cuz it‚Äôs about time a black man fought against ‚Äúpigs‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äôve been doing this to us for 400 years. It‚Äôs self defense‚Äù. And even though they can find the full video by googling his name, many are all ‚Äúthen where‚Äôs the full video/prove it, etc.‚Äù 

Ignorance. Just pure ignorance and racism."
12907,ifsgr4,To use as an example of when it's important for officers to discharge their weapons when someone looks to be holding something and tries to enter their car.
12908,ifsgr4,"Then fire the ""bad apples"" that's literally the point. Nobody has a problem with good cops who do their jobs well, people have a problem with the POS cops that beat and shoot people for no reason, but then don't face any consequences"
12909,ifsgr4,">you are respectful to polic eand you didnt do somthing terrible or dangerous they will usually work with you

Breonna Taylor was sleeping."
12910,ifsgr4,Beep boop. I am a robot.
12911,ifsgr4,"Funny cuz thats exactly what people say and it kinda sounds what you're saying. Maybe not explicitly, but it still smacks of a dismissive disdain. "" yea the cop shouldn't have done that, but there are so many blacks committing crimes, can ya really blame the cops for shooting one in the back once in awhile?"" But to get to your main point, sure use the good ones as an example, but fix the goddamn system so this is just the norm, not a high five moement."
12912,ifsgr4,"Do you not understand why so many people hate the police? It is because the law doesn't apply to them. It is because they cover for and back corrupt officers. Time and time again. Cops who turn in other cops are fired. The number of videos showing police misconduct and thuggery is staggering. The number of police shootings that were completely unjustified is equally staggering. The vast majority of the time these cops walk. All because people like yourself thinks that because someone has a badge that they are incapable of doing wrong and should never be held accountable.

[Eric Gardner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s8JklrBSlk)

[George Floyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vksEJR9EPQ8)

These are just a few samples. People have no idea what type of cop they are going to have to deal with so a prudent individual would treat all cops as if they are corrupt.

For the record I do not support de-funding the police. I support holding them accountable when they break the same laws they are supposed to enforce. That includes manslaughter when they shoot an unarmed man in the back seven times. Just like I would be if I did the same thing, no matter what I ""thought""."
12913,ifsgr4,"As long as the training does't include training like [Dave Grossman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETf7NJOMS6Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETf7NJOMS6Y) 

Also, they are already overpaid and their pension are ridiculous. All this for 8 weeks of ""training""."
12914,ifsgr4, [https://i.redd.it/8fkrak3554j51.jpg](https://i.redd.it/8fkrak3554j51.jpg)
12915,ifsgr4,"I don't know what case you are referring to (or if this is a general principle you are espousing) but I think that having the cops shooting people at the first sign of danger rather than being able to handle situations with other methods probably increases the probability of other people getting hurt and situations like Philando Castile or Daniel Shaver where misunderstandings become someone's death very quick but if you want them to just put bullets in people's brains and be done with it, that's your opinion. Even the military has more strict rules of engagement though and they are on a battle-field. I would also think the onus would be more on the person who is literally trained to keep people safe to operate in the best and safest way possible (aka subdue the criminal with the least force necessary-and like I said lethal force was entirely justified in this video) rather than the civilian (or criminal as you call it)."
12916,ifsgr4,"Even if the arrest is unjustified, no good comes from altercating and resisting law enforcement.  I can understand the anger from an u justified arrest, but in the end do you want to go home to your family or be buried 6 feet deep?"
12917,ifsgr4,"Well in that case you should be prepared to know what‚Äôll happen if you evade arrest.  Again, I‚Äôm not justifying corrupt cops, but you have to take personal responsibility at some point."
12918,ifsgr4,Redirecting money from military equipment to training? Could help.
12919,ifsgr4,"This happened in 2018 dipshit, stop making everything political jesus christ"
12920,ifsgr4,[removed]
12921,ifsgr4,So three officers can‚Äôt stop a single man without deadly force? Yeah it seems as if they wanted an excuse
12922,ifsgr4,[removed]
12923,ifsgr4,"This is mostly complete, but we still lack context. What was he stopped for? What was being said? It‚Äôs that context that helps inform us properly.
As it is now, I can guess that the dude was a felon, didn‚Äôt want to go back to jail, so he pulled a gun to shoot. But I don‚Äôt know because there is no context.

With the Jacob Blake video - even more so. Still many other vids are very short to properly get context"

12932,ifsgr4,"Oh yeah, I agree"
12933,ifsgr4,"Chill bruh, I think he should be severely punished for that, what I thought I saw was a comment that was being super harsh for no reason, but I was wrong, that guy was beyond crazy in the clip."
12934,ifsgr4,Retired 3 years ago after 22 years and you couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to go back. Screw that job
12935,ifsgr4,It‚Äôs already being screamed everywhere. Its now to the point that some POCs think if they commit a crime they should get off scotch free.
12936,ifsgr4,It's almost like the job cops have could use a little reform to take some weight off the police.
12937,ifsgr4,Now why do you have to turn this political the very first chance you get? I've seen this video get applauded on liberal subs too. Grow up
12938,ifsgr4,"They have posted this video to fb but ONLY when the cops are fighting him, claiming what he did was in self-defense and he‚Äôs a victim. The idiots agreeing it‚Äôs self-defense are just plain stupid if they don‚Äôt ask what happened before that? But yeah, sure, it‚Äôs ‚Äúself-defense‚Äù only because of his skin color... So much for unity."
12939,ifsgr4,"Oh yeah. And so many ignorant asses are HAPPY that he shot a cop and claiming he did the right thing protecting himself? And they keep saying it was police brutality when they tackled him for violently resisting arrest. What are they supposed to do? Just throw up their hands and let him beat them and get away? The left has lost it‚Äôs mind and all about playing victim when someone does illegal crap. And it‚Äôs only for POCs. They‚Äôre so hypocritical and blatantly racist. I‚Äôm trying to not be ‚Äúthat‚Äù person but that while thug subculture is the real issue. They glorify and martyrize criminals but don‚Äôt blink an eye when black kids are killed from shootings.
They are silent about black on black killing and you‚Äôre racist if you bring it up. Why? It‚Äôs a real issue and this is why so many cops do profile black men. It‚Äôs not justified but teach your kids to be a good person and respectful. 

Start from the inside so things change for the better. That whole thug life attitude causes red flags for most people as it‚Äôs supposed to be cool to steal, fight, and have a ‚Äúf*ck you‚Äù attitude. Start fixing the problem and you‚Äôll see results, but nope, let‚Äôs just burn down business, cars and churches because that‚Äôs really going to change things. /s"

What did she do?"
12941,ifsgr4,Do you have a link of his mom coddling him? I don‚Äôt understand that mindset of defending a criminal like that. The whole ‚Äúhe ain‚Äôt done nothing to nobody‚Äù and what not. Clearly he did do something to somebody and now he‚Äôs in jail. Actions have consequences.

I don't think any social worker could have done shit to restrain my drunk out of his mind stepfather, throwing furniture through the window. 

So, keep the police fully armed, fully funded and teach people to comply with LEO's when they have committed a crime."
12944,ifsgr4,"A city in Kentucky has already hired social workers. They respond to certain calls and go in after the officer gives the all clear.

12946,ifsgr4,"1000 American total, not 1000 unarmed"
12947,ifsgr4,Sources? That 1000 seems outlandishly high. And unarmed doesn‚Äôt mean not a danger.
12948,ifsgr4,"Where are you getting the number 1,000?  According to USA Today, in 2019 there were 14 fatal shootings by police of unarmed African Americans and 25  fatal shootings of unarmed whites."
12949,ifsgr4,"Ok, well let‚Äôs say they stop reacting in a way that ensures their own safety, the number of unarmed citizens may go down yes, but the number of officers killed will rise. The question isn‚Äôt wether officers or citizens are killed more in their interactions, it‚Äôs who has priority. In this case officers could at anytime face an armed individual who would do them harm, minimizing this requires sacrificing the safety of this being detained. It‚Äôs unfortunate but it‚Äôs a reality that can‚Äôt really be fixed."
12950,ifsgr4,I'd say overall they do a fine job. There are millions of police interactions every year. Not very many are newsworthy.
12951,ifsgr4,"they don't need more funding, there needs to be oversight on how they spend their *existing* funding."
12952,ifsgr4,[deleted]
12953,ifsgr4,They don't need more funding. They need to stop overspending on used military equipment thinking that's going to better prepare them when there are morbidly obese cops who can't walk a block without being winded. The standards for police are incredibly low and they set their own bar. You can't polish a turd with tactical gear.

12955,ifsgr4,"Even 100-200 hrs of training over the course of a year in bjj is enough to get a blue belt and deal with your average untrained guy on the street like he‚Äôs a rag doll 

Source: I‚Äôm a blue belt and love the face on new guys way bigger than me who can‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm subbing them"
12956,ifsgr4,"That's very unlikely considering there's only 40,000 IBJJF certified black belts in the entire world, so probably only ~2,000 in the USA. But we could train every cop, or at least most cops on the basics of jiu jitsu. This alone would make interactions safer for both cops and suspects, and would help us avoid situations like in the video."
12957,ifsgr4,How about we make jujitsu training a required part of the job?
12958,ifsgr4,"Body triangle, seat belt position. Done and done."
12959,ifsgr4,"I'm aware they teach it....and they also teach many other ways to gain control over an opponent. Point blank, police should not be using potentially lethal techniques they have no training in using."
12960,ifsgr4,Eric garner is the classic case because the move IS illegal. You‚Äôre asking me to find cases but they‚Äôre aren‚Äôt many BECAUSE it‚Äôs illegal in most areas because of its potential lethality. But there are many cases of people suffocating to death in police custody because they‚Äôre constantly being sat on. Ex. Tony Timpa. And he wasn‚Äôt even black. Again. Why are multiple cops always sitting on top of prone detainees with handcuffs on?
12961,ifsgr4,"I want to know if he had previous convictions or a warrant. WHY would you react like this when being handcuffed for a DUI? If he‚Äôd have gone in peacefully, none of this would have happened. But nope. And now we have him and other idiots claiming he shot in ‚Äúself defense‚Äù."
12962,ifsgr4,Yup I‚Äôm from Europe and media here doesn‚Äôt portray it as police brutality like in the us since they don‚Äôt have a political agenda to be apart of. It‚Äôs quite disgusting the way they twist facts tbh
12963,ifsgr4,"Apparently everyone thinks that more training is a simple, easy answer. Nobody accounts for manpower, scheduling, trainers and most problematic, injuries. How many IOD cases is a department going to have before it scraps the BJJ program? What do you do if veterans can‚Äôt meet the training criteria? Do you fire the 45 yr old female lieutenant with 20 years experience because she can‚Äôt master a triangle choke?"
12964,ifsgr4,So you acknowledge that this a problem though?
12965,ifsgr4,Because they‚Äôll justify the guys behavior and him firing a weapon at the police. I‚Äôve seen them do it before.
12966,ifsgr4,Doesn‚Äôt go along with the narrative the lefts trying to push so you sure as hell won‚Äôt find people taking about this on any leftist sub

They seemed to use appropriate force obviously when the guy pulled a gun on them, but I‚Äôm not sure why they had him pulled over in the first place.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if your black or white you shouldn‚Äôt do that. People take one side and then refuse to see police as humans. I think we need better training and higher requirements for police. How do we do that? Increased funds not abolishing or de funding them."

12982,ifsgr4,The badge should be a higher standard not lower.

You want to reach in your car after fighting me? Expect to die. You want to try to take my gun? Expect to die. Pretty simple. Be a decent human and you will be fine. Act like a crazy person trying to kill me? Expect to die. Im not risking my death so that i can give you a forth and fifth and sixth chance to cooperate. Once again, leftists want someone to be responsible for others. Its bullshit. I am responsible for me and you are responsible for you. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Its simple.

12985,ifsgr4,"Ye right, tell me what equipment could you cut that could increase police training by a sufficient amount.. you need increased salaries if you‚Äôre gonna have better training, you also need new recruitment programs among many many more things.

Officers ostensibly take the profession voluntarily. I don't think I have ever heard of a situation where an officer felt no choice but to be an officer.

Conversely, I doubt anyone interacting with a police officer that results in someone dying does so voluntarily.

If this is the case, shouldn't the person being forced into the altercation take priority because they did not have any say in being there?"

If you have a 100 man department training 4 hrs a week in BJJ, you can guarantee 10-20% are going to get hurt.

Even more telling is how you admit it rarely happens.

13041,ifsgr4,"I mean if you want to look at the world in such stark and simplified terms then be my guest. I'm trying to explain that there are many situations where civilians get shot or otherwise killed by cops without doing any of the stuff you mentioned. This is why it is important we try to steer cops towards a better understanding of when lethal force is necessary (like in this situation) and when it isn't (like in many others). I get your whole personal responsibility thing and how you want to paint leftists but I just want as few people as possible being killed, cop and criminal alike. While you're talking about responsibility, does the cop not have the same (or more) responsibility to not do stupid or dangerous shit like fire through a window at a woman without announcing himself for no reason (Atatiana Jefferson)?

Edit: I would also like to add that I am glad you're not a cop then (I assume). I don't know if you know this but they aren't supposed to shoot people for trying to fight them. They are supposed to shoot people when it is their only resort. You know because people have constitutional rights and the right to a trial (which you can't get if you're dead) is one of them?"

13058,ifsgr4,"Obviosly not. Let me give you a little anecdote, my step mother‚Äôs uncle died in the early 2000s while working on the force. He pulled over a guy who, as far as I know had matched the description of some petty criminal, he approached the vehicle and was shot as he walked up to the window. The officers may be voluntarily be taking dangerous positions but I believe this only strengthens the prioritization of their survival. They aren‚Äôt forced to risk their lives for a below average salary, they chose to. They chose to protect the laws of and serve the people of the government. The people interacting with police may not be criminals necessarily, they may be speeding or smoking in no smoking areas, but at the same time they could very well be mentally unwell violent idiots who could harm or kill the officers."
13059,ifsgr4,"How many hours a week does a cop spend at the gym lifting or working out, at the shooting range? I think you realistically sub some out some of those hours for bjj.

I mean I have a full time job working 40+ hrs a week and manage it no problem. I also actually pay someone to teach me. If I were getting it from my job I‚Äôd love that."
13060,ifsgr4,Imagine being at a cops funeral and saying you couldn't train them because they might have gotten hurt and you needed to answer the phone. holy fuck.
13061,ifsgr4,You need 6 months of training 2-3 days a week to be a solid blue belt. A solid blue belt could probably beat up 85% of people on the streets. Muscle memory comes quicker than you think.
13062,ifsgr4,I admit that chokehold deaths rarely happen... because.. surprise. They‚Äôre banned. But plenty of people are killed by cops for being sat on. Take the L. Why did tony Tampa have to die? You‚Äôre not answering my question on why three cops always seem to sit on belly down and handcuffed detainees
13063,ifsgr4,Ye it‚Äôs quite frustrating watching cnn and such when it‚Äôs so obviously biased. When telling people here about it they hardly even believe how bad it is since they are so used to being able to trust media somewhat at least so they think that American media must also have the same journalistic integrity it used to.
13064,ifsgr4,Yeah. I highly suggest watching donut media's video about the ford police interceptor (although it is just about the ford PI) alot of the modifications made to police cars are the same.  For example they can usually take really high speed rear impacts and protect the passengers.
13065,ifsgr4,"You are right, and I have.  I also believe that bad cops should be removed, I just see a lot of lumping all police together.  Also lumping all protestors together.  There are good and bad people on both sides, and both sides should be calling out their own assholes."
13066,ifsgr4,"So ACAB doesnt mean ""All cops are bad"" and ""defund the police"" will only affect the bad cops?"

13070,ifsgr4,I said people and not you specifically as I have no idea on your stance on the matter. Hopefully more people would see it like this instead of going the anarchy way of abolishing the police completely.
13071,ifsgr4,Because of the high percentage of proud boys in this sub. You talk about no video but who knows what those cops said to that guy. I mean cops shoot a guy in the back 7 times recently. Why aren't we all outraged over murders period? Any people oppressed will eventually find balance in kind. 2020 is the year of overall market adjustment.
13072,ifsgr4,"The world IS in fact simple! When you boil it all down it is very simple. Do what is right. Be a decent human and you will not find your self in these situations. Yeah, mistakes are made and police have shot people on accident or by being overly aggressive but these are rare, extremely rare. Im tired of a few incidents defining the entire state of being. We live in a country with a population approaching 400 million. How many crimes are committed everyday? How many arrests are made everyday? How many people in Chicago alone are shot everyday? The answer; a shit ton. An absolute fucking shit ton of crime and violence and drugs across the country everyday. You people want to cry and burn down cities because a handful of people are killed by police each year? Less than 1000 total and you know what? Probably 10,000 deserved to be killed by police but the police managed not to. And by the way, more white people are killed by police than black people so fuck off with all the bullshit racism accusations. Police do a damn good job in this country and you should be thankful for them.

Its also telling that you have all the names of black people shot by police memorized when they account for less than half of the deaths. You know any names of white people killed? There are more of them so should be simple if you aren‚Äôt a racist. My guess is that you don‚Äôt. You know why? Because the media which you are so controlled by doesn‚Äôt actually care about police violence, they care are about making money when you click on their articles or watch their channel. The divide is what they seek and you have fallen for it."
13073,ifsgr4,You mean the false narratives of systemic racism and police brutality?
13074,ifsgr4,"That‚Äôs literally what the person you‚Äôre replying to is doing loooooool, since when do you execute someone for a crime they‚Äôve committed in the past? How come three officers can‚Äôt restrain a single man? Best case scenario is they‚Äôre not fit for their job, worst case scenario is they wanted an excuse to kill a man. Not sure which point you want to make"
13075,ifsgr4,"Not a straw man at all.
How are they supposed to subdue someone without using proven techniques like.....putting your knee on their kneck.....lol

You whine about deadly force, and you whine about less than lethal methods.

The point is you are going to whine unless they treat black criminals like they are Mary Poppins."

13081,ifsgr4,Wow...much respect. For admitting that...
13082,ifsgr4,"Probably. The first half of my career was really good. Back then people didn‚Äôt just blanket hate cops. Think post 9/11 I‚Äôd have kids come up to me and tell me they wanted to be cops etc. it was not so dangerous and there were far less shootings. The call load wasn‚Äôt too bad so you had time to be proactive and look for DUIs etc. that all slowly went away the last half of my career and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm out now. I have a pension and still work full time and I‚Äôm only 47 so the retirement aspect of it was great, though they‚Äôve changed that for these new guys and ruined that too."

While not common they are not rare. Again anyone that is emotionally unstable enough to commit harm to themselves is unstable enough to commit harm to others. It would be ludicrous to send unarmed social workers into a dangerous situation without any means to protect themselves."
13084,ifsgr4,Wait don‚Äôt same number of police have to show up to give all clear then city pays 2nd later of social worker to come in?
13085,ifsgr4,"Especially when the bodies of unarmed social workers start stacking up. A significant savings in the budget since they don‚Äôt pay dead people a salary. The demands for police reform and the massive deployment of social workers will result in dead social workers; then the same crowd who thinks it‚Äôs a great idea will, without a hint of irony, demand the hiring of more cops to protect the unarmed (unless you count their clip boards) social workers. These ideas are really great ‚Äî in theory. They might work on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, Catalina Island, or other small, non-violent towns, but the cities can be profoundly dangerous and unpredictable places."
13086,ifsgr4,Because look at any other homogenous predominantly white area and look at its levels of violent crime. Use the Dems go to nations of the Nordics for example.
13087,ifsgr4,"My condolences for your family's loss. Regardless of what side we argue in the matter, I think that we can agree that any loss of life in such a violent manner is a tragedy.

Regarding police officers choosing the profession and their wages: "" The national average annual wage of an police officer is $67,600, according to the¬†[BLS](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes333051.htm), a little over $15,000 more than average annual salary for all occupations, $51,960. ""

While you might argue that they don't get paid enough, on average police officers do not get paid below the average salary.

Additionally, by your own admission they chose to accept those terms. When they receive their badge, there is no way they do not understand that they put themselves in harms way. An officer goes to work knowing at some level they may be in life threatening danger. A random person they interact with, who may or may not live through an interaction with the officer, does not go about their day thinking they may face death, let alone being paid willingly to do so.

It seems to me that there is some idea of police officers doing society a favor by becoming police officers. I do not think that this is the case: they get paid relatively well to do a job, and that job should not afford them priority in who lives and who dies. At most, there should be an equal consideration for all parties in a potentially deadly scenario, which is still counter to the culture today."
13088,ifsgr4,"you can't skip shooting/lifting training lol

and hand-to-hand combat skill is not always the answer during life and death situations."
13089,ifsgr4,Most police officers have to work side jobs so they can take care of their families. Most are sleeping when at home and don‚Äôt have time to go to the gym.
13090,ifsgr4,I used to run 3 miles 3-5 times a week for cardio but that‚Äôs it.  We did get maybe 2 hours monthly in either arrest control or firearms. Not nearly enough for it to be useful. I worked for Orem PD in Utah. Retired 3 years ago after 22 years
13091,ifsgr4,"Most cops on average only go to the range to qualify Beyond that your working. When your off you are either sleeping, trying to spend a little time with your family that you get or your at inservice which if it‚Äôs on your time off is between 3 to 4 days straight detailing different new policies or methods. You don‚Äôt have time to go spend 3 hours a week doing anymore than what you barely fit into your life and I‚Äôm sorry if you want to actually feel like you have a family outside work because it gets rough real quick."
13092,ifsgr4,"really, during my taekwon do training blue belt simply means you can start fake-sparring lol"
13093,ifsgr4,"They shouldn‚Äôt be banned, because they are safer than almost any other method to restrain someone struggling. 

Take the L is referring to Garner being arrested. He said he wasn‚Äôt going to get arrested that day. It cost him his life. 

If you haven‚Äôt trained for a violent person, you wouldn‚Äôt know how that is the position it best gives you for controlling the person and with the least amount of force. 

Almost any other position requires 2 people to control them without putting them in a position that if they struggle you have to injure them to restrain them

It rarely happens, because it rarely requires you to keep the person on their stomach. Floyd had a crowd and even Thao admitted he was nervous both to the size of Floyd, but also the crowd (since there has been times crowds get involved in the struggle. 

T√≠mpa was a different issue, he called for help, he didn‚Äôt just start stuff. The minute you start something my tolerance for force used against you grows very quickly."
13094,ifsgr4,Finding unbiased news articles is so difficult in the US. Everything is twisted for whatever agenda. If they actually just gave the facts people wouldn‚Äôt be in so much of an uproar but they want us to be divided and chaotic.

13095,ifsgr4,"I think if everyone in every walk of life called out the assholes around them, the world would be a much better place"
13096,ifsgr4,"Read about what defunding the police actually means. It's easy to read those words and think ""they must hate all police and want to destroy them!"" but that's not actually what it's about.

13100,ifsgr4,Yea thats dumb for sure. Especially because alot of those people would be the first to call the police if they're in trouble.
13101,ifsgr4,"If you truly want to believe that people who do everything right are never killed then fine. I just hope you never have family killed by police. I've already mentioned a white person who was wrongly killed by police. I have no doubt that there are many more that I don't know, and that is a tragedy. If you want to call my attention to some of those cases please go ahead and I will condemn the actions of the cops in those too, as it is wrong no matter what color one's skin is. Sorry but I can't just ignore people being killed as a statistical anomaly or an inevitability, people deserve better and in a modern developed country we can do better, as many other countries do even taking into account our larger population. Even aside from that, my bigger issue is with the justice system as a whole but that would take a much longer amount of time to explain and I have a feeling I won't get anywhere.

It's always interesting when people bring up absolute number of deaths rather than proportion of population, why would that be an accurate measure?"

Ahem......cough..Bullshit. https://www.bjjee.com/videos/how-to-use-roberto-cyborgs-knee-on-neck-choke/
Alternating knee on neck to knee on belly/back and back to knee on neck is acceptable in BJJ tournaments. In real life situations I wouldn't take my knee of someone's neck once I got it there.

Lastly, none of this is a straw man argument...lol  You made a false statement and I proved that you wouldn't accept anything less than the officers letting this man walk away.

If they grabbed him and threw him to the ground and used very brutal but proven BJJ techniques .....you will whine.

If they talk nice to him until he does something stupid and gets himself shot....you will whine.

He was a multiple felon that had been arrested for hiding a gun under the very seat he was trying to get to. He got himself shot ,plain and simple."
13116,ifsgr4,I‚Äôve been trying to see if this guy had a warrant out for his arrest because why else would he resist arrest and put up such a fight? Do have a link to his previous arrests?
13117,ifsgr4,"Do you think cops are hunting innocent, unarmed people for sport? You probably do. Even if this were the case (it‚Äôs not) that doesn‚Äôt change what I said ‚Äî that there will be a lot of innocent, unarmed dead social workers under these Ill conceived plans. The two things are not mutually exclusive, are they?"
13118,ifsgr4,"How about the bodies of unarmed, non violent civilians killed by cars?

Cops serve a purpose in society, just like cars do. The number of non violent citizens killed by cops is actually extremely low. Considering that they keep things safe I see that as worth it. These deaths are mostly accidental, just like car deaths are mostly accidental. Rather than reducing the amount of cops we should just provide better training to prevent needless accidents."
13119,ifsgr4,"Was strictly showing a comparison. Homogenous societies do better with less violence. Diverse societies (in this case big cities) already struggle with violence in a broad overview. 

The use of social workers is not scalable with population like I imagine you believe. Cities will end up paying nearly as many actual officers along with the new host of social workers resulting in higher budgets needed."
13120,ifsgr4,"for these 2 pathetic shooters, maybe. but you can't just base a blanket policy on this one example. I can give you plenty of examples  where an armed officer shot and killed armed perp with no injuries. Believe me, a pistol is always better than fists in terms of killing. Don't believe me? let's have a pistol vs. fist fight, are you in?

Probably not, right? I know your argument is that while these two officers tried to hold the guy down on the ground they failed to do that. Would BJJ training have helped them? Look, if two guys can't hold one guy down, no amount of training can do the job because they simply don't have the physical strength. What they need is training on how to prevent a captured suspect from overpowering two officers. Same situation as Rayshard Brooks. Maybe BJJ training can do that, but it has to be very focused just on keeping people down.

How about some chokehold..."
13121,ifsgr4,">Jacob Blake tried to commit suicide by cop.

Horse shit. Dude was getting into his car. He didn't have a weapon. He was with his kids. He didn't do shit to deserve getting shot in the back 7 times."
13122,ifsgr4,"Yeah your reading comprehension is shit. No one is saying bjj people don‚Äôt use choke holds, they literally can subdue you with any of your limbs, if they can why can‚Äôt cops?"
13123,ifsgr4,"Better training is always good and I agree cops should get better training. However, social workers are already trained specifically for the types of situations where they would be replacing police, and it seems unnecessary to train more cops to do the same job that someone else already has.  

We've also spent decades trying to improve car safety as much as we possibly can, so we should do the same with police. Should we stop trying to make cars safer and just say ""eh, people are gonna die lets just deal with it"".  Also, if you kill someone with your car there are consequences; you might lose your driver's license or even go to jail. Same should apply if a police officer kills someone innocent.  If I ""accidentally"" killed somebody, would I get off for free just by saying sorry? Why should laws not apply to police?"
13124,ifsgr4,">The use of social workers is not scalable with population like I imagine you believe. Cities will end up paying nearly as many actual officers along with the new host of social workers resulting in higher budgets needed.

This is just speculation. My point is we haven't even tried it on a larger scale. Small scale shows promise, the next step is to try it with a larger city."
13125,ifsgr4,"Do you train? I ask bc you seem to know little about bjj. It‚Äôs whole purpose is using leverage to sub opponents much larger than you. It has very little to do with strength

Frankly I‚Äôd prefer police to try to avoid killing people. To protect and serve comes to mind.

Your point of a gun being more lethal than unarmed is a straw man argument"
13126,ifsgr4,"He was resisting arrest, ignoring cops orders to show his hands, and reaching into his car (and it doesn't matter WHY he was reaching in his car, either).

That will get you shot, no matter who you are."
13127,ifsgr4,Dude has a record of assaulting cops. Why would you even walk to your car if the cops are telling you to stop? And then he reaches into his car and he got shot. Cops are also humans and never know when someone will try to kill them.
13128,ifsgr4,"...because if they do things like put their body weight onto their knee and pin criminals to the ground by their neck....you whine endlessly about shit like ,""I can't breathe"".

Pinning someone to the ground with your knee on their neck is extremely effective, just ask George Floyd."
13129,iygrt1,"Liberal here. I have to say I agree with you and that, in my experience, no one on the left was happy or relieved about that stuff. It was all just optics by large companies. I mean, maybe some of the neoliberal folk were happy about it, but progressives found it to be either ridiculous or a distraction from the actual issues. I suppose I can't speak for everyone, but that has been my experience. 

Personally, I find it absolutely moronic and short-sighted that companies reacted in this way. A less racially-turbulent society is not one that outright censors episodes of TV shows that *aren't even racist in the first place*. Removing episodes of It's Always Sunny from streaming has got to be one of the most tone deaf and ironic things I've ever seen. To me, a show that cleverly deals with race in a way that is neither racist nor overly-preachy is a sign of a prosperous society.

13192,iygrt1,"I'll answer.  I'm answering in good faith so please keep that in mind.

The answer is they were still racists.

I can't speak on all these statues obviously but IMO the civil war statues are racist and serve no purpose but to divide.

Germany doesn't have any WWII Nazi statues celebrating generals there.  

I think the issue is that they're not a wedge issue with Trump using them to distract rather than govern.

It's easier to get people riled up about these type of issues than to make substantive policy proposals and actually govern.

A LOT of politicians are guilty of this not just Republican. 

But ask yourself a serious question.  What are Trump's policy decisions other than short term immediate ones that he reacts to in the press?

What is his health care policy for example?  There isn't one.  

These issues are just distractions.

The truth is that black folks and white folks have FAR to much in common and we shouldn't be fighting.  It's never been about race - it's always about class.

You believe that the people doing this did it for the sheer joy they got from it and not out of pure hate?

13347,ig3v3b,"You guys have this argument.  But your argument defeats itself.

The alleged incidents that prompted this backlash are police actions.

Those actions happened in Democrat-run cities where Democrats control the police departments.

So, how did this become Trump's fault?

Additionally, these Democrats are deliberately LETTING THEIR OWN CITIES BURN because they know that it really ISN'T about what THEIR police departments did in THEIR cities.

THEY KNOW that it's about rage against Trump.

We all know that because they tried to attack the White House and injured 60 Secret Service agents.

And if Trump said, ""Okay...I'm stopping all of this violence right now...""

All y'all saying, ""This is happening under Trump, though..."" would go, ""He's a dictator...look at this!""  We know you would because YOU ALREADY DID when we sent federal agents in to help Portland when Antifa was attacking the federal building there.

If the right was doing what the left did during the final months of Obama's first term in office... would you say, ""This is happening under Obama, so it's his fault""?

No... you'd be saying, ""These are goddamned domestic terrorists and it's time to do something about it."""

13481,igpnbm,Peaceful protests do not require curfews.
13482,igpnbm,"Riots and protests have different definitions, but CNN refuses to call anything a riot or violent. When private property is destroyed, museums, libraries, and businesses burnt down, people are assaulted, stores looted, shots are fired, explosions go off, cops are injured etc. that is no longer a protest. Even when there is an official statement of a riot, hacks like CNN still refer to them as protests, at that point it is clearly gaslighting people."

If you were a cop who tried to subdue a guy and he resist arest and doesn't get effected by a tazer, he goes and reaches into a car. What do you do? Do you wait for him to commit grand theft auto with hostages in the back? Do you let him grab the possible weapon and shoot you or your partner, or do you shoot the suspect until he's subdued? All this is going on in the officers heads with adrenaline pumping. 

Oh and the guy has a past of resisting arrest and drawing weapons on police, also again the charges of sexual assault. and the women called the police. 

But yeah those cops were racist, next time someone assualts you please don't call the cops"

13509,igpnbm,"I understand what you are saying towards not making it about race but did you read the text that CNN put up with the video at the top of the post? The person you called part of the problem didn‚Äôt do anything different than all major media outlets have been doing, except he clarified it was black on white crime. Race has been defining the headlines now for months, so long as the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù is a non white.

13517,igpnbm,Oh wow so do you think if it were the other way around they wouldn‚Äôt spend longer reporting on the white man murders unarmed black child in front of his family?? Im not comparing the two situations im comparing the two very different kinds of media you‚Äôre allowed to get.

13519,igpnbm,"> these cops that murder these people are still on the streets

What cops? All four cops present in the Floyd have been arrested and are being charged. (Although, based on the full body cam footage that was recently released, the charges for the other 3 cops will probably get dropped and the charges against Chauvin will probably be downgraded to manslaughter.)

Jacob Blake, the guy shot in Kenosha, isn't dead. The cops did not kill him. They shot him, non fatally, as he ignored their orders and reached into his car. No one familiar with the law will look at that video and see the use of force as being unwarranted."
13520,igpnbm,">Do you want to cover every single murder that happens every single day on national news?

There are far far more cases of blacks murdering whites than their are cases of cops justly or unjustly killing blacks. Should we stop putting these police shootings on national tv because it's not a big story either?"
13521,igpnbm,"> man went to prison

Wrong, this case just happened a couple weeks ago. He‚Äôs in jail. Trial hasn‚Äôt occurred, no verdict, no sentencing. 

> he is now in prison and denied bail

Wrong again. Those in prison have already been convicted, therefore they wouldn‚Äôt have a chance at bail. Sessoms is in jail and held without bond ‚Äî why? Because there was already a statewide manhunt for him, which gives credibility that he‚Äôs a flight risk. 

> Justice was served

Once again, wrong. The case hasn‚Äôt gone to trial yet. 

> i don‚Äôt understand why so many right wingers are upset that this kid isn‚Äôt getting national attention

Of course you wouldn‚Äôt understand! After all you‚Äôre the party of late-term abortions, supporting BLM who are against the nuclear family, and supporting Obama who put kids in cages and did countless drone strikes overseas killing hundreds of kids. 

Stay awake in civics class next time."
13522,igpnbm,"Now who‚Äôs comparing apples to oranges? In those situations we knew the entire story. We still don‚Äôt know the entire story with george floyd, and people continue to speculate with that situation too. If it were the other way around you know damn well there‚Äôd be nationwide protests, and they‚Äôd be calling for all white people to be defunded. The fact is people are so worried about being outraged for blck people that they don‚Äôt give a shit about these kids that are dying. They won‚Äôt really even talk about black on black crime. The thing everyone is thinking is why the fuck doesn‚Äôt it get the coverage that this bullshit gets? Why aren‚Äôt people just as outraged? The answer is because people don‚Äôt care, the media doesn‚Äôt care, and it‚Äôs because its not part of the narrative."

13535,igpnbm,"The difference between the two is that one is serving justice while the other hardly gets justice. This is why the protests were happening. Most of those black on white murders that you‚Äôre talking about result in the black man going to jail. People get upset when cops murder a suspect instead of having them serve jail time. Cops are not jury judge and executioner, they are there to see that justice is served, not to serve the justice. When a cop murders someone and steps out of line they are hardly held accountable in many cases that we have seen in recent years."

13545,igpnbm,He was also trying to break up a fight with kids in the car apparently .... not good parenting
13546,igpnbm,"In most cases of a cop killing someone instead of arresting them, the use of force is warranted. The cops primarily want to make an arrest. They aren't out on the street just looking to kill people.

George Floyd was a tragic mistake. He fought the cops the entire walk to the squad car and the entire time they were attempting to get him into the back of the squad car. The entire time the cops were 100% nice and accommodating. Floyd had continually expressed concerns about not being able to breathe prior to being forced to the ground, which was his entire excuse for not wanting to be forced into the squad car. George Floyd went to the ground by his own request, yet fought the cops the entire time going to the ground.

Does this warrant him dying? No. The cops had the situation under control pretty much the entire time. Chauvin made a mistake by holding him in the manner he chose for such an extended period of time. Now, Chauvin, has been arrested on 2nd degree murder charges. Personally, I believe those will be downgraded to 3rd degree murder (manslaughter). But, justice is being served.


In the Jacob Blake situation, the cops wrestled Jacob Blake to the ground. Blake fought the cops and managed to get up and walk away. He ignored cop orders and began to reach into his car. He forced the cops to fire. The cops did not know what he was reaching for so, they had to assume it was a weapon (we still don't know the full details about what he was reaching for). If the cops did not fire, and it was a weapon he was reaching for then instead of looking at a possibly paralyzed thug, we would be looking at a dead thug, possibly a couple dead or injured cops, and possibly dead or injured innocent bystanders. The cops did what the job required them to do to insure the safety of themselves and everyone around them."

Their platform literally has nothing about abortion limits and since NY and VA have passed late term laws they are for it. 

Here is the video saying anyone can get an abortion for any reason. 


https://youtu.be/t0kC1B__CJ4

Late term abortions are often not for medical reasons. It is a lie and even the pro-abortion Guttmacher admits it. 

> ‚Äú[D]ata suggest that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.‚Äù

> five general profiles of women who sought later abortions, describing 80% of the sample.‚Äù These women were ‚Äúraising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous [had never given birth].‚Äù

Of course even if that is true, the cops would have subdued everyone involved while they asked questions and got the full picture of what was going on.

We do not know if the cops were aware at the time but, Blake had a warrant for his arrest. Sexual assault, trespassing, and disorderly conduct. Likely why Blake resisted arrest.

According to eye witnesses, prior to the cops firing, they had wrestled him to the ground, punched him, and tazed him all in efforts to subdue him. Additionally, prior to firing, one cop yelled for Blake to ""drop the knife"" although, it is still unclear whether Blake actually had a knife at the time."

Top one is protesting police brutality. Regardless of whether you agree with it or not that‚Äôs what they believe. ‚ÄúOur lives are at stake and it should be understood that some people will get out of hand.‚Äù

The second picture is people protesting (if I remember correctly) safety measure against COVID. Which NBC would argue is a stupid to protest over. Regardless if you agree or not that‚Äôs what they believe.

Same way if you don‚Äôt think police brutality is an issue (or at least a big issue) you would see the top picture as dumb because you have fundamental differences with the cause."

All the media has, to the point that has become like something out of a creepy totalitarian dystopia. And NBC did characterize the rally outside of the President's hospital as a circus.

You're going well out of your way to focus on the picture, rather than the media's actions."

13627,j4tvdx,"Can you explain what you think the discrepancy is between someone holding a ""coronavirus is a hoax"" sign and the President being in hospital with coronavirus?

People who claim that the virus is a hoax are not saying that it doesn't exist. They are saying that the reaction to it is disproportionate. Even Trump's claim was that the virus had been politicised - not that it didn't exist.

Both things can be true - the virus can be blown out of proportion and Trump can still be in hospital with it - the two things aren't mutually exclusive."

My cousin had a boyfriend that was a drug dealer. I convinced her out of the relationship because she was making a bad choice and she might get in a situation. The drug dealer had a child with her.

Any gun law is an infringement of the bill of rights. The language is clear. 
I take it by your spelling of 'defense' that you're a Brit. You guys are throwing people in jail for telling mean jokes now; we don't want whatever it is you're offering."
13702,j4tvdx,"Unfortunately the police cannot protect you, they can deter criminals with their presence, and they can catch a criminal AFTER the crime has already been committed. The police currently cannot do either of those with the mobs of people running around without consequence, that leaves very few other options but to be prepared to defend yourself."
13703,j4tvdx,"1. The police obviously weren‚Äôt there because he was being attacked without any police protection. 

2. There is no reason he should not cross into Wisconsin to where he worked as a lifeguard to help out cleaning up, helping a friend protect his business, try to put out fires started by rioters, and provide medical aid to anyone who asked.

3. He was not carrying a weapon illegally. Even the antifa crotch sniffer of a DA had to accept that fact since Kyle was not charged with illegal possession of a weapon.

That you back the rioters and looters who destroyed businesses in Kenosha over the legitimate self-defense of this young man indicates that you are seriously unhinged. His not guilty judgement will not be a surprise to anyone more sentient that Biden."
13704,j4tvdx,What made you want to spend your life defending pedophiles?
13705,j4tvdx,"I should add that the police are under no obligation to defend anyone not in custody.The SCOTUS has decided this multiple times. For example, in 2001 the Seattle police were ordered to stand down and watch while rioting gangbangers murdered Kris Kimes. Kimes made the mistake of trying to protect a woman the bangers were sexually assaulting in public. The police just stood there watching.

Think of this the next time you advise someone to depend upon police for protection."

This was not a ‚Äúdrug shootout.‚Äù This was a breaking and entering. 

Plus let me know why the cops received a grand jury and walked didn‚Äôt. This kind of determination as to whether the police accounted themselves should be made by a jury.

Breonna was unarmed and the cops shot aimlessly. Why is ok for the police to kill people?"

13727,j4tvdx,It‚Äôs disgusting isn‚Äôt it?
13728,j4tvdx,That kid shouldn't have been there in the first place. The guy who raped 5 kids should have been tried and sentenced to prison time. It's not that hard

13731,j4tvdx,The three he shot lived and equidistant if not further away than he did. So that's not a valid argument because they shouldn't of been there either then.
13732,j4tvdx,"I disagree with literally everything you've said and apparently stand for except for this comment right here. But I must point out to you, in an effort to extend the olive branch of coming together (and relating to your earlier point about the kid trying to do the job of the police):

Kyle shouldn't have been there, but he's still innocent. The fact that he felt compelled to be out there is an overt failure of local leadership to take control of the situation, which is a Democrat problem.

The rapist should have been in prison, but there's no punishment for criminals in Democrat cities; yet another democrat problem. 

So next time you want to like or retweet someone saying ""anyone who votes for trump is a racist and there's no way around it"", remember that there's people who are voting for the safety of all men and women, no matter their color. And by saying such a thing, you're impeding their free speech, the free speech of all men and women of all colors. 

Think of that next time you want to talk about alternate realities. You think you stand for equality and decent causes, I think your reasoning behind that is fundamentally flawed and misguided, but I do respect that your heart is in the right place, but you're hurting people and the country perhaps unintentionally."

It was stupid of him to think he could make a difference without more help, but the fact remains that he had every right to be there, albeit not with that weapon. As far as we know, the the first attacker attacked him for putting out a burning dumpster they were planning to use as a weapon. If it turns out he initiated the violence, then I'd agree with you. But as it stands it seems like he was attacked without reason by a group of pretty vicious people, a clear cut case of self defense.

I said he should be in prison. Re read my comment. This time slowly.

13840,hzh5i0,"(Functionality new redditor, what does /s mean?)"
13841,hzh5i0,The point being made is the hippocratic stance that people can go protest but cant go to church or all the other places off limit due to covid.
13842,hzh5i0,Saying it contributes to the spread of covid.
13843,hzh5i0,"100% love protests (actually peaceful ones, not the riots now) but it is the hypocrisy of saying for people to go and protest but you will get a fine or get arrested for trying to reopen your business."

13845,hzh5i0,"6cm distance is enough, right guys? Six is six."
13846,hzh5i0,Just hypocritical as it is stated inconsistently that it does not spread covid.
13847,hzh5i0,I agree. A true Republican would be protesting with them.
13848,hzh5i0,"Police brutality IS an issue that needs to be fixed, but the majority (not necessarily all) of conservatives are not going to try and solve the problem by protesting, especially not by rioting. Just because we aren‚Äôt out protesting peacefully (or rioting and destroying property) doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt care about the issue. It means we don‚Äôt agree with the methods being used because they aren‚Äôt doing anything productive. Peaceful protests have their place, and are important in some cases, but I think everyone knows what‚Äôs going on, and continuing to protest and riot and burn down cities doesn‚Äôt help the cause. There are better ways to solve problems, and ways to do them without risking health by ignoring cdc guidelines and being hypocritical"
13849,hzh5i0,"So people all up in each other's faces, with their sweaty ass balls is sanitary?"
13850,hzh5i0,Then why are beaches closed for Covid?
13851,hzh5i0,"Well, that is technically true it just doesn‚Äôt apply to a situation like this where they are literally shoulder to shoulder"
13852,hzh5i0,Fact: more people have died as a result of these riots than all unarmed black men shot last year.
13853,hzh5i0,I'll just tell them that I didn't want to catch COVID and that I didn't want to burn down a city.
13854,hzh5i0,STFU
13855,hzh5i0,A) Nobody aimed assault rifles B) The laws were followed exactly C) They didn‚Äôt riot and burn shit down. D) Protest and riot are two different things. Quit trying to confound them.

13866,hzh5i0,"Of course this can contribute to the spread, but is protesting in the name of civil rights deserving of disrespect because bars and churches are closed?

13873,hzh5i0,Dunno why you‚Äôre only counting last year. This is a generational issue. No leftist I know is focused ONLY on police violence against POC. And since there is no comprehensive data of people who died in police custody on a national level. Police brutality is a plague on our country that we don‚Äôt even know the full extent of.

13887,hzh5i0,"I respect their right to free speech and freedom to peaceably assemble. What everyone is saying, which is so hard for you to understand for some reason is WHY can these folks express their constitutional rights but not exercise their freedom of religion? Ik exactly what you're going to say ""you don't need to go to church to express your freedoms"", you don't need to violate every CDC guideline and protest outside either, just do it online, if you want to go that route.

13890,hzh5i0,"Leftists made this about George Floyd, I don‚Äôt see why conservatives have to as well. As of today, it‚Äôs common knowledge what Floyd did in his past. Both you and I know exactly all the things he did, but Derek didn‚Äôt know any of that when he stood on his neck for several minutes. Derek, being the cop with 18 previous complaints and is currently facing 9 felony tax charges by the way, did not know what we know about George. He was a cop that had an oath he swore that he broke alongside the law and procedure he was trained for by murdering him. 

If you genuinely think all police officers should be able to act as judge, jury, and executioner then you believe in a police state and I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm actually genuinely curious about this, like do you politically disagree with the 6th and 8th Amendment? I prefer the entirety of the constitution but I guess some people like yourself can pick and choose what they like. If you weren‚Äôt aware, 6th Amendment assures you the right to a speedy and public trial and the 8th Amendment assures every single American citizen that regardless of what crime you commit, your punishment will not be cruel or unusual. So if you believe the police have the right to perform cruel and unusual punishments on individuals such as kneeling on one‚Äôs neck for several minutes until death and that those individuals do not deserve trial, your political opinion is unconstitutional and not American. Like, it‚Äôs just that simple. If every cop can act the way Derek did, two constitutional Amendments would be ignored. I‚Äôve fought against the leftists for trying to take away the 2nd Amendment. If it turns out that some of the right are trying to take away the 6th and 8th Amendment then I‚Äôll fight that too."
13891,hzh5i0,No the left is saying protest do not spread covid.
13892,hzh5i0,"Not necessarily all of them are, but most will vote for who they think is solving the problem. Trump himself is making efforts to create a database for police misconduct to make it much more difficult for officers to cover up and hide from things they‚Äôve done wrong. He is also encouraging officers to work closer with social workers and mental health professionals, as well as creating new guidelines for training including sees elating tense situations safely and when the proper times to use force are. Trump is doing a lot that people don‚Äôt see, and that many republicans vote for him to support the issues he‚Äôs fixing instead of protesting."
13893,hzh5i0,"Sure, forget about bars but what about churches, should people not be allowed to worship?"
13894,hzh5i0,"Yes, on the west coast beaches are mostly closed. Think about all of the people screaming and yelling at protests. Bet you anything Portland is going to have a huge increase in cases."
13895,hzh5i0,"Ummmm what? Literally more people have died in a matter of a couple months than an entire year of ""the problem"". If the cure is worse than the illness, why go for the cure? 

Police brutality isn't nearly the issue you dream it to be."
13896,hzh5i0,The left take advantage of the black vote. They Left has always been and will continue to be racist.

13900,hzh5i0,All it takes is one person who‚Äôs A-symptomatic to turn London into more of a dumpster fire
13901,hzh5i0,Trump didn‚Äôt decide to do the shutdowns. I think that would be your governor...
13902,hzh5i0,Why is corona tied to the US election?
13903,hzh5i0,"You can, it‚Äôs just less likely in open air"
13904,hzh5i0,"I understand your argument, and I truly feel for you and your mother in that awful situation. I don't believe you understand however, how these things (praying, drinking, protesting) are different in practice. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but by your logic, if just one person is restricted from going to a house of worship, or visiting a hospital, because of COVID shutdowns, then no one should be able to do anything outside of their homes at \*all\* until everything is allowed to open again? Or do you just mean \*specifically\* no protests because it's a crowd? Which would therefore also extend to beaches, parks, and essentially all outdoor group activities, etc.

As for CDC guidelines, there's plenty of folks in this photo wearing masks who clearly know don't want to spread, but obviously not all of them, because masks are somehow a political issue now, and no matter where you go there is no 100% usage.

Lastly, for the record, the end goal of exercising your right to practice religion is to do just that, praying without restriction. You can do that alone (not in a crowd), in a church or not, and still feel like you were able to do it. Protesting requires a different approach, such as making so much noise and taking up so much space that your message is heard. ""Do it online"" is like telling someone who wants to go to a concert to just look up the lyrics and read them because it's the same thing, which it is not."
13905,hzh5i0,"Wrong. 

Protesting is not illegal. Look it up. It's a constitutional right.

In this photo I see people holding signs and chanting. No guns, no armor, no camouflage."
13906,hzh5i0,"Floyd is the typical piece of shit police are forced to deal with. He was the typical piece of shit that victimized innocent people. He was the typical piece of shit that gets killed resisting arrest.

Police don't kill nearly as many of these animals as they should be. Far too often, police back down, ""diffuse"", or give latitude to aggressive and mouthy criminals when they interact with police. Think about this for a minute; if a criminal animal gets hostile and aggressive with the armed police officer, exactly what do you think happens when an average unarmed civilian stands up to their criminal behavior?

Lack of killing these animals when appropriate, is why they are rampaging like a pack of apes now.

As for ""complaints"" against police; I find them to be bullshit. If the complaints had merit; the cop would have been removed from duty."
13907,hzh5i0,"If they‚Äôre wearing masks and not shaking hands with everyone, they should be allowed. There‚Äôs also virtual church options for crowded/high covid number areas. 

A packed megachurch in Florida (where we‚Äôre seeing 100+ deaths per day) is very different than a church in rural pennsylvania."
13908,hzh5i0,"I already said the protests could potentially spread covid and I agree beaches should be open. I know that in my city, Philadelphia, there was weeks of protests and no spike in covid."
13909,hzh5i0,Right. Like it was the left who ceceeded from the union over slavery.
13910,hzh5i0,your point?
13911,hzh5i0,"As a southerner, I do love a good ‚Äúbless your heart.‚Äù The British ain‚Äôt got nothing on that ;)"
13912,hzh5i0,"Y‚Äôall, this is what happens, all.around.the.world, when you don‚Äôt have concerts or sporting events. People are crazy, and they need an outlet. And these young people are the stupidest, craziest generation yet. Cannot wait for history to decide..and have all the pictures to prove."
13913,hzh5i0,"To them, we are the dumpster fire ;)"
13914,hzh5i0,Trumps incompetence caused your country to have the worst handling of the pandemic in the world - that is the reason for no pubs.
13915,hzh5i0,"My issue is that these folks violate multiple CDC guidelines, some might wear a mask but they're also right on top of each other. I'm just wanting people to follow these guidelines since the start so we wouldn't be in this shit. These crowds are bigger than 50 or 10 people (I forget which is the exact number the CDC recommends right now). I'm not for beaches being opened, tanning is not a constitutional right. Sure, there are good folks who are trying to maintain their distance and wear masks but even if HALF of the protestors are doing the opposite, we're back to square one. I'm mostly looking at Oregon since it's the most recent example here.

As I previously stated, I am FOR peacefully protesting, I'm simply calling out the double standards some folks (not you specifically) have when it comes to this. Freedom of religion is freedom to practice it, not just prayer. You can wear a hijab or a cross. You can go to your places of worship if you'd like. You can't just be for the protesters but against the religious freedom in these trying times and vice versa.

I think a better example for your concert point was to look up the performance live; doing what some musicians did and they do their performances on IG live. A few did it, I forgot specifically which ones, maybe Selena Gomez.

To give some info on the situation with mom, it pisses me off how some people aren't 6 feet from each other, don't wear masks and have some sweaty ass armpits all on each other and I'm not legally allowed to be with her. Like, I'll get tested again, take a temperature test and be only next to my mom, I don't care, I'll do it but I'm not allowed to because of COVID. Do you see my point?"
13916,hzh5i0,"I never ever said protesting is illegal. I said yelling fire in a crowded theater is illegal. These ""protests"" during this pandemic are the equivalent of yelling fire in a crowded theater. Gee what caused the second wave of corona? Hmm........"
13917,hzh5i0,"I get what you are saying, and yes I agree that criminals should not be treated well, but like I also believe in the general idea of prison and such forth. But there is no law saying that resisting arrest is a crime that execution fits as punishment. If you think that all police should be allowed to break protocol more often in order to kill those resisting arrest, you essentially believe in a police reform. Well, I don‚Äôt and I think the police are fine as they as now, but they need a set of rules to follow. The constitution tells us serial killers, rapists, murders, terrorists, and every other citizen of America is guaranteed rights with the condition and I don‚Äôt see why cops should be the only people in America that are allowed to ignore parts of the constitution because they want to in the moment. It‚Äôs as simple as this: if this cop is allowed to kill people like that you simply believe in a harsher police state while I do not. It‚Äôs not that the police did a bad thing so he should be punished, it‚Äôs that the police officer knowingly broke the law and his own oath to the police. I don‚Äôt think the police rules need to change, but if you want a massive police reform allowing them to hunt down criminals and step on their necks then vote vote vote until you can get that candidate who‚Äôs ready to do that but until then it may be hard to find others to support your noble yet radical cause."
13918,hzh5i0,"Fair enough, so going by your logic shouldn't these protestors be doing the same thing though? In this very picture and various others, they are not following CDC guidelines and are within inches of one another."
13919,hzh5i0,I feel like the media is refusing to report cases tied to protests...
13920,hzh5i0,"I mean, by association, if you're comparing it to something illegal, you're pretty much saying how you think they \*should\* be illegal, but I'm not going to argue semantics.

Second wave? I wasn't aware we got past the first one. What date did that happen? Why don't we go ask Florida, or Texas, or Arizona, or Georgia, where cases have skyrocketed? Don't ask places like Portland, or New York City, or DC, where huge protests have taken place yet cases have not jumped nearly as high. Red states have their hands full now, is that where all the protesters live??"
13921,hzh5i0,"1) Actually, there is a law that says resisting is a crime; furthermore, there is another law that says resisting with violence can become a death sentence as police POLICY, PROTOCOL, AND PROCEDURE says that officers are allowed to use any force necessary to protect their safety in a violent altercation. Police are never required to back-down; as that is known to put police into further jeopardy.

2) Police rules say they don't stop anyone without ""probable cause to believe crime is afoot"". Police rules further require that police must ""reasonably believe a crime was committed by a person"" prior to arresting said person.

3) It is a perversion of the facts to believe those being killed by police, don't deserve everything they are getting. It is a perversion to blame police for the deaths, and not the criminals who have first committed a crime, and second used violence against a police officer in attempting to resist the pending arrest.

Bottom line; the narrative that police are bad; and criminals are good; is just asinine. It is people with long and violent criminal histories being killed by police who have a history of defending our nation's citizens from these raging animals. Black men aren't getting killed because police hate black people; black people are getting killed because they represent the lion's share of criminals. Skin color does not make someone a criminal, and it doesn't excuse criminal behavior.

And here is an after-thought to those who are black reading this; aren't you outraged that your whole race is being characterized by these animals? They represent only a smell fraction of black people, yet the entire nation seems bent on claiming you are all criminals at risk of death by police."
13922,hzh5i0,"I think if they protest without a mask they‚Äôre an idiot. When I saw protests go by while living in philly I‚Äôd say at least 95% or more wore them and we never had a covid spike. Also churches have an older crowd who are more at risk while most protesters are young, but they could totally still bring it home to at risk family members. In those cases they are assholes if they don‚Äôt stay home."
13923,hzh5i0,"Doctors/hospitals/testing centers report data, not the media. I‚Äôm sure the media would ignore spikes related to the protest if they did happen but the data doesn‚Äôt lie."
13924,hzh5i0,"I mean if you're spreading a virus you're no longer protesting. You're engaging in bio terrorism. Also things were calming down and numbers were getting better. Then the protests happened and after two weeks we saw a drastic increase in numbers. 

In summary, i've now determined that you too, are a terrorist."
13925,hzh5i0,"So, the procedure is they are allowed to protect themselves their safety, I get that. But there were 3 other officers just standing around him while he was being knelt on. If Derek Chauvin‚Äôs life was in genuine danger and the man needed to be killed immediately for the safety of the officer, wouldn‚Äôt 3 trained police officers be able to do something about it? Floyd had no guns, no weapons, he never threw a punch, there was never a moment where 4 trained officers all felt immediate danger by some guy crying on the ground. 

You have to remember, in most situations like this the cop feels like he is in danger so he fires his gun to put the threat down. But, Floyd wasn‚Äôt just shot and killed in a chaotic moment of danger where the cop had no other choice, it was just 8 minutes of him sitting on the ground, with 3 other officers standing around him just watching, and at one point all 4 were on him. 

If 4 trained officers can not handle an unarmed man resisting arrest and over the course of 8 minutes feel like the only way for all 4 of them to make it home that night alive was to stand on him and watch, then god the liberals are ENTIRELY wrong. They want to defund the police, but that‚Äôs not going to solve anything. They should keep the budget, hell they should even raise funds, if it means they start putting more of that money into training for our officers. I‚Äôd feel safer in the streets knowing that just one cop could save my life from an unarmed thief safely without much hassle or paperwork, but that‚Äôs not the America I live in. In our America it takes 4 officers to stand on a man for 8 minutes and call it a day when he dies. Liberals are calling for police reform to weaken the police, but at this point we oughta reform it just to make it more stronger and competent."
13926,hzh5i0,"You seem to be pretty well-informed and good natured. I just find the hypocrisy with a lot of protesters in say Oregon who are standing 2 inches from each other and some without masks. Even with the masks, it's still recommended to keep 6 feet apart, folks in this picture are not. Then again churches can adopt some sort of safety measure. I'm not a religious person but I do respect that right."
13927,hzh5i0,"Perhaps, but don‚Äôt you think it can be manipulated? It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense for it to spread in one scenario but not the other, with almost identical variables (number of people in crowd, amount of time exposed, not social distancing or wearing masks). I just don‚Äôt buy it."
13928,hzh5i0,"The kneeling was a control procedure and did NOT lead to his death. 

You may not have seen him resisting arrest; but that is because you haven't seen the footage from between when he was brought around for the show-up and when he ended up on the ground. 

4 trained officers DID handle the unarmed man; what you may be forgetting about are the other three suspects that were also being watched.

Bottom line, the guy was a multiple loser who had a seriously violent past, was strung out on meth, was caught being part of a counter-fitting ring, and knew he would be spending over a decade in prison this time. 

Police are trained to assert dominance; and by doing so, avoid the majority of confrontations. When police back down or are seen as passive by criminals; they are likely to be challenged, which is where lives get put at risk. There will be less deaths, when criminals again begin to fear police responding with a higher level of violence.

Keep in mind if you will please; this higher level of dominance and violence I am suggesting; is in police dealing with criminals. Police are able to distinguish between criminals and innocent people, and their judgement on when to use or not use force should be based on their situational awareness, not on fear of politically motivated retribution or ridiculous policies made by those who don't wear the uniform."
13929,hzh5i0,"I appreciate that, you as well. I think we are pretty much on the same page with how we see protests related to covid and the safety measures needed for churches to open."
13930,hzh5i0,"No. Different protests/events/states are different, there is an element of luck/chance of whether infected people show up to something or not. Data isn‚Äôt going to be consistent everywhere you have to look at overall trends. The amount of people who would have to keep the secret of manipulated covid data makes it nearly impossible for there to be no whistleblower."
13931,hzh5i0,"It didn‚Äôt lead to his death? So, then how did he die? The autopsy ruled that his death was caused by mechanical asphyxia from compression on his neck and back by the kneeling. And then a second medical examiner had a look and said it was cardiopulmonary arrest caused directly by the police. So, what‚Äôs the alternative, how else could he have died? 

And, I‚Äôll admit that when I watch the video, I‚Äôm watching as a citizen. I‚Äôm not a police officer, I‚Äôve never been detained or arrested, and I‚Äôve never been in a situation like that with the police. But, there are police officers who have watched that video and know that they would never act that way in that situation and the cops they serve alongside wouldn‚Äôt either. The act of kneeling on someone‚Äôs neck to control them is not a procedure that the police follow. In the state where it happened, there are only two legal ways a police officer can put someone in a chokehold: the officer either does it light enough to simply control him using his arms or legs or hard enough for them to lose consciousness but not die. Officers of the law are not trained to kneel on the neck of someone with handcuffs on, there‚Äôs just no point because it is dangerous and could potentially kill them and the role of police officers isn‚Äôt to kill criminals it‚Äôs to arrest them for the court of law to deal with them from there."

The worker read his question in a clear and measured tone from his phone. Joe then proceeded to insult and point in his face.

14046,il02t6,Nazis literally committed genocide guys
14047,il02t6,Just as dumb as I would expect from this sub
14048,il02t6,It's smart that they had the police agitator dress up as antifa like they do in real life
14049,il02t6,I really don't get this aren't they using free speech on blm protests
14050,il02t6,i think both sides compare far too many things to fascism/nazism. it‚Äôs dumb and imo indirectly trivializing of the atrocities committed by the nazis....
14051,il02t6,Why can‚Äôt we just find out who their parents are and tell them to cut the credit cards.
14052,il02t6,Funny thing is: neither of them support the jews.
14053,il02t6,holy shit thats boomer as fuck
14054,il02t6,"Democrats these days are scarily similar to the Nazi's; They try to beak up America into smaller and smaller groups therefore making us easier to conquer, deliberately persecute certain groups, they attempt to erase/change our nation's history via destruction and forcefully teaching the youth youth *their* version of history, promising outlandish welfare programs and change for the country, using violent mobs to create a climate of fear around the country to try and supress opposing voters...

14071,il02t6,"Before the nazis controlled over the german government they were like what Antifa is today. They killed people (on a smaller scale, yes but murder is murder)  if we let Antifa take power they will create a regime simmer to the nazi regime. You may say ""they can't do that"" or ""they won't do that"" but that's what they said when the nazis took power and because nobody took them seriously millions suffered from the consequences."

14073,il02t6,It‚Äôs in relation to free speech & how they operate in tackling these ‚Äúissues‚Äù
14074,il02t6,"Well, one is a political movement fueled by hatred and racism and the other one is a political movement fueled by hatred and racism. Also, they are similar in the fact that fascism is an interpretation of socialism. Before inventing fascism Mussolini was a socialist and even after he left socialism he kept his socialist ideas and transferred them over to fascism. Just an example the fascist party was not called that, rather it was called the national socialist party. The name alone explains the difference between fascism and socialism, the idea of fascism is to unite ethnic groups (wither peacefully or by force) but still keep national identity. Socialism (or more specifically marxism which is the interpretation of socialism that BLM and Antifa follow) is the idea that the entire world needs to be united under one national identity and system. Other than that they both believe in seizing the means of production and are both racist and antisemitic."
14075,il02t6,How are they not the same?
14076,il02t6,Because it‚Äôs comparable.
14077,il02t6,You are very ignorant.
14078,il02t6,wow all you have to do is rename them to the national socialist party and the two images will become the same image.
14079,il02t6,Also both democrat supported organizations.
14080,il02t6,That is exactly what Antifa and BLM are.  But if you are a patriot you are racists. It is so ass backwards and it kills me how my own fellow citizens are falling for this shit and supporting it! They are burning homes in the middle of the night with sleeping people in them. How is that going to prove whatever idea they are trying to get across? The idea I think is .....if you are white you area a target. One leader even announced OPEN SEASON on WHITES! How the hell are they still walking free. Let a white American or whomever say this about a race we be jailed for a hate crime. What they are committing are textbook HATE CRIMES.

14083,il02t6,"First, Antifa and BLM are Marxist and second fascism is an interpretation of socialism. Also, the image does not imply that nazis and Antifa are the same instead it implies that Antifa is the modern-day equivalent of nazisim ."
14084,il02t6,Actually the Nazi party started as a socialist movement and they were a rag tag bunch of idiots before they were nazi germany....so these images are more alike then you give them credit.

That's false - they were wearing uniforms that clearly said ""police.""

14118,il02t6,dude you gotta relax.
14119,il02t6,So it‚Äôs.... an imperfect analogy?
14120,il02t6,Antifa isn't a political party. It isn't even an actual organization. A group has to have form and structure before it can actually accomplish anything. Antifa is a fad whose participants just want to put on masks and fuck shit up for fun.
14121,il02t6,What about the dudes who kill protestors? Do thry not remind you of nazis?

14124,il02t6,Nazi even means National Socialist.

14129,il02t6,"Trying to fix problems in America is patriotism, blind adoration for a country is nationalism. 

If you teach history in the way the US has where we are always the winners and if we fight for something we will be victorious OF COURSE that's how people are going to act. The USA started/founded because we didn't like the way the British treated us - we revolted/rioted/ruined all sorts of property and wrote out a list of demands.. It is in the blood of American citizens to do this lol you shouldn't be surprised. I'm not saying any that burning shit down or looting is good in anyway. Some of the things going on is down right deplorable.  

But if they are THAT unhappy, there is something going on. This behavior is coming from somewhere. It's like a child acting out. What is the most constructive way to get them to stop? Listen to them, look at what's going on at home? Someone in their life might be abusing them."

14135,il02t6,How are they suppressing free speech if they don't have any control over anything other than their own individual actions?

They are violent and have secretly injured many people and have killed some. The nazi party have shared these exact same views. This is not a comparison of what most people think of the nazi party: genocide and racism. Although antifa members have voiced out against white people(even the white members do this, how stupid). This is saying that nazis have shared the same behaviors of being violent against anyone that doesn‚Äôt share their views. Which is in all honesty true. Hopefully this makes sense to you know."

14164,il02t6,"you are totally right, I feel there is no right side to be on. I will not argue police does need reform. Not a question there, but we do not need to defund the police.

Probably sounds awfully familiar in terms of party. But however that was the rise and similar tactics of Antifa. The censorship comes in by obviously the propaganda minister Joseph goebbels. Nothing harmful against the state was readily available, and if someone managed to get some of that info the secret police were sent to kill/arrest depending on what they felt like what that day. The burning of books about religion, history, historical plays were all thrown in. Except the pro German state books(this era as well as previous era formation, Kaiser, Weimar etc). The similarities are there, but obviously not on scale of big tech or China beciase of modern technology. The roots of mass censorship in the modern era originated with Nazi regime."

Hell I can't even put them in the back of my marked ambulance while wearing my uniform if they explicitly tell me they don't wanna go. Even if they're dying. 

But that's the medical side. Cops have to place you under arrest and give you your Miranda rights at the very least. Also, I wouldn't trust a medic that doesn't want me to know his/her name.

I believe if in some past instances if those particular officers were better able to evaluate the situation and recognize signs of mental illness or distress that the outcome could have been less tragic.  My police in my city are great and like you said 99% of them do a great job. Being an officer is not a JOB or career like some protestors are claiming. Bullshit, once a cop always a cop. It is a life just like a military man. 

I truly wish I knew the solution to today's issues. I am just an average citizen but I wish we all had the same agenda and pushed in a peaceful way to get the change we need. These riots are solving anything other the it is hurting innocent civilians and doing nothing to achieve their goals. This makes me think this is what they want. They want to destruct and hurt people, not cops, but people period. There are messages of Antifa pretty much declaring war on civilians. The law is letting a convicted felon who assualted and attempted to murder that young man in Kenosha. He was caught on video with the gun in his hand attempting to shoot the kid in the head. He is free with no charges but Kyle is being charged with 2 counts of murder in a text book self defense.

Take away free speech so thinking any way other Then how THEY think would be a crime. Like China and the KGB Russia, the dissenters would just ""disappear""

These AntiFA and BLM rioters would be the new KGB.  In other words the ""new Police"". They will police with their fist (like their logo). People think the police are bad now, wait until the new Police take over. Communism at it's finest!

14259,il02t6,"Because context is important. For me, when dissecting the ideas within an ideology, it's important to put expectations on certain agents. Muhammad claims to be a prophet from the God of Abraham, right? Ok, then let's compare his actions towards those prophets in the old testament and put him against the actions of Jesus Christ and his apostles of the New testament. 

When looking at their expressions of being a human, including both goods and faults we possess, I can sympathize to them. Books of Psalms and Ecclesiastes talk about self criticism and their unworthiness to God, even tho these kings of Israel (David and Solomon) were chosen prophets of God. They are ashamed for whatever they did that was contrary to God and his law and for centuries Jews and Christians learn how to live towards their God, namely to be humble and fearful of God.

Then you've got the story of Muhammad. A husband to a much older, rich woman named Ghadija who inherited her wealth, spend the next 10 years trying to evangelize those in Medina that he is a prophet. And after he couldn't prove that (he's the only ""abrahamic"" prophet that never performed a miracle), he started to befriend groups like the Jews, Christians and pagans (Sabians are spoken very positively in the Qur'an, despite the fact they were Arab pagans, whereas monotheistic Zoroastrians were persecuted harshly by Muslims) to which he afterwards started to copy their ideas of ""conservation and peace"". Afterwards his life consists of continues jihad, forcing people to convert, pay jizya (only an option for Jews and Christians) or die. 

And the ""they both believe in Jesus"" facade is not even true. Christians believe he's the incarnate God, namely the Son of God, the Son of Man as he was prophesized about in the book of Daniel. They believe he forgave sins, brought people back to life, was put to death on the cross, resurrected after 3 days, spend 40 days after and sent the holy spirit after 10 more days. 

Muslims say ""Isa"" was a Messiah, but let's look at that in their context: Isa did indeed heal people, but he didn't forgive sins since only God can do that. Also, he didn't died on the cross in their version. Supposedly he taught people the message of Allah, but since the New testament today is nothing like the Qur'an, it meant that Isa failed, and hence we got Muhammad. There's lots of problems here: Isa was not the Arabic name of Jesus, it's Yesu, what Arab Christians call him to this day. Further if he didn't come to proclaim and confirm the prophesies, whichever were from ""Muslims"" before Islam, then how can you call such a failure like Isa a Messiah? And there's many eye witnesses from independent sources that Jesus died on the cross and live after his death. 

I could write a lot more, but I'll admit I'm not a subject expert nor do I hold any degrees to help you in depth to understanding Islam. The point, which I hope came across, was to show the different prophets and messages they provided and prophesized about (although Muhammad prophesized nothing, which doesn't help his claim to prophet) and how different also the characteristics of their version of God is.

I recommend you watch videos from Arabian Prophet. He's a Christian Arab who's one of the most knowledgeable people on the Qur'an and its context. He's also written multiple books available on Amazon."

14277,g4szkc,"It's certainly possible to believe all three, but that doesn't really change the fact that we need to maintain our social distancing policies for a while longer.

It's fair to be concerned about the state of the economy, but it will get better once the crisis has passed and we can all go outside and start buying things again. Dead people can't participate in commerce, so we're better off in the long run by focusing on minimizing infection rates.

It's fair to be concerned about authoritarian power grabs, but millions of Americans could die if we're not careful about this, as opposed to the tens of thousands who already have. We shouldn't be looking at this as the government taking freedoms away from us, we should be looking at it as Americans working together against a common enemy.

People have been throwing around ideas like opening up the country ""slowly,"" but that doesn't really mean anything. It's not a balancing act between the economy and human lives. We either lose some people and harm the economy, or we lose even more people and inflict greater harm to the economy. That's our choice.

If an organization of doctors, nurses, and health experts with medical degrees were leading the charge for opening the country, then I would think it's the right time, but it's not. The charge for opening the country is being led by geriatrics, tacticool militias, and sovereign citizens with Facebook pages. They're not the ones we should be listening to right now."

However some states such as California and Nevada are taking this out of proportion. We cannot be confined to our homes that long and simply watch the economy fall. I believe we should all have the choice to quarantine or not. Millions of people are now unemployed and suffering from poverty. However I also believe that those that are high risk such as my grandparents (70) (78) or other people over the age of 50 or those with underlying conditions. We all need to face the virus and gain herd immunity. To conclude far too many people are suffering from poverty and unemployment to continue this mandatory lockdown any longer. But as I said I feel all high risk people such as those with underlying conditions should continue their quarantine. 

Post scripture
Very few or no healthy people under the age of 50 with no underlying conditions have died from this virus. There are viruses that are far more deadly that we‚Äôre not quarantining for such as TB.

14317,g4szkc,"Problem is I don‚Äôt think even a tiered opening of the economy is the solution. People have already lost a TON of jobs, and those jobs aren‚Äôt going to be coming back any time soon. When that many people have no purchasing power, larger companies make cuts, more lay offs, decreased production. The opening the economy plot isn‚Äôt going to happen the way everyone thinks it will. 

I propose mortgage payments and loan payments should be moved to the back end of loans (instead of piled up for a 1 time payment 4 months from now). I also believe UBI should be implemented (mainly because workers who are self employed contractors don‚Äôt qualify for unemployment) until the month that the vaccine is given. A job stimulus will be needed to boost the economy and give these contractors (many of which were Lyft/Uber drivers) another opportunity at employment - because while people are financially struggling those jobs won‚Äôt generate enough revenue. Unemployment will remain as it always has for the remainder. 

At least those are my thoughts, and I support closure until a vaccine is available. Mainly because our hospital infrastructure won‚Äôt be able to handle COVID and other diseases/medical emergencies. This would lead to fatalities 10-fold for all treatable illnesses simply due to a lack of space, doctors, nurses, and time. This fear will impact the economy negatively anyway, so we have to address the fear before we can resume normalcy.

That being said I think the reason for social distancing is getting lost. We are social distancing so that hospitals do not get overrun, this would lead to unnecessary deaths. We are not social distancing to completely end the spread of the disease as this is not possible. According to most medical epidemiologists we need about 30-40% of the population to contract it, creating a herd immunity. At that time we should have a vaccine where we can administer it to the high risk people, another 20-30% that have not contracted it. Then we let the population intermingle again and the remaining people contract it, 30-50%, in the low risk category. 

We can and will save lives."
14323,g4szkc,"Businesses are in the process of making millions of test kits right now. The federal government is actively working on the supply chain as we speak. The supply chain works as follows, hospitals/testing locations report to the State Health Department their need for supplies. The Health department works in conjunction with the Federal supply to procure said supplies. Right now supplies are very low as we just started ramping up production a couple weeks ago. 

Also every state is different and require different responses. Think of it like Europe. You would not expect every country in Europe to follow one set of pandemic rules as the countries vary too much in everything from infection levels to access to medical care etc. etc. Each state in the USA is like it's own country and needs to be treated as such. 

The Federal government is the coach they call out the plays and provide the necessary supplies and information. The States are the players that need to execute the plays. Sometime there is a need for the coach to send in a ringer, army or national guard, when they see their team losing."

14343,g4szkc,"That's not true at all. These lockdowns do quite a few important functions. First they help flatten the curve, which means that people are getting infected at slower rates, which lessens the stress on our already stressed healthcare system. The lockdown also protect the people who are most at risk, the elderly. This virus is not the flu, and it's incredibly dangerous. You need to understand that. If an 80 year old get this virus, they'll have a very hard time recovering. Even if they do recover, this virus lowers the lung capacity. We already have 780,000 positive cases, and over 40,000 deaths. There are entire families that have been wiped out by this virus. To put it in perspective, the virus death toll already surpassed the number of American deaths in the war in Afghanistan. The total American death toll in the Vietnam war was 58,318, this virus is going to eclipse this number in a week or two. This virus is going to kill more in 4 months than these wars did in 20 years. The white house projections show the death rate being as high as 200,000 cases, and this is with the lockdown in place. Can you imagine how disastrous those numbers would be without it? Herd immunity is not an option. The thing is we have the means to minimize these numbers, so aren't we? Why should all these people die because some brain damaged morons can't comprehend and respect the scale of the situation? We're in a middle of a global pandemic, and it's only getting worse. America in particular is nowhere near even seeing the peak. An economy can recover, dead people can't. Don't be stupid, sit in your house and let's wait until this thing slows down."

This is false. Economic downturns in America actually lead to [LOWER mortality rates](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-depression-had-little-effect-on-death-rates-46713514/). The worst economic downturn in the country's history, the great depression, is no exception."

14364,g4szkc,"There are three sides to the experience that I‚Äôve seen that most of the population fits into. 

A large percent of people live in highly developed and dense urban population centers. These people feel the virus and are probably close to someone who has had it. They are supportive of the lockdown and want it to last as long as necessary. 

Some people live in rural areas of states that don‚Äôt really have huge metro areas. These states are mostly starting to ease lockdown. Many of the residents are fearful that this will bring the virus to their areas, or believe the whole thing is overblown. Most likely, they have not known anyone with the virus yet. 

The rest live in states that do have huge urban areas, but don‚Äôt live in these areas. These states continue extending the lockdown with no end in sight. And yet, these people probably don‚Äôt know anyone that has the virus and it isn‚Äôt very prevalent in the town they live. These people are still feeling all the pain of the full extended lockdowns that the big cities need, even though it might not be necessary where they live.

14366,g4szkc,"Yes! I have heard about that, but much of the economy relies on large cities, and many major employers like Amazon and Walmart (which are essential) are having outbreaks already.

It‚Äôs person to person contact, and the R0 (transmissibility) is hypothesized to be exceptionally high.

Fear and uncertainty will keep people from eating out and shopping/spending, so a tiered opening won‚Äôt be a realistic solution anyway. That‚Äôs the crux of why we may HAVE to wait for a vaccine - to address these fears that depress economic growth, which we know has a domino affect.

Our emergency care will be stretched so thin that even freak accidents like car wrecks won‚Äôt get timely attention. People will die, and not just from COVID. 

I understand the economy is tanking, but it won‚Äôt be any better if people are fearing for their lives on a daily basis. The market is ruled by fear and expectation. I found a video in this reddit thread that presented a good alternative to help people with the cost of living and loan payments: https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/g5dhix/dude_goes_off_on_the_government_about_stimulus/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

He discusses a mandate for putting loan payments and mortgages on the back end of the loans. Obviously reasonable. Also, we do need a better unemployment system AND a UBI stipend temporarily until a vaccine is available. The UBI should be terminated as soon as a vaccine becomes available (contractors and Lyft/Uber etc can get back to work). The unemployment can remain in effect as it normally is, and of course, we expect the market to be bad for a long time after this anyway so even then the Lyft and Uber drivers will be having a hard time. Hopefully we can see a job creation stimulus to address that.

Edit; when I say a ‚Äòbetter unemployment system‚Äô I mean these cock suckers need to fix this overburdened and broken technology so they can address the millions of people who need it

Edit 2: if you‚Äôre wondering who will pay for the UBI and economic stimulus (debt will be large, yes) since the fed is controlling the printing, an investment in the economy via stimulus/UBI (to keep spending up) will boost the economy and make the US DOLLAR$ stronger, which will generate profit and pay for itself.

This is completely false. The original 2 million death figure came from a study by Imperial College of London, and the study didn't take into account many factors such as having a lockdown in place. The white house made projections that had a range of [100,000 to 240,000](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/490490-white-house-models-show-100000-240000-deaths-due-to-coronavirus-even), and they're much more accurate. We are heading towards a figure in that range by the end of the summer. However, if strict guidelines are imposed we could avoid such a catastrophic figure.

> There is absolutely no way that lockdowns and social distancing can  statistically account for such a decrease in the amount of  deaths........its just not going to happen.

> We should still be seei hundreds of thousands dead if that 2 million number was ever possible to happen. But we are not. 

Do you know why we haven't? It's because most states have a full lockdown in place. However, despite that we're still on trajectory heading towards there. Without these guidelines and precautions, the infection rate and the death rate would both skyrocket.

> The FACTS are that this virus, is proving No more deadly that any of our previous multitude of pandemics. 

Let me put thins in perspective for you. Throughout the entire history of the United States, there have been only 3 other pandemics that were worse than this virus. These viruses are HIV/AIDS (600,000 deaths), the Asian Flu (130,000 deaths), and the Spanish Flu (200,000 deaths) ([source](https://www.infoplease.com/math-science/health/diseases/major-us-epidemics#timeline)). The HIV/AIDS figure is from 1981-2007, that means if we were divide that number by the number of years (26), we would get roughly 23,000 deaths annually. We can go ahead and say that on really bad years, that number could be as high as 30,000. However that is still lower than 42,500 cases that the coronavirus has taken in the past 3 months. That means in the entire history of the country there has been only two pandemics that were worse. This is one of the most deadly viruses we have ever seen. On the path we're headed, the coronavirus might actually surpass the Asian Flu. 

Since that's hard to comprehend, let me put it this way. The coronavirus killed more than 10x times as many Americans as the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq combined. The Vietnam war is estimated to have killed around 58,000 Americans. The coronavirus is killing around 1700 Americans a day. That means the virus will surpass the amount of deaths from the Vietnam war in 10 days. This virus will kill as many Americans in 3 months as a horrific war that lasted 20 years.

>I will admit that social distancing has had some impact. But no where  near as dramatic of an impact as liberals would have you think. We need  to get back to work yesterday...... 

No, this isn't a partisan thing. This isn't even a political thing. Social distancing works. We've seen it work in Germany, we've seen it work in South Korea, we've seen it work in Taiwan. And we're getting data that it worked in Italy and Spain as well. Social distancing works. The lockdowns work. This is not a normal time, and this is not a normal virus. We're nowhere near ready to open up the economy again. I am just as concerned as everyone about the economy, but opening it prematurely will just lead to more chaos. A few months of a lockdown is a very small price to pay."

14388,g4szkc,That‚Äôs as calculated by confirmed cases. Many studies show the antibody rate to be at least a factor of 10 and could be 25 or more than the infected rate. There‚Äôs a chance 30% of people have already had it and 28/30 have been asymptomatic.
14389,g4szkc,You are correct with the current recovery rate. And we will see what it looks like after the first year. But I think it will be lower than 1% in the end.
14390,g4szkc,"Greed and money, unfortunately."
14391,g4szkc,"Ah got it. Thanks for admitting you were just making up numbers. 

Like I said, **by state** the highest death rate is 7.71% in Michigan. And this is with numbers being counted as such: any **potential** deaths from COVID are counted as ""COVID deaths"" from people who weren't tested.

However, this is against only **confirmed** cases. Logically, if **every** COVID-19 patient or potential patient died right now, this would result in 150% death rates or something ridiculous. 

So, logically, the numbers are likely even lower than the percentages being given out. 

Illinois has a death rate of 4.25%. Needless to say, this has to be a pretty small county if that 15% death rate didn't **significantly** bump Illinois up the totem pole. It's only in the top 20 right now. A 15% death rate in any county of significance should have rocketed Illinois past Michigan. 

So unless you're in a rural county with something like 100 cases and 15 deaths (likely, in which case you're choosing the scarier number on purpose to fearmonger), then I'm going to say this is a lie.

https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map Go ahead, point it out. Even some of the darkest areas don't exceed a death rate of 10%, unless you're, again,  talking about one of those areas with like 200 cases and 30 deaths, which is really disingenuous when you look at state-wide, national, global percentages."

14393,g4szkc,"I get that, but these small business are dependent on public trust and people having spending money. Many Americans were living pay check to pay check before the shut down, and they still had enough to attend those business... but not now. Like I mentioned, many jobs won‚Äôt be coming back, so many people won‚Äôt have spending money, so small business won‚Äôt have a client base to return to even upon opening. And if they do, people will be cautious and less likely to spend their money on non-necessities - and we‚Äôre already keeping the necessities open. I don‚Äôt think everyone will get the virus if we do tiered opening, but I don‚Äôt think a tiered opening will work while major components of the economy have to remain closed, and while people remain jobless, and mostly while people are still AFRAID. The vaccine isn‚Äôt to get rid of the virus, really, it‚Äôs to eliminate the fear in people.

These are the problems. That‚Äôs why I presented my previous solutions. We need a sweeping approach to start from the roots like fertilizer, and that‚Äôs UBI AND a stimulus. 

Also tax payers won‚Äôt necessarily owe the US for the stimulus. The fed prints the money, and then injects it. It‚Äôs like stocks, as the economy recovers and grows, the power of the dollar goes up and the debt experiences negative inflation. It‚Äôs like investing in stocks. You put in money now and it grows as the stock grows. There was a very well worded post I saw on this earlier I can show you if you‚Äôre interested. Anyway, it‚Äôs a misconception that tax payers will experience the burden of the stimulus debt.

Edit: Did I skirt over your comment about small business being unable to weather the storm? In what ways? Like they won‚Äôt be able to afford the rent of the property? What‚Äôs preventing them from opening up after vaccine production?

My concern is that opening prematurely will require them to proceed with the normal expenditures of running a business but without the client base available to sustain it. In that way they‚Äôll end up in the red instead of stagnated."

14403,g4szkc,"This is a very long post, I apologize. I went back and gathered the components of my previous discussions. The consensus of these prior discussions are that there are some intriguing ideas, but that the solutions I presented are ones that were disagreed upon by others. Either way, here they are: 

This is a very complex problem and my response appears extreme, but I‚Äôve based it in some rationale. My major issue is that I don‚Äôt think even a tiered opening of the economy is the solution. People have already lost a TON of jobs, and those jobs aren‚Äôt going to be coming back any time soon. When that many people have no purchasing power, larger companies make cuts, more lay offs, decreased production. The opening the economy plot isn‚Äôt going to happen the way everyone thinks it will, first of all.

I propose mortgage payments and loan payments should be moved to the back end of loans (instead of piled up for a 1 time payment 4 months from now). I also believe UBI should be implemented (mainly because workers who are self employed contractors don‚Äôt qualify for unemployment) until the month that the vaccine is given. A job stimulus will be needed to boost the economy and give these contractors (many of which were Lyft/Uber drivers) another opportunity at employment - because while people are financially struggling those jobs won‚Äôt generate enough revenue. Unemployment will remain as it always has for the remainder of those who were laid off and are receiving aid.

At least those are my thoughts. I support closure until a vaccine/treatment is available. Our hospital infrastructure won‚Äôt be able to handle COVID and in ADDITION to other diseases/medical emergencies. This would lead to fatalities 10-fold for OTHER treatable illnesses as well simply due to a lack of space, doctors, nurses, and time. This FEAR will impact the economy negatively anyway, so we have to address the fear. A vaccine or treatment would do so.

I have other reasons aside from the hospital infrastructure/capacity. So, small business are dependent on public trust and people having spending money. Many Americans were living pay check to pay check before the shut down, but still had enough to attend those business. That‚Äôs not the case now. Like I mentioned, many jobs won‚Äôt be coming back, so many people won‚Äôt have spending money, so small business won‚Äôt have a client base to return to even upon opening - ESPECIALLY a tiered one (since a portion of the client base will still be jobless and unable to support local business). Furthermore, opening prematurely will require small businesses to proceed with the normal expenditures of running a business, but without the client base available to sustain it. In that way they‚Äôll end up in the red instead of stagnated. Plus, people will be cautious and less likely to spend their money on non-necessities - and we‚Äôre already keeping the necessities open at this point anyway. No, I don‚Äôt think everyone will get the virus if we do tiered opening, but I don‚Äôt think a tiered opening will work while major components of the economy have to remain closed, and while people remain jobless, and mostly while people are still AFRAID.

We have a vaccine for the common cold. The only ones who were affected were the people who refused to vaccinate. Anyone who was vaccinated wasn't affected. So life could continue as normal for most people, and there is a means to protect yourself from the flu. However, that's not the case with this virus. We have no vaccine. We have nothing. We barely even understand it. We're taking the most basic steps which is trying to slow the spread of the virus by limiting movement. The coronavirus killed 5,000 people in March, it killed 33,000 so far in April. That's exponential growth. It's going to surpass the flu next month. That's horrific.

This is your just your ignorance shining. YOU don't understand how this virus works or how it's handled. YOU get your information from worldmeters. Scientists are studying this virus is structured, how it spreads, it's origin, it's ability to mutate, it's durability, it's symptoms, which people are at highest risk, which ways can be taken to prevent it's spread, and how can develop an effective vaccine. We're getting new information every single day. There's a wonderful thing in capitalism, called specialization. It's when people specialize in certain parts of the economy and have more knowledge and experience in a particular field than most people. Medical experts are those specialists. It's beyond arrogant to think that you posses the same amount of knowledge as people who are studying it, you and I, know nothing compared to them. You skimming worldmeters everyday doesn't make you an expert. It's also wiser to listen to them than to ignore them.

>While you're worshipping at the feet of experts, they've revised their numbers from 2 million down to 60 thousand.  

Yeah, I'm going to need a source on that.

>I'm not inclined to watch everyone lose their job, savings and retirement over. 

Nobody wants to see that. This is where the government needs to do one of its few job functions, protect the American people during a crises. The republican party controls most of the government, we can use our power to keep Americans secure until it's safe to open up the economy again, without allowing democrats to go rogue and make the government even bigger.

>You're afraid of a Boogeyman and claiming it's science. It's not my problem that you're too scared. 

You have NOTHING. I'm still waiting for you to actually to bring up something of substance. You boogeyman or fear mongering doesn't change the reality of the situation. Your ignorance doesn't override what's actually happening."
14434,g4szkc,">Perhaps you should go to the politics sub or some other liberal safe space? 

It is not I who wants a safe space, but you. You want me to leave because you can't handle someone breaking the echos of the echo chamber. 

>This is a Republican sub, where not everyone has been brainwashed to  believe everything that the so called ""experts"" say............... 

You're right this is a Republican sub, not a conspiracy theory sub. What gives you any sort of authority or credibility on anything? In other words, who the hell are you to discredit experts? These are people who spent their entire lives studying and researching the field. Anyone with a brain would be more inclined to listen to someone who knows the subject than any politician or political group. 

>There are plenty of facts out there, and  the numbers just are not  supporting what some are saying about the nessessity of these lock down  measures........I dont need the media to look at what's out there and  make up my own mind. 

Let's hear them. Where are your facts? Where are your numbers? Lay them out. You saying that facts exist doesn't actually make them exist and you scapegoating the media still doesn't discredit anything. So go ahead, make a case."
14435,g4szkc,"Then you're a criminal. That's all there is to it. You're disrespecting the law of the land, you're disrespecting our law enforcement, you're disrespecting this country, and you're violating the lives and safety of others, and for what? Nothing. You just want to be a partisan hack at all costs, even if it means putting others at work. Truly criminal."
14436,g4szkc,">I'm not going to read your dissertations, if you cant say something in a paragraph or to not many people will read to the end 

How can you possibly even attempt to speak with any sort of authority, when you can't even read? Like seriously, if you're that willing to dismiss facts because they make you uncomfortable, then you know nothing about the situation.

>the point at the beginning was that even with a vaccine, up too 80000  people die each year from the flu. We have no vaccine or cure of any  kind for the common cold. We can treat the symptoms though. 

That's the thing. The common flu manages to have a 0.5% mortality rate, yet it still has 80,000 deaths, and that's with the vaccine in place. The coronavirus has a mortality rate of around 5%, that's an entire magnitude larger. Oh, and there's no vaccine for it.

> I'm looking at the same numbers you are and it's just not adding up to  be nearly as big a deal as you are making it out to be.........we dont  blink at the flu deaths, we shouldn't be overly worried about this virus  either. 

We're clearly not looking at the same numbers, or you're looking at the wrong ones. This virus killed 33,000 Americans in the past 20 days. That's 28,000 more deaths than the 5,000 deaths in march. At this rate, we're going to surpass the deaths by flu next month. And that's just 3 months out the year.

> Notice I said overly worried.......I believe it is serious, but not  enough for the justification of such draconian measures that are in  place. 

Do you even hear yourself? What draconian measures? We're literally doing the most basic thing. We're telling people don't go out to slow down the spread of the virus, and if you have to go out, protect yourself. These aren't draconian measures, this is just basic common sense."
14437,g4szkc,"People don't die this fast and by the amounts we're seeing. This is not a normal time. This isn't a typical day where people die. This is called a severe outbreak for a reason. Liberals have nothing to do with this. Can you stop thinking about this politically for a minute. Look at from a different perspective. You're in a country that has a dangerous and deadly virus spreading around. Do you keep the country open, and let the virus run loose claiming potentially hundreds of thousands of lives or do you take the necessary steps to keep under control and keep the death toll in the tens of thousands? The answer is very obvious."
14438,g4szkc,"Except the poster I responded to said 5%, surely you could have read the entire thread?"
14439,g4szkc,"> 2nd your assumption that everyone leaving the house to only buy food and clothing is way over exaggerated. Unless people really need to eat lumber, 55‚Äù Vizio TVs, and clearance Easter toys then you‚Äôre probably right. 

Such a tone deaf statement. You realize millions are unemployed right now, right? This isn't just a game of watching Netflix for many people.

>  I‚Äôm saying from what I can see and based on the news in my local economy (I‚Äôd love to see you try to argue about this without knowing where specifically I live) our curve isn‚Äôt even close to flattening and nobody is taking this seriously enough

In other words, I've given you all the numbers in the world and your argument is ""BUT I FEEL"". 

I get it, you like this sense of control and moral superiority of saying ""You peasants and your pesky 'freedom'. Don't you understand that I'm smarter than you?"""
14440,g4szkc,"You‚Äôre welcome! And after all I did find the comment I was referring to as eloquently worded: 

People gotta stop thinking of government debt as if it was normal household debt. The USA is a currency issuer and so it is literally always able to service its debt so long as there's political will to do so.

The US government can also borrow money at a ridiculously cheap rate. At present the yield of US treasury bonds is far lower than inflation. In that situation even if you don't pay back any of the debt, the value of debt is shrinking in real terms as the economy grows (which is one of the benefits of inflation). Borrowed money does need to be paid back, but money created by the Fed doesn't.

Basically, a modern way of looking at this is that government spending is a way of injecting money into the economy. Taxation is a way of extracting money from the economy. You can either balance this short term by using public debt, or balance it long-term by issuing money and using taxation to extract it later if needed. A government doesn't necessarily need to go into debt to spend.

14444,inxa19,"Hello, ""BUTFOX"" guests.  Yes.  We understand that you are **very angry** that this woman did not put Fox on this sign.

I'd like to THANK YOU for acknowledging that Fox is, in fact, a part of the media.

Usually if I *cite* Fox in response to something, I get numerous responses saying, ""Not FAUX NOOZE!""

I wonder how you live with the cognitive dissonance of simultaneously insisting that Fox IS on the level of CBS or ABC or USA Today while ALSO insisting that it cannot be trusted and should never be cited.

Mostly, I think you miss the point.  But many of you are very young.  You do not remember a time before partisan, divisive media.  You don't remember how media used to be... where your nightly news cast would report the major things that had happened across the nation and even around the world and would not curate content to be the thing that was most likely to ""rile you up"" and get you mad at one political party or the other.

Those of us who watch Fox watch it AWARE that it is going to give us news that we do not see other places... (because the major news embarrassingly avoids covering many stories these days) and Fox will give Republicans a fair shake in reporting.

You need to ask yourselves WHY Fox became so popular.  It's what... about 30 years old?  WHY do so many people watch it?  It's because the ""regular"" media became very partisan.  When an ALTERNATIVE popped up, people said, ""Okay...it's about time.""

And you also have to ask yourselves why you are so fixated and negative about Fox News, but you do not CARE that CNN or MSNBC are so biased...at least, not until someone posts a picture of a sign that calls them out.

The sad truth is that we really have no totally trustworthy and unbiased news sources in the USA anymore.  You have to watch them all in order to try to come to an understanding about what's happening.

So, don't get mad at Fox.  Because when you do this ... it's completely transparent.  You've been BASHING Fox since they went on the air and all they did was present an alternative to people.  The denizens of leftist subreddits actually want Fox SHUT DOWN because, ""My pappy was brainwashed by Fox and now he's constantly screaming about minorities and commies!""

If Fox could brainwash your Pappy...what makes you think that your constant diet of MSNBC, CNN, The Root, Salon, New York Times and Wapo hasn't brainwashed you?

Republicans can be hypocritical and full of shit about how they go about it but but legit conservatives want the best for the black community while the left seems to only give a shit about the black community when they can use them for their own gain or as a political pawn. I‚Äôd argue Trumps enthusiasm towards lowering black unemployment is a good thing because that enables the black community to create their own wealth get involved in the economy and on a path towards personal wealth and future economic prosperity opposed to the left who would continue keeping blacks dependent on government, in cyclical poverty, and manipulate them into thinking a different approach to their failed policies in the black community over the last half century is racist..."

The end goal is not for one race to be above the other, but for all lives to matter equally. We want all lives to matter the same, no special treatments. Black lives and other minorities have been treated unjustly. This is a common fact. Denying it is just silly. We want to eliminate racial privilege entirely. I hope this is something we can all agree on.

When people say ‚Äúall lives matter,‚Äù it undermines the fact that whites are generally privileged. Think of it this way: you and your family are eating dinner together. Everyone gets a serving of the meal except you. You say, ‚ÄúI should get my fair share.‚Äù Your dad corrects you and says, ‚ÄúEveryone should get their fair share.‚Äù He is correct.

Unfortunately the media works to maintain the power structure and that is to divide Americans however they can and keep everything a left right issue and now a black white issue opposed to a America vs the corrupt issue... Biden has been an establishment hack his whole career and will do nothing but throw a bone to the progressives while pushing the same establishment policies over the last 50 years. At least Trump is a bull in a china shop and is attempting to take America back from those policies. He‚Äôs not the best messenger and can be divisive especially when constantly being gaslighted by the media but his policies are 100% better foreign and domestic then what we had.

I would utterly oppose a communist revolution. That's not what left looks like to reasonable folks. I'm Canadian and left to me is what Canada currently has. Capitalism with some help from the gov in the form of health care, education, child care, etc. I consider communism to be extremism, similar to anarchy. It's not a serious option because it would require a revolution and people dying most likely. We can work within the current system to make changes that everyone can live with. I think the MODERATE left and right need to recognize that we represent almost the entire pie. We have valid concerns and arguments and can discus them civilly just like in this thread. As others have mentioned here, there's a lot of propping up of extreme examples that goes on in the media, the left being all communists for example. I think that kinda talk sells papers, and it galvanizes voters into us-and-them thinking which is easy to control. I think the lot of us are being fleeced for the sake of our voting power, and at the cost of blinding us to each others worth. Reasonable folk are the norm on both sides, but they're selling us the opposite for a lot of shitty reasons. Threads like this make that clear."

And if this keeps happening every four years, then perhaps its time (its well past time) to change the way things are done in this country. Rebuild the police from the ground up, end qualified immunity, etc.

I speak with plenty of people daily, but personally have never come across a POC who DIDN'T support BLM. Not saying you're lying, just going by my own experiences with folks. I honestly am curious what POC who don't support it have to say."

Granted colonists had no representation, and I think the tea party was warranted. I can‚Äôt help but see similarities. 

I absolutely love this country, but the government is steady grabbing power, giving itself immunity, and incarcerating ppl at a staggering rate so for profit companies traded on the stock market can prosper.

I agree that robbing and looting are not the way forward, but how would you distinguish between opportunistic ass holes and actual protestors? 

Also when years of protest result in no action but a month of protests that are ‚Äúviolent‚Äù result in immediate change, it kind of seems like the government is teaching people that‚Äôs how to get things done. I‚Äôm just not sure what other option Americans have than to protest and sometimes cause a fuss. In the face of looming corporatism, blatant disregard for people‚Äôs freedoms in favor of large corporations, mass incarceration, and immunity for those that are supposed to serve and protect. 

True republican ideas favor less big government (besides the military) and this seems like a power grab, and way for the government to punish all those involved I. Protests even those behaving non violently. Can‚Äôt say I think this is even close to a good idea. This is the greatest country in the world, the way forward isn‚Äôt 100% clear. This ain‚Äôt it though."
14917,ifh4n9,Welcome to 2020 when we had to legislate common sense.
14918,ifh4n9,Nice.  Now if we start sending corrupt cops to jail  that disrupt constitutional rights of peaceful protesters we are set!

14920,ifh4n9,I can get behind this!
14921,ifh4n9,Need a clear distinction between rioters/looters and protesters. Fining protesters directly contradicts the constitution.

14932,ifh4n9,Proud of my state finally cracking down
14933,ifh4n9,"Being a Tennessean, this is great news."
14934,ifh4n9,Didn't Tennessee also try enacting a law that said if they are protesting in the middle of a street or highway a citizen is exempted if they run them over?  I also remember reading about increased punishments for¬†protesters who¬†obstruct¬†public highways and streets.  Not sure if it went through.
14935,ifh4n9,That's what I'm talking about. Now if we can just get rid of the commies that are in control the other states and cities.
14936,ifh4n9,"It's hard to prove which rioter is responsible for which damage.  That makes restitution difficult to enforce.  

But fines are much easier, so long as the court cant just waive it because the snowflake said sorry."

14939,ifh4n9,"This is unconstitutional. Every American has the right to assemble and the right to free speech.

This is fascist."
14940,ifh4n9,Good
14941,ifh4n9,"So just out of curiosity, if you‚Äôre peacefully protesting but then the guy to your right starts looting, are you guilty because you‚Äôre in the same group? How would you prove you‚Äôre not rioting? Does this bill outline what the line is?

I‚Äôm not trying to play devils advocate or be a douche, I‚Äôm genuinely curious and wanna know if anyone has an answer."
14942,ifh4n9,noticed that too.  agreed
14943,ifh4n9,Preach!
14944,ifh4n9,"Well if blm doesn‚Äôt speak up anytime one of their ""protesters"" does something wrong then they‚Äôre showing that they‚Äôre okay with it, especially when they bail them out of jail"

14948,ifh4n9,"And you want the government deciding which is which?

Because this is absolutely going to be used politically.

If it can be used on people who are exercising their first ammendment rights, because someone (a bunch of frightened cops for example) can claim they were rioting, it can be used on anyone.

The next time you're out protesting that you shouldn't have to wear masks while carrying your rifles, you could also be accused under this law.  You probably won't be in Tennessee, but who the fuck knows right? All it takes is some scared shitless cop and it's class c felony charges and an automatic hold and a violation of your rights."
14949,ifh4n9,Democrats and complacent republicans. Takes a long ass time for shit to get done these days.
14950,ifh4n9,Was about to say the same .  Legislative sausage making machine .  Only took half the country burning down .
14951,ifh4n9,I was going to ask this myself.
14952,ifh4n9,Knoxville sub the same.
14953,ifh4n9,"Well.they can use their constitutional rights and try and vote him out....and fail...again

Remember this day people, Bill Lee stood strong."
14954,ifh4n9,"I had the same reaction. I looked up the bill and here is the section that I BELIEVE point two is referencing: 

(11) Under present law, the offense of obstruction of a highway or other public way is generally a Class C misdemeanor. The offense is enhanced to a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of $200 if, at the time of the violation, the person obstructs an emergency vehicle from accessing the highway or street, or highway's or street's right-of-way. This bill increases the penalty for the offense of obstruction of a highway or other public way to a Class A misdemeanor in all circumstances;

What that means is it‚Äôs not banning protesting but you can‚Äôt be blocking highways and sidewalks without permits. So it effectively means that simply being at an Non-permitted protest is now punishable by that fine. I‚Äôm torn, because I don‚Äôt like the idea of being at the governments mercy for a permit to protest THEM but these clowns are blocking roadways and surrounding vehicles like this is what you get."
14955,ifh4n9,"Yeah, I‚Äôd like to know more about that.. being able To protest peacefully, in my mind is a God given right and my right as a free American.  Everything else is solid to me..."
14956,ifh4n9,That fine is probably meant for protestors blocking roads and shit
14957,ifh4n9,"Yea, I have a problem with that too. I don‚Äôt care what you are protesting even if I hate it but as long it is a peaceable protest then I‚Äôm all good. You are either with the constitution or you are not."
14958,ifh4n9,"This is all well and good until there is something that I would want to protest about, then it‚Äôd be bullshit."
14959,ifh4n9,Why‚Äôs that a problem?
14960,ifh4n9,How is this racist?
14961,ifh4n9,Peaceably.
14962,ifh4n9,"I could see this being abused, police charge in and attack otherwise peaceful protests on some other topic the government doesn't like and then charge everyone they take down with a felony removing their right to vote."
14963,ifh4n9,"I agree it needs to be reworded to rioters, or just Democrats in general since they are a vast majority of supporters of the violence, murder,looting,  corruption and mayhem. Or really the whole party needs to be labeled as a terrorist organization, you know since they openly support  Antifa and BLM, both terrorist and criminal organizations.

But trolling aside they do need to reword it to ""rioters""."

14966,ifh4n9,"The bill makes it clear that protesting is fine but if the protesters block roadways and block entrances to government buildings, for which they can be fined, then the fines will be increased."
14967,ifh4n9,I too comment before I read
14968,ifh4n9,"Yea me too, they need to criminalize protests in other states too.... time to fall in line"

14973,ifh4n9,"1. It specifically says rioting. 
2. You forgot the word *peacefully* that goes in front of assemble. 

I doubt you could even tell me who founded fascism, but you label things fascist."
14974,ifh4n9,Just walk away as fast as you can...
14975,ifh4n9,"""Whoa dude, stop. Quit destroying shit; you're making us look like arseholes.""

Also, protest organizers need to organize some private security and oust anyone getting rowdy. If it's the group at large that starts looting and getting rowdy and riotous and security can't keep up, then maybe reconsider your position or choice of groups to participate with."
14976,ifh4n9,[deleted]
14977,ifh4n9,"It‚Äôs probably the same answer to the question, should we blame good cops for bad cops?"
14978,ifh4n9,"Leave immediately. If you are actually peacefully protesting and rioting or looting starts, don't get caught up in breaking the law. Common sense."
14979,ifh4n9,If a peaceful protest turns into a violent spree of looting just leave and go home.
14980,ifh4n9,"If the person is committing a crime, report them to the police? One, it would help legitimize the movement as being peaceful and anti-violence and two, it would bring the police and protestors closer to the same goal."
14981,ifh4n9,"Yeah, this is a tough question.  Some people just say walk away, but then that means that anyone who wants to ruin a legitimate protest can just pretend to join it and destroy property and it's over.

I don't know if maybe we need like a protocol where as soon as violence and looting starts all who oppose that have a rallying point, a muster point, then retreat to that point and as a group kind of call the violence and looting out.  Like kind of pause the protest and actually work with police, if they're around, to stop it before continuing.  This requires people to act in a coordinated way though, which won't happen.  

I guess also just getting video of that behavior and verbal calling out is as best we can do, which we sometimes saw in the early part of Floyd protests; Antifa was busting up windows and some people who seemed to be there out of a legitimate concern would video it and yell at them to stop, a few even detained a guy and handed him over to police.  

At the individual level though, it is true, you should just get away from that kind of behavior."
14982,ifh4n9,There‚Äôs cameras everywhere at all of these protest.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs possible to prove who is destroying things and who is practicing their 1st amendment rights.  I would assume a majority of the people aren‚Äôt guilty
14983,ifh4n9,"crowds can stop the bad apples in a case like this, just as some people stopped the rioters / looters in june."
14984,ifh4n9,"I've a feeling that if BLM did speak up, you'd move the goalpost...."
14985,ifh4n9,ok
14986,ifh4n9,"Smashing windows, burning buildings, preventing first responders from helping people. These are crimes. No one has the right to destroy someone's property because their upset, nor prevent someone providing aid or saving a life. Even the Portland mayor denounced the rioters who blocked entrances/exits and set fire to a police precinct WHILE PEOPLE WERE STILL INSIDE!

This isn't going to end until people stop enabling the violence. As long as it continues the movement is doomed to failure."

14989,ifh4n9,">Takes a long ass time for shit to get done these days.

And that's the American government for you"
14990,ifh4n9,I believe the fines are for camping out on federal/state property. Someone will hopefully fact check me.
14991,ifh4n9,It is basically.  Reinforces what already is the current law with extra fines.
14992,ifh4n9,"Legally, you need a permit to protest. So, follow the rules... and you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs easy to not get fines"
14993,ifh4n9,I feel like it can be abused so easily. In a crowded protest and things start to get a little rough and boom. The police can arrest everyone there for rioting and minimum 45 days in jail.
14994,ifh4n9,Because everything is
14995,ifh4n9,It does say increased fines for protesters with no mention of riots so their point stands my dude
14996,ifh4n9,"Ah that's a lot clearer, thankyou."
14997,ifh4n9,Ok THAT makes sense.  Blocking things is not ‚Äúpeaceably assembling‚Äù
14998,ifh4n9,"Okay thanks for the clarification, I was worried for a little bit there"
14999,ifh4n9,"No not peaceful protests, just the riots and people causing damage to property"
15000,ifh4n9,Yeah.
15001,ifh4n9,Yup
15002,ifh4n9,That‚Äôs how you‚Äôll end up charged with resisting arrest.
15003,ifh4n9,"exercising your rights should not require that you can get private security. that's what the police are for. I am aware of the irony of that when it comes to protests against the police, and the challenges of police preventing rioting in those situations, but that's what the police should be trying to do.

also, of you condemn every person at a BLM protest because they riot, then what about the Charlottesville protestors who were near those who yelled about Jews, or the armed protestors in the Michigan capital who did nothing about the people giving Nazi salutes? I'm not defending rioters, or calling all armed protestors Nazis. I'm saying that it's not reasonable to take unorganized crowds and demonize them all"
15004,ifh4n9,I just remember that one security guy kicking a white guy in the head as hard as he could
15005,ifh4n9,"yeah no. someone looting should face consequences. people in the vicinity are not responsible, and should not face consequences for someone else's actions.

people have the right to peacefully assemble. that right is not at all dependant on whether other people abuse theirs. you have the right to own a gun. that should not depend on whether other gun owners are abusing that right."
15006,ifh4n9,This was more so about bring in the same vicinity and being arrested simply because you were seen near them. Say you‚Äôre walking by a store and someone jumps out next to you with boxes at the exact moment the police show up. They won‚Äôt know you‚Äôre not guilty
15007,ifh4n9,"They are going after the leaders, the people who are organizing the riots"
15008,ifh4n9,"Well if we blame any group for the actions of a few bad apples, we‚Äôre doing that group a disservice. And that applies both ways to cops and BLM."
15009,ifh4n9,Right but do you have to sit in jail for however long it takes for the police to get around to watching the tape? And if you‚Äôre falsely imprisoned under this bill is there any recourse or restitution?

15020,ifh4n9,Kinda easy to tell if people are about to loot... Being right next to a store at a protest where everyone's face is covered and tensions are high is a pretty good indication to walk the other way lol people need to use simple judgement
15021,ifh4n9,">exercising your rights should not require that you can get private security.

True, however BLM definitely has the funds to make this happen. It may even help improve their image if they police themselves a bit. Also maybe publicly denounce the rioters giving them a bad name, and encourage political supporters to do the same."
15022,ifh4n9,"Nobody cares about peaceful protestors, nobody is demonising them. They are free to protest all they want. There was plenty of videos of cops having conversations with peaceful crowds and kneeling with them at the start of all this.

If people in your protest start getting violent either at police or damaging property then there are two options: kick them out of the group or (if there's too many) get out of there because it is no longer a protest, it has become a riot.

All of the videos I've seen of police getting violent with rioters was well after this point. Small groups had started the violence (yes throwing bottles at police officers is violence) and the larger groups didn't stop them or kick them out. What choice do police have but call it a riot and start dispersing the crowd? Are they supposed to keep standing there and just take it? If you're still there after police have called it a riot and asked the crowd to go home, then you aren't a protestor anymore, you have become a rioter and are just as bad as the people causing the violence."
15023,ifh4n9,"They were all called out and ostracized by the group there. Not one single person supported those idiots at Charlottesville. They were universally condemned. Also notice how you separated the armed protesters and the neo-nazis all on your own there? We do that too. Nobody likes them. Also notice that not one single arrest nor violent incident occurred during the armed Virginia protests. Not a SINGLE one. I'd for sure have the Virginia protest with a few racist assholes, where nobody has to die, over the violent bullshit we have now all over the country in the name of BLM with dozens upon DOZENS of people getting hurt or dying in a single weekend.

The problem with BLM is at it's root. The leaders of the organization itself are the root and cause of our problems with it. Look at their list of demands form their website and look at the orders handed down from on high. You can protest the police all you want, but as soon as you shout BLM and stand with those terrorists, you lose the silent majority as supporters. The idea that Black lives do, in fact, matter? 100% I support that in the same vein that I support White lives, Blue lives, Orange, Yellow, and Brown lives; however, I don't see any Ronald McDonald houses being looted in the name of All Lives Matter. I definitely see the need for better police training so that we don't have a repeat of George Floyd; however, defunding isn't the answer.

Last point, yes it is in fact, the job of the event organizers to ensure the safety of their participants. Whether they hire armed security or just have a volunteer committee of 'bouncers' makes no difference. The sole purpose is for them to oust the bad eggs who would necessitate police intervention to maintain safety at large for everyone and everything surrounding your protest. Those neo-nazis at Charlottesville, whilst racist and reprehensible, did not break any laws. They did not violate anyone's rights. They did not burn any statues, loot any stores, kill or maim any people. 

**Right now, if I was forced to pick one or the other, I'd take those literal neo-nazis over a BLM rioter because at least the neo-nazi doesn't want to hurt me or burn my fucking home to the ground.** I disagree and find reprehensible everything that comes out of their mouth, but at this point the only difference between the two groups is that the neo-nazis aren't hurting anyone and that PAINS me to say.

I really REALLY want to have reasonable discussions with you lot on the BLM side, but I just cannot have a discussion with someone who comes into it without being able to acknowledge the shortcomings on the group at large and it's inherent beliefs as laid out by the groups founders and organizers."
15024,ifh4n9,"Oh, Marquise Love? Oh wait, that wasn't a security guy... whoops.

Oh right! Jun 4th, Portland, Deleon and the Unnamed 14 year old boy! Wait they aren't security either.

Sgt. Jesse Franklin who kicked the inmate who bit his boot? Well Jesse is facing assault charges and rightfully so. Still not security though.

Jordan Hunt from Canada? not security.

Maybe people should stop kicking other people in the fucking head. Like... everyone and actually hold those accountable who do commit these acts of violence."

Edit: but yes, I do agree partially."
15042,ifh4n9,"Its true that BLM has funds, but the majority of protests are not organized by BLM. And the actual BLM leaders do denounce the rioters and violent people. There are BLM activists who try to encourage protestors to stop and distance themselves from non-peaceful protestors. 

Having your slogan be your organizations name is a bad idea in my opinion, since anyone can call themselves BLM, or shout it without the organization agreeing."
15043,ifh4n9,"I agree that when there is a riot that police should disperse the crowd. My point is that while it would be a good idea for the protestors to try to remove/stop anyone escalating a situation, holding them responsible as a group is not right. Expecting people to either monitor other people to exercise their rights, or to stop exercising then because other people are breaking a law is wrong. Law abiding gun owners should not be expected to make other gun owners follow the law, and they should not have their rights infringed because someone else broke the law.

As far as video evidence goes, there are so many videos that can be used to support any argument. In my opinion there are good and bad people who are in these protests, and there are good and bad people who are cops. We need to be fair and objective, and not resort to punishing a majority of either group because we are too lazy to differentiate between individuals."
15044,ifh4n9,So... if the police don‚Äôt like peaceful protesters they can say ‚Äúgo home you are rioters‚Äù suddenly it counts as a riot?
15045,ifh4n9,"James Alex Fields Jr. drove a car into the crowd of counter protestors. Explain to me how that makes Charlottesville a non violent protest. 

 Notice how I differentiated between protestors and neo Nazis there? But how you refer to rioters as ""BLM rioters? I am not the problem here. 

I'm sure that you find it frustrating that people on the left don't make and effort to educate themselves and understand that most people on the right were against the minority at Charlottesville. Now do what you expect from them, and actually seek out what people in the organization are saying. News outlets will always present things as more outrageous than they are.


You can criticise BLM for a variety of reasons, and I think there are legitimate grounds for criticism. But if there is one thing that I hope you are able to realize is the goals of 99% of people at BLM, or related rallies: they are there because they believe, whether right or wrong, that people are being treated unfairly, hurt, and killed, at the hands of  people supposed to serve and protect. Agree or disagree, you need to understand that they are there for an altruistic reason. If you think they are wrong, fine. Talk to people, give your opinion, back it up with studies, data, or whatever lead you to your opinion.

But what you can't do is use this false equivalence between fringe individuals at BLM rallies, and neo Nazis. White nationalist organizations espouse violence and hatred. BLM simply have the opposite goal. 

If you are actually concerned about individuals commiting violence, you should be worried about neo Nazis and other white nationalists.

The only way that you can justify the statement ""I would pick neo Nazis over rioters"" is that you pick targeted violence and terror targeted at non-white people, over rioters who make no discrimination. And that would be contrary to your statement that you care about all lives equally, now wouldn't it?

as soon as someone does something illegal, then I'm fine with them being arrested. but I have a fundamental disagreement with anything that limits constitutional rights in any way, just because there is potential that some people might misuse them. if we ban people from ""showing up in full gear, with weapons and shields"" then how long before 2a protests are banned?

as much as it sucks, there is no way to preemptively prevent all crimes without severely infringing on rights and individual freedoms"
15047,ifh4n9,"Exactly. The people that are currently ""protesting"" are pro-police. The ones against are currently ""rioters""."
15048,ifh4n9,Yeah but by then you‚Äôve spent at least a day in jail for something you didn‚Äôt do and then you‚Äôre just told ‚Äúsorry. Oh and btw you don‚Äôt get any kind of restitution or recourse for being falsely imprisoned‚Äù I can‚Äôt imagine if you were in that situation you‚Äôd be all ‚Äúthe courts will figure this out for me‚Äù

15052,ifh4n9,"Right, but we have to be very careful with how we word these bills because they do have potential to become a double edged sword"
15053,ifh4n9,I agree but unfortunately there's probably no best way to go about it since there are people rioting and looting ruining for everyone else
15054,ifh4n9,"Your point discounts the lives/livelihoods at stake.

If you see a crime being committed you are morally responsible for reporting it right? If people in your group (standing right next to you) are breaking the law and you aren't reporting it or getting out of there then you become an accomplice to the crime. I'll get a bit extreme here to make the point; if one of those guys at the Michigan protest started shooting at people in the building and the guys around him just stood there and didn't stop him or get out of there, would you apply guilt to all of them? Because I would. Once you become part of the group you are responsible for what happens in the group insofar as you can control situation. Staying there and doing nothing makes you an accomplice. 

I just don't get how you can stand there and feign ignorance when people around you are burning down buildings and throwing rocks at cops. You don't get to say ""they're not with us"". You have to do something about them."

15063,ifh4n9,"Morally yeah, I believe that people should try to do the right thing. I also don't believe in legislating morality. I support your ability to defend yourself with a weapon, but  I personally believe that someone should make every effort to not hurt another person. If someone threatens you I think you should have every right to defend yourself, but morally I think you have an obligation to avoid hurting someone if at all possible. But I don't think that my morality should be legally enforced. 

I am not saying that a group of people is right for ignoring bad things. I'm saying that we can't consider them guilty in a legal sense. I'm the case of those men in the Michigan capital, I would consider them morally in the wrong for not trying to stop someone from shooting, just like I would consider a group of protestors in the wrong for not trying to stop one person from burning down a building. Bad protestors are a minority, and bad cops are a minority. 

Do you think we should consider all cops guilty if they don't proactively prevent the few bad ones from doing something wrong? 

And even if you do think that cops should be held responsible as a group, public servants are held to a higher standard than citizens. I know first aid and CPR, but I can't be held legally responsible if I don't try to help someone choking or having a heart attack, but someone in their EMT uniform can. Does not helping someone when I could make me a terrible person? Absolutely.  Should we have laws requiring people to make proactive efforts to do the right thing? Absolutely not."
15064,ifh4n9,"You literally say that Charlottesville is preferable because no one had to die. I'd like to ask why you feel the need to discredit the hundred of thousands of people protesting what they see as unnecessary violence, while at the same time arguing that neo Nazis aren't that bad, but I already know the answer to that.

My goal in replying to you isn't to change your opinion. It's to provide a counter to people like you who try to radicalise people who visit subs like this looking for reasonable political views that differ from other subs.

Just so you're aware Charlottesville Robert E Lee protest =/= Armed Virginia Protest

If you actually came here to discuss in good faith, you'd have made that distinction, but no. You're just flying off the handle and putting words in peoples mouths like a typical leftist. There is a damn good reason I make the distinction between the two protests as you've so neatly pointed out in your emotionally charged and inaccurate rant.

Amen brother. Amen. I'd like to point out, that your group is the ONLY group telling people to be angry and afraid at people for no other reason than the color of their skin. Sounds pretty racist to me, but hey, I'm just a scary minority who disagrees with you. Shock and horror."

So, if your data is correct, this means that there were atleast 109million arrests last year , more than double the United States black population(44 mill).

Then the same media says the riots are ‚Äúmostly peaceful‚Äù and dem leadership says they‚Äôre just fed up and acting out but mostly peaceful etc. the other part of this too is the police aren‚Äôt killing blacks because they‚Äôre racist.

>Gender interacts with but is different from sex, which refers to the different biological and physiological characteristics of females, males and intersex persons, such as chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs. Gender and sex are related to but different from gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person‚Äôs deeply felt, internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond to the person‚Äôs physiology or designated sex at birth.

From the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/guidance-documents-medical-devices-and-radiation-emitting-products/evaluation-sex-specific-data-medical-device-clinical-studies-guidance-industry-and-food-and-drug):

According to the [OED](https://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/77468), sex and gender have been distinguished in this exact way since at least 1945:

Surely, you arent suggesting that cops across the nation investigate violent crime only to drop everything based on the race of the eventual perp?  Youd have to back that up with some real good evidence if you were, because that shit would cause a firestorm."

15164,iurd6c,"Okay you tell me to wake up yet your eyes are closed to the dangers an officer go though. Between officers and other people officers are actually being executed for no reason. I can get you 3 minimum from the last 2 year. This isn't even a thing that started recently, you can go back though time and find stories of officers outright caught off guard and killed. 

 If you resist arrest alone you may get a little ruffed up maybe teased but it becomes a problem when the one resisting arrest gets a hold of the officer pistol, attempt to get the officers pistol, or gain access to another part of the officers tool kit that can get a hold of the officers pistol, riffle, or shotgun.

A general rule of thumb for the protection of officers is to go into an encounter one level above the other individual and to only try for non lethal when you have back up with lethal cover. 

You honestly need to look up what officers go though, why they do what they have to do, and how they do it.

1) Officer Stephen Carr was shot in his patrol car. December 19, 2019
2) Officer Michael Langsdorf was beaten over the head in a struggle and was out right executed. June 24th, 2019
3)Officers Edelmiro Garza & Officer Ismael Chavez where ambushed and killed. July 11th , 2020

You have four officers that where killed two ourtight targeted executions and one double ambushed. Your argument has no grounds for defending criminals that don't comply with officers that are just doing a job to protect and serve. You need to wake up and do some research that isn't provided by CNN or MSNBC. Just go out and talk to an officer if you want to understand the dangers. I promise they are nice people when you get to know them."
15165,iurd6c,"They dont.  More people are struck by lightning than unarmed black men are killed by police per year. More people win a multimillion dollar lottery per year.  

If police execute people, why are there still riots going on?  Wouldn't they all just be shot?  How come we still give murderers trials, the golden state killer was arrested.  Al Capone was arrested.  El Chapo was arrested.  Why not just executed by police?  Surely these are better targets?  

People are killed by police because they threaten them.  Jacob Blake fought them and reached for a knife.  Breanna Taylor's bf fired on police.  Maybe dont attack officers with a weapon and you wont get shot."
15166,iurd6c,"42 police have been killed since this started. That‚Äôs more than twice the number of ‚Äúunarmed black men killed‚Äù and more than triple the amount of actually unarmed blacks by cops.

They‚Äôre DEFENDING themselves and the public against people with weapons, people who are attacking them with weapons, people who are trying to reach for weapons to attack them. When you can name every single person shot by the cops and killed in a list of over 100 million interactions that means the number is so small that it‚Äôs not a habit it‚Äôs not a common occurrence. Read the real stories look at what actually happened. People are on the streets championing a rapist who attacked the police and went for a weapon while the police were there protecting a woman of color who‚Äôd reported the same man who raped her and stole her bank card who had come back while a restraining order was on him after he raped her again and stole her fucking keys. Come on don‚Äôt be blind do your research. Half the people in Lancaster PA rioting we‚Äôre doing so because someone started a rumor the cops had shot a 14 year old autistic kid. Even after the video comes out of a man opening his door charging the officer with a knife , the same man who‚Äôd stabbed 4 people a year earlier including a child. Half of you aren‚Äôt even mad about the right thing most of the time because nobody waits to hear what actually happened first and just let cnn and other lie to you."

That's all it's ever been, Only in the last decade, have radical leftist institutions and individuals, tried to change the definition of it, so as to support the fantasies of mentally ill people, who are so incredibly mentally ill, that they wish to become the sex they aren't.

You must live in reality. Your identity is NOT what you alone choose. Part of your identity, your sex, and the description/identification of your sex (gender), are chosen for you, at the MOMENT OF CONCEPTION.

Sex is non-negotiable.

15175,iurd6c,"""So you think there is a magical force out there deciding that people with XX chromosomes should wear certain things and exhibit certain social traits that are very different from those who have XY chromosomes?""

Yes, it's called biology.

""You‚Äôre claiming your perspective is rooted in science but science doesn‚Äôt say 'females should love pink and wear make up and speak in a higher pitched voice.'""

Actually, it very much does.

""Why? Because gender is a SOCIAL BEHAVIOR THAT OFTEN ALIGNS WITH ONE‚ÄôS BIOLOGICAL SEX.""

Wrong. Gender is a literary description, and identification, of sex. It is not some additional character aspect that someone has, due to his or her own choosing. One can have feminine traits, and still be a man, or masculine traits, and still be a woman. But, his or her sex remains unchanged. You quite simply do not get to choose everything about your identity and existence. It's not possible. Sex is an objective determination, based on chromosomal science. You can be a man and wear dresses. Still a man. You can be a woman and bind your breasts. Still a woman. Simple, no?

""Your argument is purely delusional. And the fact that you get so angry about people wanting to dress differently and be treated differently (treated refers to social treatment...because gender...is....100%...social....behavior....and your opinions on whether those behaviors align with biology are OPINIONS) highlights an important insecurity in your own gender identity.""

Bwahahaha. I don't care if someone wants to dress differently. It doesn't make me angry, or feel any way, whatsoever, how you want to dress. If you're a man and want to wear a thong and bra, go ahead. I couldn't care less. My point is simply: You're still a man. You're a man, who is role playing, as a woman. You can pretend and enjoy pretending that you are the opposite sex. It is still pretend, and there's zero reason that I should have live in your fantasy: Especially a fantasy that exists due to your mental illness. Let me ask you this, in all seriousness: What is a woman? What is a man? Tell me. Give me an a concrete, objective definition of what a woman is, and what a man is. But, you can't, can you? Because if anyone can be anything they want to be, simply by speaking it into existence, there is no definition for man or woman, is there? It's all completely subjective! See how absurd that is? It would be like me, right here, right now, saying that I'm ""Santa Claus"" because I ""feel"" like a jolly old fat man who magically delivers gifts to boys and girls across the world instantaneously. That's who I am. My identity is Santa Claus. Deal with it. Now, would the ENTIRE RATIONAL WORLD be expected to entertain my delusional fantasy about being ""Santa Claus"" inside? OF COURSE NOT. There is a REAL, OBJECTIVE, RATIONAL world that has laws and rules that are unbreakable. One such law is your chromosomal DNA. It says whether or not you are a man, or a woman. And ""gender"" is merely a way to describe manhood, and womanhood, using words. That's all gender is, and will ever be.

""Please stop claiming to be rooted in logic when it‚Äôs impossible to arrive at your conclusion using logic alone. Most educated people see this clearly, but you point to people like Ben Shapiro who rely 100% on steamrolling to avoid having their arguments taken into serious question.""

The influence of social constructs is only minimal.

""...and also explain why they are not called sex roles.""

Because gender is the literary device, the words, we use to describe sex. They are, indeed, related, but not the same thing. One is a descriptor of the other.

""You can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs because gender is a social behavior.""

Nope. I've already explained to you that gender is a mere descriptor of sex identity in the literary realm. And sex, yes, it results in predictable ""social behaviors."" So what?

Yes, it is.

Pretty sure I just did, sugar tits.

""Correlation of things does not just mean that they are literary descriptors of each other. Find me an article that uses science to show that gender and sex are the same thing.""

Gender and sex are not the same thing. Gender is the literary description, and identification, of sex. One is a descriptor of another. When I call you a ""man"" or a ""woman,"" that is your gender, and said DESCRIPTION is based ENTIRELY on your chromosomes. Someone with an XY chromosomal pairing (man) may indeed typically have masculine character traits. And, someone with an XX chromosomal pairing (woman) may indeed have feminine character traits. But, they don't have to.

""You cannot, and will not, find evidence of this because it is a matter of definitions.""

Wrong. Sex is NOT SUBJECTIVE. We're talking about OBJECTIVE REALITY, here. The real world. Based on a basic scientific principle that in terms of mammalian biology, there are two sexes, and that's pretty much it.

""‚ÄúLiberals‚Äù loosely define gender as behavior and norms that have traditionally been associated with biological sex.""

Actually, only wrong people define gender at all. Gender is a descriptor, or definition, for one's sex. It is defining something else, sex.

""Dense egos like you choose to adhere to a much more strict definition and think you are justified in arguing endlessly about it. Arguing about definitions is a waste of time because there is no authority to lend credibility to one side or the other.""

Well, I have all of the human history of biological science as my evidence and authority, where you have mere ""feelings"" and your subjectively defined nonsense. So, I've already won the argument. It happened five comments ago. I've merely kept going, because it's enjoyable to continue to tell you that you're wrong.

""But the reality is that you understand the compassionate argument that liberals make, and you are just angry about it because you want to hate the world instead of just love people.""

Feelings, and compassion, have NO PLACE in objective reality. Save your feelings to whomever is pounding you with a strapon. Do I understand your argument? Yes, that's why I dismantled it completely. Wrong people need to be corrected.

""You are and forever will be miserable.""

My, that's some wild, baseless conjecture on your part, with zero evidence. Bizarre that reality is so subjective for you, that you invent little stories in your mind about my life, for which there is no basis. I mean, really, really, strange.

""You will reply to me claiming that you are actually super happy.""

Haha. Isn't it funny that I didn't do so? Instead, I simply pointed out yet another instance of you making a determination based on no evidence. Why? Because the way I feel in any given moment, is irrelevant to this conversation. Feelings are irrelevant to reality. Learn to think critically. Ditch the feelings. They aren't helpful when it comes to understanding the world.

""But when you are on your death bed (hopefully way later in life) I hope you remember this conversation because you will look back and realize that I was right, and you wasted your life being angry and getting worked up over an argument based in the semantics of definitions. Best of luck.""

Look, I have no idea why you are so motivated by this topic. I'm sure you must be one of the alphabet people, or care about one of the alphabet people, and that's why this is so personal to you. But, here's a tip: Let go of your personal motivations, when it comes to examining the world, and coming to conclusions that are as close to the truth as can be possible. You only do yourself a disservice, when you are blinded by emotion and feelings. There is an objective world, and that means most of your identity in life is determined at the moment of conception. It's really that simple. If you're born with XY chromosomes, your identity can be a crossdresser, or a transvestite. That's something you can decide. What you do not get to decide, is your sex. So, you can never be a woman. There isn't any power in the universe that can change your sex. You may desperately want to be a woman. You may dream about it. Fantasize about it. Enjoy the pageantry of pretending to be a woman. Fine. Enjoy it. But, that does not change reality. And, reality is where we all live. Accept it. You'll ultimately be happier."

While I don't want to go down the rabbit hole on this one too far, I took a moment to research at least one of these concepts: the purported ancient cave drawings of aliens. Now, there are other theories as to what these drawings actually depict, and none of the theories are any less plausible.

1. They could be depictions of visions the artist had while hallucinating, either due to consuming a hallucinogenic plant, or hallucination from exhaustion, disease, or illness.

2. They could be depictions of the dreams of primitive humans.

3. They could be depictions of visual anomalies (such as when your eyes play tricks on you when you see something at an odd angle, and only briefly). Much like people who think they see Bigfoot in the wild, when it's likely something else.

4. The artist could have been mentally ill, such as having schizophrenia.

And these are only four possibilities, from a much longer list of competing theories. And that's only if the cave drawings are, in fact, a depiction of something actually seen, rather than something invented in the primitive human mind or created for the purpose of storytelling, etc.

With this in mind, yes. I need much stronger evidence. That's how the rational mind works."
15203,iurd6c,"You didnt read or consider my comment correctly. Try it again and instead of looking for a contradiction that doesnt exist, try to understand. Nowhere did I suggest whites are underpoliced. I said in order to believe that blacks as a race dont commit more violent crimes than whites, you have to believe whites are underpoliced. Its a logical conclusion, no statistics required. The alternative is believing blacks commit more violent crimes - a racist belief. What alternative is there and in what way is that not racist? Its literally ___ race does something more than ____ race. That's racism to accept that without more variables, namely nonracial variables.

Edit- I guess I do suggest that whites are underpoliced in comparison, because I dont believe the openly racist concept that blacks commit more violent crimes. I recognize blacks have more convictions per capita as a race than whites do, but convictions and policing go hand in hand. 

Thats not the same as suggesting some city I could name actively underpolices whites, but I could point to rural areas of the country where whites absolutely are underpoliced. In general, America is overpoliced imo. Im speaking in comparison by race."
15204,iurd6c,how does that make me racist. ITS A FACT. idc what you say. The african american population is  around 13% in the us.
15205,iurd6c,"Not at all. Statistics show correlations and not causation. And they only show the correlation they show- convictions for violent crimes, not all happenings of violent crimes. That is a fact and not a redundant one or a minor detail. Its a fact of statistics. I took it a step further and said if you believe that, in this case, correlation is causation, that is that being black has a causal relationship with violent crimes and/or vice versa, that is a racist belief. By definition. There are more variables at play than race alone.

The 13-50 is true. When you try to expand on that and claim that 50% represents a percentage of crimes commited, and not a percentage of convictions for those crimes, youre stretching the facts. Its 50% of convictions for violent crimes are committed by a race that comprises 13% of the population. I cant find a reason to cite that statistic outside of calling for reform in law enforcement practices. It does not show that blacks commit more violent crimes. It shows they are convicted of more crimes. Thats it. That fact is not racist. Its only ever brought up to defend against the claim that police treat blacks differently. Its used as a ""No, blacks just commit more crimes and policing (and the court system) is equal across all races, so the numbers reflect reality."" And that kind of belief requires a stretching of the available facts in an openly racist way to justify not changing the system. You either believe the conviction statistic reflects the reality of crimes committed or you believe that the system provides different outcomes for different races and result in a lopsided correlation between race and violent crime convictions.

This can basically be described as the societally understood labor responsibilities, style of dress, manner of communication, body language, physical appearance (haircuts, makeup), desired traits, etc. the intricacies of which aren't tied to biology at all.  


An obvious and layman's example of this is the masculine and feminine colors in western society: blue and pink respectively. There is **nothing** about our biology that ties us as men to the color blue. In fact,[up to the 20th century](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-did-girls-start-wearing-pink-1370097/) pink was also considered to be a traditional boys color. So these characteristics that we consider to make up a gender, are arbitrary across human history, except where the lines are blurred in societies like ours where we have a gender binary AND the same corresponding sexual binary.   


You should know about the Hijra's in India, existing as a socially accepted sub-population that probably has the same dysphoria condition as transgenders in the United States, but nevertheless has been historically accepted there into a schema of at least 3 accepted genders for hundreds of years, having their own social norms and roles in societies, that aren't tied to their sex characteristics.   


It should be easily understood that since gender is simply the degree of conformance to arbitrary norms created naturally around societal roles, and sex is the biological reality and binary that everyone is born into, its possible for groups like the Hijra for exist for hundreds of years and literally take on the meaning of 3rd gender, in a society where you could never say ""gender is simply a device which we use to describe biological sex"". We don't speak Indian languages, but if we did that simply couldn't be their understanding.   


We should basically take on the habit of describing males and females as males and females, if anything just to gain clarity in how to organize society in a world that increasingly thinks its okay to discard old and invent new social frameworks on-the-fly every other week. Describe things biologically, and ""please for the love of god"" engage with terms and language correctly."
15209,iurd6c,"my dude

economics *is* a social science"
15210,iurd6c,I wasn't asking you to refute the existing evidence. I was asking what evidence you consider irrefutable. I'm sure we could do something silly like refute the existence of covid-19 too. How do we know it's not just a flu? ....
15211,iurd6c,"I read your comment fine.  You're saying police under enforce violent crime where the perpetrator isnt black.  SHOW ME A SOURCE.  You cant, so now you're talking down to me.  You're still saying in this reply that white violent crime is under enforced.  SOURCE?  You dont have one.  You're fee-fees are hurt though.  The statistics are OBAMA's statistics, his FBI.  I'm sorry that you dont like that 50% of all violent crime is committed by an African American, but facts are facts.  Stop making up shit just because it doesnt fit your narrative.  Stop being a dumbshit."
15212,iurd6c,"police go where the crime is. if police were in white neighborhoods bc thats where the crime is, than thats where the crime is. You seriously cant be suggesting police get out of bad neighborhoods bc of race. I dont mean the neighborhoods are bad just because of race, there are higher crime rates in black neighborhoods"
15213,iurd6c,"Doesn‚Äôt matter which party does most breaks, it was an example.

Yes. You can make that claim."
15214,iurd6c,"Technically correct but you still fail to understand the point, as I already said it's mostly a social science but it uses mathematics, which means it is automatically more reliable/trustworthy/evidence based than the rest of the social sciences, which don't even use mathematics. See:

\> Economics does rely on a lot of iffy shit. However, it still uses far  more quantifiable evidence and hard math, and is demonstrably more  provable and effective than any concept in the social sciences.

You can use economics to see general trends in data based on numerical evidence. Making up genders and trying to justify pedophilia/women=men etc as sociologists do is simply mental illness turned academic."
15215,iurd6c,"""How do we know it's not just a flu?""

Um, because the virus is actually examined under a microscope, as well as by other scientific instruments/methodologies, and its molecular structure is somewhat different than influenza?

Just a wild guess."
15216,iurd6c,"You are literally talking down to me and all I did was suggest you reread my comment. When your buddy says ""hey thats not what I said, listen clearly"" do you go off like this? Ill try one more time but I dont know how to explain it to you any other way. Ive explained it fine. 

Im agreeing that 13/50 is true and reiterating that the 50% is not all violent crimes committed. It cannot be. That number is unknowable by definition unless we have a 100% conviction rate and no unsolved crimes. These are facts about what that 50% number means. It is not and cannot be a percentage of all crimes committed, unless you believe that all violent crimes are solved and result in a proper conviction. I assume no one believes that bc it's obviously untrue. 

What it says is a race that comprises 13% of total population is the race of 50% of the total violent crime convictions. Im not being overly detailed or trying to get over with some grammar- it is what it is. Blacks (13%) are the race of 50% of all violent crime convictions. Or more simply but not gramatically correct- Blacks (13%) are convicted of 50% of all violent crimes. Thats what the statistic says.

So, you either believe that there is a perfect relationship between policing and prosecuting crimes and the conviction statistics that result, or you believe theres an imperfect relationship. In other words, if all races are treated equally by police and the court system, it would mean blacks not only are convicted of 50% of all violent crimes, but that they also commit 50% of all violent crimes. That next step (from a race being convicted of a percentage of crimes to a race committing a percentage of crimes) requires that belief that policing and the courts have a perfect relationship with the reality of committed crimes. It requires the belief that all violent crimes are solved and properly prosecuted. We know at least that the last part cannot be true- not all violent crimes are solved and prosecuted. Hell, not all violent crimes are reported. You cannot believe that the courts and police systems result in a perfect relationship between crimes committed and convictions for crimes committed. You cannot do it.  It is racist to suggest that race is the causation for the correlation in the statistics. You cannot make the leap from convictions to overall crimes committed. You just can't. Its not a partisan or political belief- its a logical one."
15217,iurd6c,"""All I did was suggest you reread my comment"". 

Really, is that all you did?  

""You didnt read or consider my comment correctly. Try it again and instead of looking for a contradiction that doesnt exist, try to understand.""   

Oh, I'll try to understand all right buddy.  Maybe you can talk down to me more?   Have you tried that?  

""But I dont know how to explain it to you any other way"".  

Oh I guess you did try.  Keep it up, it's good discourse.  

First, the statistics are not convictions.  They're arrests.  Second, they also show similar statistics for victims, who dont require full investigations.  And finally, I never suggested crime was because of race.  Thats all you bud.  

But it is nonetheless fact that the violent crime is committed by African americans.  Idk why.  Perhaps 1960s era laws had an effect?  Perhaps it's to do with democratic cities like chicago where there are hundreds of shootings every weekend and no response?  Perhaps it's to do with gang culture?  I have no idea.  But you see these statistics and jump, WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE, to the conclusion that whites must be underinvestigsted.  SHOW ME THE SOURCE.  You don't have one.  You're assuming that police are racist.  You're assuming that white people are privileged.  You're assuming that the only possible reason black people may be over represented is because they're being treated unfairly. 

THAT, my friend, is the true racism.  Have a good one."

It failed, but it is just like all these attempts by the left to get rid of Donald J. Hitler spoke adamantly against the jews, blaming them for having to much wealth, kind of like how the left tries to tarnish white Americans. With the whole.... ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù myth. Both supported abortion. Controlling the media. Mass propaganda. The list goes on and on."

Nooo.... it proves they were nationalists.  Human nature and politics are complex things.  Too many people try to boil complicated issues into a singular binary attribute.  It is unfair to declare conservatives similar to fascists due to one small overlap. Having national pride can be a good thing.  American conservatives aren‚Äôt going to start a campaign to conquer and absorb neighboring countries.  We aren‚Äôt seeking to cleanse blood lines.

Similarly, it is unfair to compare naziism with the modern left, simply because they had overlapping socialist beliefs.

This is the problem with the right-left mentality of a political spectrum.  The political spectrum is multi-dimensional."

They should equip the police with crayons and those restaurant coloring pages to deal with this group.

EDIT: After reading the comments below, a fellow redditor brought to our attention that this is a picture dating back to 2013, and that the A stands for Anarchists not ANTIFA (which I pretty much knew to begin with).

The authoritarian left wing in the US is ACTUALLY fascist. The people that they use as their bogeyman to justify their behavior are not. The vast majority of the victims of BLM and Antifa are just anyone who doesn't agree with the far left ideology.

Just call someone a ""fascist"" or a ""Nazi"" and the left has found a loophole through which they can cram their entire, destructive, toxic ideology through.

Lesbian dance theory, HR, gender studies, not so much...  The former should be free or heavily subsidized. It stays free as long as you do a minimum of xx years in that field.  America is paying people to go to school only for them to not use the education that was paid for.

I used to believe that also. But really, when it comes to things like pro-life/choice, balance budgets, gun rights, and many other issues, they're vastly different.

I read an article somewhere about how the Green Party, when making the ""both sides are the same"" argument, would mainly/only focus on (iirc) healthcare and foreign policy. That's because the Democrats and Republicans are largely different in other issues.

With Progressive Democrats on the rise, however, even healthcare is something they're getting increasingly divided about.

>I think party politics is for dummies

I've seen first hand how partisan a supposed ""nonpartisan"" government can be. While nonpartisan ballots can make it easier to vote third party (since voters wouldn't have the attitude of ""oh, this person is Green/Libertarian? I'll just be throwing my vote away if I vote for this person. So no thanks""), it also makes it easier to, for example, accidentally vote for someone who is (in practice) a pro-choice Democrat.

15634,j72ze8,"Agreed.  I think the lack of public funding has enabled the vultures of private loans to become part of the problem.  We see a bit of elasticity as the schools expand to charge to the available amount of money provided by these private loans.  This is not sustainable.  


>  I mean, I‚Äôm a trade worker and even I‚Äôve noticed how crooked it is to charge so much if someone legitimately wants to better themselves through education. 

I've got a bit of a problem with how we handle the trades as well.  Our apprenticeship system should look like the Germans.  It shouldn't be just the unions, but the government should ENABLE (not take over) these groups to train more men and women to be the best damn tradesmen that they can be. 

For example, when I was young, you had tech schools as young as the 7th grade.  Now, the money has dried up.  If you want to be an HVAC tech, give Johnson Controls or Honeywell very liberal tax breaks to build and staff tech schools for our junior high and high schoolers.  When a young fella graduates high school, he goes to an advanced school (again, subsidized by the government and ran by private industry and the unions).  Then he does 2 years of apprenticeship (or whatever that field dictates).  By the age of 24-25, you have a highly skilled worker that can compete against any S.O.B. on the planet."

As for incentives?  We already have one.  Tax code.  It is quite simple to say that whoever builds a tech center that is approved by the marriage of private industry and the unions can receive wonderful tax breaks.  The upside is also that these industries receive a wonderful pool of highly trained workers.

We're so used to big, inefficient government that we cannot envision the way gub'mint is SUPPOSED to work.  We're so used to those folks expecting government to fully solve problems (and trying unsuccessfully to make that shit work) that we forget how it CAN work. Because both groups (private industry and unions) have self-interest, this is a perfect example of beneficial capitalism and the utilization of limited government."

15845,hbzn0f,"When did the parties switch, again?

My favorite game is ""pin the year of the switch"".

‚Ä¢	‚Å†It definitely wasn't before 1921, when Woodrow Wilson presided.  The Democrat president who massively expanded the power of the KKK ‚Ä¢	‚Å†It wasn't before 1964, when the Republican Senate and House both voted for the Civil Rights act in far greater numbers than the Democrats did (~80% Repub vs. ~60% Dem) ‚Ä¢	‚Å†It wasn't before 1993, when the Democrats elected their first ever Black Senator, Carol Moseley Braun, D-Illinois (yes...it took 217 years for the Democrats to elect a Black person).  The first black Republican Senator was in 1827. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†1993 was also the year that the longest serving Senator in American history, Democrat Robert Byrd, finally openly renounced his KKK support.  He did still use terms like like ""white n****r"" up to a decade later.  The same Robert Byrd that Hillary Clinton called a ""friend and mentor"".

If you want to watch a Leftist's brain shut down, hit them with that.  Pure dissonance ensues. 

The Democratic Party started in the 1820s. Right away, it switched sides, as we can see from the fact that they pushed for the removal and extermination of Indians. Also, their opposition was the Whig party, which was against the Indian Removal Act and vowed to protect minorities against mob rule. Because the sides were switched, the vast majority of Whig party were anti-slavery.

(Eventually, there was rift in the party over the issue of slavery, and anti-slavery members of the Whig party, including Abraham Lincoln, exited the party and formed the Republican Party. As we can see, the parties must have switched again because it's common knowledge that republicans are actually the racist ones.)

Then the parties switched when the democrats are on record as having mainly been the ones who owned slaves. Not all democrats owned slaves, but 100% of slaves were owned by democrats. Not a single republican in history owned a slave.

As we know, the parties switched again when republicans repudiated slavery and democrats defended it, leading to the civil war.

Then the parties switched again when a democrat assassinated republican Lincoln.

After the civil war, the parties switched again during the reconstruction era, when republicans attempted to pass a series of civil rights amendments in the late 1800s that would grant citizenship for freedmen. As evidence of the switch, the democrats voted against giving former slaves citizenship, but the civil rights amendments passed anyway.

The parties switched again when the Democratic Party members founded the KKK as their military arm. Democrats then attempted to pass the first gun control law in order to keep blacks from having guns and retaliating against their former owners. A county wanted to make it illegal to possess firearms, unless you were on a horse. (Hmmm wonder who rode around on horses terrorizing people ü§î). Gun control has always been a noble cause touted by democrats, but the racist reasons why the concept of gun control was dreamed up was a part of a party mentality switch, but not the actual party.

Somewhere around this time former slaves fought for gun rights for all, and the NRA was formed. The NRA switched parties too when they defended the right for blacks to arm themselves and white NRA members protected blacks from racist attackers.

The parties switched again when republicans fought to desegregate schools and allow black children to attend school with white children, which democrats fought fiercely against.

The nation saw a rash of black lynchings and bombings of black churches by the democrats in the KKK and the parties switched again when Democrat Bull Conner tried to avoid prosecuting the racist bombers to get them off the hook. When blacks protested this injustice, the party-switched democrat Bull Conner sicced dogs and turned the hose on them. He also gave police stand down orders when the KKK forewarned attacks on the freedom riders, who had switched parties.

The parties switched again when a Democratic Party president appointmented the first and only KKK member to the Supreme Court.

The parties switched yet again when Democratic president FDR put Asians in racist internment camps.

Then parties switched again when the democrats filibustered the passing of the second set of civil rights laws giving equal protection to minorities.

The parties switched when a democrat assassinated MLK.

This brings us to modern times. The parties continue to switch all the time.

The parties switched when democrats proposed racist policies like affirmative action to limit opportunities for certain racial groups in order to grant privilege to other racial groups.

The parties switched when the Islamic fundamentalist Omar Mateen and several other ISIS mass shooters aligned themselves with democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

The parties switched again when liberal student groups in schools like UCLA and Berkeley call for segregated housing to make ""separate but equal"" housing quarters for black students. Actually this is a current ongoing thing, so the parties are right now in the middle of switching on this topic.

Parties always switched currently now that democrats are rioting and violently protesting democracy.

So as you can see, because of Party switching, democrats were always the ones who stood up against racism and wanted peace and unity while republicans were always the racist and violent ones calling for division and discord."

15851,hbzn0f,Okay let‚Äôs talk parties. I am a moderate individual who is not a huge fan of Trump. Democrats were racist as can be and the idea that republicans became that party has been disproven so many times. The populations and demographics just simply changed. I mean heck as of 2005 Democrats were pro building a wall on the southern boarder. In 2008 democrats were opposed to legalizing gay marriage. All the democrats really stand for is whatever will get them the most power. They don‚Äôt care about morality and anything else.

From Wikipedia, ""The GOP was pro-business, and it supported banks, the gold standard, railroads and high tariffs"" sounds a lot like the modern GOP. Isn't Trump pushing for higher tariffs? I constantly hear people on the left complain that the GOP only cares about businesses and the bankers. How is this description anything like the modern day left?"

15879,hbzn0f,"When LBJ made the great society  in order to get the black vote. Black Americans swapped from republican to democrat. (Look up his quote). Of course, the rest of the republicans stayed the same and supported limited government and equal rights."
15880,hbzn0f,Supposedly in the 1950's and '60s. It's an excuse Democrats use when they can't accept that their party always has had major issues with race.
15881,hbzn0f,"Poli sci and law professor at Vanderbilt. She is intelligent and qualified. That is enough. Also, we can see just fine without the caps, Karen."
15882,hbzn0f,"One political campaign strategy doesn't equate to the parties 'switching', nor does it absolve the Democratic party of their history of slavery.

I agree with your desire for a post racial world where actions matter and skin color doesn‚Äôt. Unfortunately, that world is not America in 2020. I think we agree on that statement. 

I‚Äôm not gonna argue that the Democrats methods are good or not. I won‚Äôt even argue in favor or democratic leadership - I think many of them are failing my ideals. At this point I think Politics is a team sport where the goal is to win rather than do what‚Äôs right for America. But that‚Äôs about people and parties. 

I want to know the actual conservative ideology on something regardless of what politicians are doing. I think a post racial world where skin color doesn‚Äôt matter is the best target. I know that‚Äôs not the the world we live in. How should we get there? My understanding of the democratic viewpoint is that black Americans start out in a worse position due the effects of the history of racism in America and the best action now is to try and level the playing field. They want to try and address what they see as issues impeding equality. 

My understanding of the ideology I see around this post is that conservatives see that as adding to the divide and doing more harm than good. 

Help me get out of the echo chamber and understand what real conservatives want. How should America move from the current racially charged mess to a true post-racial meritocracy where skin color has no impact on quality of life and opportunity to improve it?"

15909,hbzn0f,"In 1964 when Lyndon Johnson who was a democrat passed the Civil rights act many members in the democratic party switched over to the republican party, the ones who switched were white segregationists known as dixiecrats, not the 1st it has happened either, president andrew jacksons policies caused party members to form a new party known as the whig party which opposed jacksonian ideology, they were able to elect 2 presidents, the whigs were the predecessor of the republican party"

15911,hbzn0f,Erasing the past and imposing responsibility on people with slave owning ancestors are different. History should never be erased. The successes and failures of history help us to not make the same mistakes
15912,hbzn0f,"Yeah, but I think that‚Äôs a flawed analogy. 

The kid may not serve the sentence, but is heavily, unavoidably affected by that sentence for the rest of his life, whether it be because they grew up without a parent, they were financially unstable because of it, or their parent was one of their only role models and they have and their ideas of right and wrong are horribly muddled. Not really the kids fault, but not really the justice systems fault either, as the justice system rightfully imprisoned a murderer.

However, slaves were not rightfully imprisoned. They were stolen from their homes and forced into it or born into it. Even debt peonage was wildly regarded as a joke, just an excuse to use slaves after the war. Look up Henry Flagler + Debt peonage for a good example. 

Anyways, those slaves were horribly negatively impacted by slavery, obviously, but what about their ancestors? Well, they had no inheritance, like their white contemporaries, so the first generation was already off to a bad start. Then, things like debt peonage, Jim Crow Laws, voting harassment, discriminatory hiring, redlining, disproportionate school funding, disproportionate policing and jailing, and a lack of basic social services all worked together in a pretty nasty way, until now, and likely, far into the future. They were never allowed to build wealth, and to this day it is very fucking difficult. 

All of theses systems were built by the politicians of old, but the current generation has done little to fix it. Recently what many considered the most important piece of the voting rights act was repealed, for no apparent reason other than ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need it anymore,‚Äù even though it did relatively little harm compared to the harm it was designed to prevent.

If you want a clear cut example, look to Tulsa in 1921, where ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street‚Äù, a shining gem of black economic success, was burnt to the ground over a rape allegation that turned out to be completely baseless, and looked that way from the get go. This was 60 years after the abolition of slavery. Entire generations later. My grandmother was born in 1918. I can‚Äôt imagine what my life would be like if instead of growing up on a peaceful South Carolina farm she instead had her childhood home burned to the ground by people who hated  her for the color of her skin. I imagine she wouldn‚Äôt have helped as much with my college.

TL;DR - The abolition of Slavery wasn‚Äôt the end of its role in American politics. The systems built by the Democrats (and Republicans) of old still exist in many forms today, just look at educational and policing data to see that. The scientific community has established that race largely doesn‚Äôt have a biological impact on cognition or criminality, so why are black people, enrolled in public schools and policed by the government, so disproportionately underperforming academically and disproportionately represented on our jails?

There are really only two answers that I see being possible - either the scientific community is wrong, and white people are genetically superior to blacks, or there is something systemic going on with our government and society, which has no more obvious cause than the 250 years (1619, first slave to America, 1869, last confederate surrender) of indentured servitude and subsequent 100 years (1869 - 1960s civil rights acts) of open animosity and discrimination from the government that the community has received."

A big part of their argument is how individual states voted in presidential elections, which sounds good at first, but when you really think about it, is totally irrelevant. If a state goes blue or red, who is that proof, that it is racist or not racist?   
Carter won southern states, therefore Nixion did not employ the southern strategy and Democrats are racist. That is their compelling argument.

Then continued that push into the Civil Rights era, by opposing legislation that was for equality and anti segregation.  Don't forget Robert Byrd, an actual KKK leader, who was elected for his racist views and anti-black ideals.

Then we begin to see the break up of black familes; bonus money from the government to be a single mother with children from multiple father's, but only if that father does not live with them.

I'm still not seeing a switch in the parties.  Seems like the side that has been keeping black people in this country down pretty much stayed the same.  Seems as if the Republicans didn't change their platform in that regard at all.

Does the author genuinely think Republicans are all speaking in code when talking about issues? As if our stances aren‚Äôt real, but they mean more nefarious things? Now I am not denying the southern strategy. I clicked the reference on Wikipedia and listened to the video. It exists as a concept and literal thing. However, the ideals of cutting taxes and government spending goes back decades prior to the southern strategy. Many states went Republican on the national level in the 80s and 90s, BUT still stayed Democratic majorities on the state and municipal level till 2000. For example, South Carolina had Democratic majorities in the state legislature until the year 2000 when local politics started to grasp with the times. This was the same in many other southern states. Second, the post doesn‚Äôt talk about any of the fiscally conservative members of the party prior to the 70s and 80s. Barry Goldwater? Robert Taft? What about the rivalry between Theodore Roosevelt and Howard Taft? Calvin Coolidge? What about the rivalry between Robert Taft and Thomas Dewey? These are important things to talk about. These men led the foundations for what the Republican Party to be what it is today. The party has always been a battle of liberal (I say liberal because Theodore Roosevelt ‚Äúprogressivism‚Äù is different than modern day progressivism. I don‚Äôt want those being intertwined) vs conservative. Third, there‚Äôs no mention of the cultural battles that did have effect on politics. What about second wave feminism of the 1960s-1980s? What about the sexual liberation movement? What about the traditionalist movement to combat feminism and sexual ‚Äúliberation‚Äù? Religious folks moving into the party had a major effect as well. Fourth, many of the pro-war hawkish voters of the Democratic Party left and joined the Republican Party. The Vietnam War was heavily crucified by the cultural left at the time. There are many factors to go over other than the southern strategy. Blacks both in the north and south voted majority for Democrats since the 1930s. Whites mostly flipped on sides throughout the 20th century until 1976. Five, I just want to express that the southern strategy is pretty dumb.

Can you provide me with specific examples of Democratic leaders blaming Republicans for the failings, economic, social, or cultural, of cities like San Francisco, Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, etc.?

The systemic problems in Detroit, Chicago, and Baltimore (three commonly cited cities with a sizable African-American presence and a solidly blue electorate) are frequently brought up to lambaste liberal politicians for their failed urban policies.

Also, why are you overlooking poor rural communities that routinely vote red?

Here's a really informative non-partisan article that talks specifically about homicide rates: [Homicide Rates Are Spiking in Major Cities Run by Both Democrats And Republicans](https://www.thetrace.org/2016/11/homicide-rates-spike-major-cities-democrat-republican-mayors/)

Excerpt: *""Historically, both parties have failed at addressing the urban violence epidemic, Fortner¬†says. During the post Civil Rights era, both left-wing and right-wing candidates ran on tough-on-crime platforms by using the dramatic increase in violence and homicides ‚Äì particularly in communities of color ‚Äì to woo middle-class and working-class white voters.""*

Moreover, [at least 11 House Republicans represent large cities with murder rates even higher than Chicago‚Äôs.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/deadliest-cities-gun-control-laws-congress-chicago)

As you probably expected, I disagree with some of it. I'll explain my thoughts with a bit of context, but first the line at the end,  ""The difference explains why both sides can¬†claim the mantle of¬†equal opportunity yet¬†be talking right past one another"" explains a huge amount of the problem in american politics, in my opinion. It's turned into a team sport instead of good governance. Each team has a distorted view of the other. This leads to a couple issues: When you say one thing I hear something different, and when I make an argument, you argue against the distorted version of it that your team has fed you (I don't actually mean you and I specifically. In my experience, democrats and republicans fit equally well on both sides of both points). It makes it hard to have a productive conversation about what actually constitutes good governance.

Now for the disagreements.

>*If men were born in need of crutches, instead of having legs, the fact would be otherwise. We should then be in need of help, and would require outside aide*

I think this is almost the core difference in opinion, and most of my disagreement with the entire article stems from this one point. My understanding of democrat ideology is that due to the history of slavery and racism in this country, being born black in america *is* analogous to being born in need of crutches in a world where men have legs. For example, racist individuals objectively exist. Racism in any given individual may present as overt hatred OR as a milder and more subtle subconscious bias. I'll continue this with an example of a bias towards hiring someone who looks like them over an equally qualified person who looks different. I don't have statistics to prove this and I present it as my opinion, but due to black american history and all that entails, I suspect that is more prevalent in the case of white individuals hiring other white individuals over equally qualified black individuals and I submit that as one of many reasons why democrats believe they should provide ""outside aide"". We can even ignore that point as opinion and conjecture because I don't have any source to back it up. For the sake of fair argument, lets assume that skin color has no correlation to hiring bias. Due purely to the fact that there are more white people in america than any other race, there are more white people in hiring positions so black people are more likely than their white peers to be victims of that subconscious hiring bias. Democrats view this as inequality of opportunity as it is purely an effect of race and racial bias.

>Utilizing government to equalize groups contradicts the proposition that everyone is equal before the law and possesses equal rights: How can resources be directed toward those with less without implying that they‚Äôre different before the law and in the rights they possess?  
>  
>This worldview by definition cannot ever be satisfied, because, short of socialism, there will always be individuals who own and command more resources than the rest.

I understand this point but I think it neglects one factor that is core to the democrat position. Democrats believe that race should not be a factor in who owns and commands more resources than the rest, and they believe that in america today, race is in fact a factor. Many black individuals are just as wealthy as any white person, but democrats believe that racism (even the mild, subtle, subconscious bias variety) makes it more difficult for black individuals to attain that wealth, and that difficulty is an example of inequality of opportunity due to race.

>Furthermore, equality of opportunity encompasses much more than mere economic condition. Consider natural athletic talent, intelligence, work ethic‚Äîare we going to handicap the most talented athletes, dumb down the most intelligent people, and restrain the hardest workers?

I take issue with this at it's core. This comes off to me as a strawman attack and a false equivalency. It relates to personal ability, not opportunity. Race is not a measure of personal ability. Athletic talent, intelligence, and work ethic are. Since this entire article is a comparison the right's and the left's idea of equality of opportunity, this statement subtly implies that the left want this. It's intellectually dishonest at best. Fortunately, this is the only thing in the article that I see as more than just a difference of opinion, and I tried to avoid letting it color my opinion of the rest of the article. 

Overall, I thought that was a reasonable article and I appreciate the link. I did disagree with some of the conclusions, but with the exception of the segment about personal ability, the disagreements were simply a difference of opinion and a difference that I respect. 

I do align with the democrat viewpoint I laid out above, but that was the best way I could find to present it as a viewpoint rather than opinion stated as fact.

Also I agree that there's a lot more nuance as you mentioned, but I admit I'm largely not informed enough to really go into them.

I do want to add that I appreciate that you commented in good faith, but it's really disheartening that you felt the need to say "" Remember to not attack the source, give me your opinion on what is stated"". That's not a statement about you, but that it's not considered the default expectation anymore. Same goes for me feeling the need in my original comment to carefully word it to avoid personal attacks and being dismissed offhand simply because I lean left. Politics isn't civil anymore, and it's a damn shame."

16069,hbzn0f,He didn‚Äôt respond because he can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the truth

16074,hbzn0f,Thanks. It‚Äôs all good.
16075,hbzn0f,"While I will agree that some schools use the money to line their pockets that's usually coming from school not in big cities. Detroit schools, inner NYC school and other schools like that just simply dont receive the funding they need"
16076,hbzn0f,"What do you count as Southern? Texas received $26B, Florida $23B, Virginia $17B. When you compare states you should really look at net federal funding per resident anyways. Going off of absolute values received is disingenuous. California was at $12 per resident while Virignia is at $10k. New Jersey is -$2,368."
16077,hbzn0f,"Since when? Nobody in lower class families support De'vos because she constantly defunds public schools to give to private schools that no middle class family could afford.

16087,hbzn0f,"See that's the wonder of it all, you can disagree with the points but understand the meaning, if you get me. I wish most of us could remember one thing, we are all in this together, we live in the same places, we eat the same food, we breathe the same air and bleed the same red blood. In the end all that really matters is that you tried to live the best you could, for you and your fellow man. The paths may be different, you and I would not see eye to eye on everything for instance but in the end I most likely would still break bread with you. 

I agree it sucks that I had to state the warnings and such, it is a sad state where we are now. I think a major problem has been the rise of sites like Reddit that create the echo chambers on both sides, social media and the main stream media I look at as threats to our very way of life. They were great for information and keeping in touch with family at the beginning but now they are more manipulative. Also got to remember that Twitter, Reddit and Facebook is just a small fraction of the whole population of the US or World. It gets more twisted in here than out there. 

I wish you the very best on your travels through life, always try to keep an open mind and don't let echo chambers cloud your mind. I could use this advice a bit more myself sometimes."

16091,hbzn0f,"Again money is not the issue.  We educated americans 50 years ago with much less than we have now.  The problem is the culture of the black community.  Emphasis on quick money and spending it quickly on clothes and shoes and chains.  Not valuing education, investing, and following the law.  

80% of NFL players go bankrupt.  Well about 80% of them are black.  They buy bentleys instead of investing.  They should be investing in their communities and growing their wealth so that they can make actual change in their community.  Instead they squander every legitimate opportunity.

Yes I‚Äôm typing in sweeping generalizations, but I understand this isn‚Äôt all black people.  But It is definitely the predominant mindset of young people in these communities, and by the time they wise up it is far too late."
16092,hbzn0f,"Oh, democrat run cities failing to meet the basic needs of Americans because they are misguided on proper solutions and fiscally irresponsible? Hmmm I wonder where we can find a model on how to run a state that is at least a huge improvement.  Florida."
16093,hbzn0f,"I have linked in another comment the support that school choice has among poc. Devos supports school choice. Im sorry you can't see past your white privilege, and or socioeconomic privilege."

Of course its important to evaluate a source you're spot on. IMO Its more important to evaluate statements. A liar can tell the truth and an honest man can still lie. 

I really hope someone will look at that and tell me what is false about their claims about PragerU. Not just that its false...."

I did no such thing

Your point was implied by your statement ""More Democrats voted against it than Republicans."" and ""Yeah yeah, I have heard it before..."" when presented with the notion that Democrats that voted against moved to the Republican party thereafter."
16102,hbzn0f,Not happening üòÄ.
16103,hbzn0f,That is the government.
16104,hbzn0f,"Actually in Camden a big portion was a corrupt police force, government and education system. They dismantled the police force and the state stepped in to manage the schools systems. Steps were created to put money into the community and relationship building with the town.  Business and contractors also have built apartments and moved factories there. Crime rate has dramatically decreased and graduation rates have increased. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to say black culture is to blame."
16105,hbzn0f,"PFFFT please tell me you're joking? Florida is quite possibly the biggest failure of a state and the only think keeping it afloat aside the tourism Disney and Miami beach brings in is the hundreds of people who decide to retire there every year because of how cheap it is. Which btw, it's cheap to live there because of how little they have to tax people because of, guess what, federal funding. NYS would be an amazing place to live if Cuomo didn't have to tax tf out of people trying to make up for the lack of funding we should be getting from the federal pot."
16106,hbzn0f,"Yeah they can‚Äôt answer it because it requires creating a real line to distinguish between two different ideologies.

Problem being is the Republicans really haven‚Äôt changed much ideologically speaking. Which makes it impossible to answer."

16167,ih9i4r,Reality is often disappointing

But to me, and to you, a bootlicker is someone who basically is a syncophant for some sort of oppressor attempting to dominate them.  You probably don't think black lives matter is fascistic, trying to control speech, tell people what to do, how to act, what they must believe, threatening them with violence when they don't get their way, but we do.

16217,ih9i4r,Blind BLM and Antifa supporters are licking BLM and Antifa boots.
16218,ih9i4r,"So, sure seems like a lot of BLM signs are being carried when they go loot."
16219,ih9i4r,How exactly are people bootlicking BLM and antifa? Most people generally condemn riots or any sort of violent protests and only support enacting some sort of police reform and trying to combat institutional racism (things like black people being poorer) . And I am still yet to see any real evidence of people supporting antifa at all. As far as I am aware they are more of a spontaneous sort of idea where people are violent but they have no sort of hierarchy like a normal terrorist group (unless you count the Russian bots astroturfing of course).
16220,ih9i4r,"Well yes, but how does this depiction translate to that? And if it does then it isn't making any kind of point except that in any given group there will always be a few that are blindly following.

16224,ih9i4r,So... me calling BLM supporters bootlickers makes me a bootlicker? Got it.
16225,ih9i4r,BLM don‚Äôt wear boots lmao. They wear the kicks they had to loot from foot locker. It‚Äôs okay for them to call republicans boot lickers but when someone calls them the same name people get all butt hurt. Typical.

Imagine 3 dudes pull up to your house with guns, unidentified, and start breaking down your door with a battering ram. Of course the dude starts shooting, wouldn't you? How does that justify shooting a sleeping person? Are cops really so incompetent that it's okay for them to shoot blindly into a house, disregarding human life like that?"

This isn‚Äôt to mention that Taylor helped cover up a murder most likely committed by her drug dealing BF in 2016. 

I would have IDed who was entering the house, and I know I would have because I have done CQB and it was drilled into us. 

There is no evidence they shot blindly into the house.

16392,hkla6k,"Ohh gotchu. Just googled it btw, it's copperplated zinc!"
16393,hkla6k,You are correct.
16394,hkla6k,"Well all the polls I had seen had Trump losing really really bad to Hillary, Bidens polls don‚Äôt seem so far away yet."
16395,hkla6k,We can't judge the election by the polls. I remember seeing that Hillary was gonna win with 99 percent from a poll.
16396,hkla6k,They arent bad now.  There is a big difference between registered voters and likely voters. I think Trump is down 2 in flordia with likely voters.
16397,hkla6k,I agree with you on that. His inconsistency on messages often make me feel like it‚Äôs just better if he doesn‚Äôt say anything at all. He could do well polished mini speeches on his Twitter. Instead we get a 50/50 split of some good calling outs and raging alcoholic tweets.
16398,hkla6k,I just disagree that a few tiny slivers of land (no matter how many individuals live there) shouldn‚Äôt decide the fate of the entire rest of this country. Everyone is entitled to their opinions though
16399,hkla6k,He's also behind in Texas and neck and neck in Georgia.
16400,hkla6k,"We're not talking about land though, we're talking about people. What's wrong with the idea that each vote counts exactly the same?"
16401,hkla6k,"Not among polls of likely voters, just registered voters."
16402,hkla6k,He is NOT behind in TX. Releasing polls that say otherwise is an obvious attempt to demoralize the base. By some of the comments here I can see the tactic (which they tried in 2016) is working.
16403,hkla6k,Because the people in 43 states combined shouldn‚Äôt even bother to vote because one county carries more weight. It‚Äôs a form of voter suppression that our founding fathers wanted to avoid
16404,hkla6k,How does 1 person 1 vote carry more weight? I don‚Äôt see the math when it means everyone gets their say.
16405,ho3dit,No such thing as reverse racism.  Its just racism.

There, I said it.  


\*Update\* - In case anyone is wondering...I am getting messages from people calling me a racist for this very statement.   


Thank you for proving my point. So many of you can't stand the slightest bit of criticism so you call everyone a racist so you don't have to answer for your own actions."
16416,ho3dit,This pisses me off. Just because your black doesn't mean you cant be a racist. Get real this woke shit needs to stop! I blame them for all the civil unrest and all the murders that happened in the dumb ass chop zone.
16417,ho3dit,"Whenever I see this shit I always say ‚ÄúIf I, a white person said I wanted to purge all black people and brutally kill them in a concentration camp because they are subhuman, you would say that‚Äôs racist, but if you, a black person said you wanted to purge all white people and brutally kill them in a concentration camp because they are subhuman, would you say that‚Äôs not racist?‚Äù They always never respond or tell me I‚Äôm ignorant."

16421,ho3dit,"If a women were to rape a man, would it be called reverse rape? No, it‚Äôs just rape. 

Reverse racism is a silly concept. Regardless of race, assigning a value to a groups capacity or ability based off their innate physical characteristics is the very definition of racism. 

Ultimately, in this globalized capitalist world, virtually everyone harbors some form of racist thought - consciously or subconsciously."
16422,ho3dit,The left is so racist that even their definition of racism is racist.
16423,ho3dit,"i keep seeing garbage like this and other dumb stuff all over instagram, especially on people‚Äôs stories who i know. it‚Äôs so sad people actually think like this. there was another post about ‚Äúwhat whites people say and why it‚Äôs a problem‚Äù and one of the things was ‚Äúnot all cops are bad‚Äù like really guys"

16427,ho3dit,The entire premise of the phrase ‚Äúreverse racism‚Äù is racist
16428,ho3dit,"It‚Äôs not even reverse racism, Democrats are fine with any white liberals, but a black conservative, not really black.  It‚Äôs the same political tension that there is every election year, but the democrats disguised it as a race war."
16429,ho3dit,"The left changing the definition of racism to fit the narrative, typical."
16430,ho3dit,Life must be pretty simple if you can blame all your problems on white people.

Also, anyone who owns a property can refuse to rent it to you just because you aren't Japanese. If that isn't straight up systemic racism, then I don't know what is. Reverse racism is just racism."
16444,ho3dit,This is kind of off topic but someone told me black on crime doesn't exist
16445,ho3dit,So according to this person people of color can‚Äôt have ‚Äúpower + prejudice‚Äù?  I work with a guy who believes this is the definition of racism. Yet he is super racist towards white people.
16446,ho3dit,"no no they're right. Reverse racism doesn't exist, but racism does and anyone can be racist, including black people. It's hard for me, a person of color, to fully get behind this movement because of things like this."
16447,ho3dit,Is being white no longer a race?
16448,ho3dit,It does exist. Also you can be racist against people of your own race. The black race is full of racism against dark skinned black women.
16449,ho3dit,Black guy called me a cracker. Is that not racist of him to assume just because I'm white I whipped slaves?
16450,ho3dit,Did anyone see the comment where someone said they were bullied for being white because they went to a black school. They made the white kid pay a toll for walking in the corridors. And the replies to the comments were saying that wasnt racist

Pure racism."
16456,ho3dit,"‚ÄúReverse racism‚Äù as a term assumes that there is a default racism depending on who is the offender and who is the victim. Here they‚Äôre saying that can‚Äôt exist - not because a person of any race can be racist against any other race, which is what a sane person believes, but because the superior race cannot be the victim of racism from the inferior race."
16457,ho3dit,"So you cannot be racist to someone with power. So why the hell was our country called racist for 8years when we complained about the horrible Obama policies, a black person had the most power in the country, we therefore could not have been racist towards him even if we wanted to."
16458,ho3dit,You know the term reverse racism is just another form of manipulation. It enforces their claim that you can't be racist to a white person which is why it gets it's own invented term.
16459,ho3dit,The Left thinks they can redefine racism to suit there own needs.  Isn't the ability to redefine words everyone uses and understands power?  So they have power and they have prejudice so is this chick admitting she's racist?
16460,ho3dit,The issue here is that they‚Äôve changed the definition of racism. Look in the comments. Prejudice + power = racism. They believe white people have rigged the system so they are the only ones in power therefore regardless of prejudice whites are the only ones CAPABLE of being racist. Which is racist in and of itself in several ways

16464,ho3dit,"Honest question:

They say you can‚Äôt be racist against whites because whites are in power. So if we give black people the power not to ever be racist against whites, doesn‚Äôt that make whites the powerless ones? If that‚Äôs true, doesn‚Äôt it therefore follow that it‚Äôs impossible to be racist to a black person?

Do they ever think about these loopholes or is it just me..?"
16465,ho3dit,"They‚Äôre attempting to justify hate crimes and prejudices against White people by gatekeeping the only relavant terms with any weight to it.

It is a selfish, hateful way to control the narrative by manipulating the very way we speak."
16466,ho3dit,"How is it racist for someone to disagree with someone else but it's not racist to say ""every African American that supports Donald Trump isn't black"" is not racist"
16467,ho3dit,According  to the idea that racism is prejudice + power (which I would argue is false) that should mean that when Obama was president whites could not be racist.

16469,ho3dit,"Agree with first half, vehemently disagree with second"
16470,ho3dit,The fact people can say this with a straight face and not see the irony is frightening.
16471,ho3dit,"Forewarning, I‚Äôm a liberal.

But, in general, the reason people say ‚Äúreverse racism does not exist‚Äù is because they have changed the definition of racism. What the mean by racism is: the systemic prejudice and oppression of a particular group based on race, or at least something like that. You can find this in the big group of people who circulate books like White Fragility around. It‚Äôs a changing of the definition and it‚Äôs wrong. Not only is it wrong it‚Äôs also patently bad optics for liberals being against racism. Just like defund the police is a terrible line, saying it‚Äôs impossible to be racist to white people is moronic. The racism everyone thinks of is the Merriam-Webster definition of racism: prejudice based on race. In that regard racism against whites is alive and well within some parts of America, and to deny such is to alienate some members of said white group, at the expense of being a flawed and unhelpful ally.

Long story short, racism is a omnidirectional street and doesn‚Äôt only work one way. Systemic prejudice, I believe, exists, and I believe the evidence supports me in that regard, but to say that just general racism can‚Äôt happen to white people is dumb and counterproductive to having a real, much needed conversation in this country about its history and future."
16472,ho3dit,"You can't just change the definition of a word and then claim victory. Not to mention, it doesn't even make sense in the context of their new definition. There are plenty of black people who have more power and privilege than me. Willow Smith is the daughter of 2 famous multi-millionaires. She certainly has more power and privilege so does that mean she is ""capable"" of being racist? Their stupid definition doesn't hold up to even basic scrutiny"
16473,ho3dit,"The debate about the semantics of the word ""racism"" is not one that's worth having with anyone.  Treating someone differently because of their race makes you an asshole.  

""Racism"" meaning discrimination from a position of power, I mean, I get it.  It doesn't really apply in all situations because positions of power aren't constant in all situations.  At a night club, the bouncer letting people in has power over everyone in the line, regardless of anyone's race.  The next day that situation may flip and someone else has some kind of power over the bouncer.

What they're talking about when they say ""systematic"" or institutional racism is different.  Redlining, Jim Crow, police profiling, etc, is discrimination that is normalized and justified by the majority of society and are examples of institutional racism.

Not all racism is systemic/institutional racism"
16474,ho3dit,"This is why it's important to define your terms. 

I've seen this argument kicked around and it's usually because the writer/speaker has made a delineation between the words ""racist"" and ""prejudice"" without telling anyone."
16475,ho3dit,"We can agree, but the liberals won‚Äôt agree. They say that because white people are privileged, it‚Äôs impossible to be racist toward them."
16476,ho3dit,It‚Äôs quite funny to see people who are so against the idea of white supremacy that they give the entire white race the power to never be a victim of racism. How fortunate for us! Thank you!
16477,ho3dit,"I never say there are loads of white people facing racism currently, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt happen. Just because it‚Äôs nowhere near as often as white on black racism or whatever doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt happen. And I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a fair argument"
16478,ho3dit,Did they use Vice as a source?
16479,ho3dit,Yeah! You can be racist to white people and even Wall Jumpers!
16480,ho3dit,"As a white person who has dealt with racists being racist towards whites, reverse racism is not fun if your the victim."

The moment one makes a statement that is unrelated to race solely based on a person's race that is a racist statement.

The moment one discriminates another solely based on race that discrimination is racism

How can you reverse that?? Therefore, reverse racism is impossible to exist.

Some people, uneducated on the matter, were lead to believe that the word racism means a white person applying the above-mentioned definitions against another race, which is utterly equivocated."

16484,ho3dit,"Amazing that these retards don't even know what reverse racism is. It's not racism against white people by non-whites, it is giving other races preferential treatment instead of poor treatment. Instead of saying black people are inferior so we should not treat them like they are equal, which is normal racism, it is saying black people are inferior so we should hold them up so they are equal."

It‚Äôs not corrupt politicians fault and it‚Äôs definitely not a Democratic Party that‚Äôs constantly telling minorities that they are less than other people and telling them that they don‚Äôt have the same privileges that other people have because of the color of their skin. It‚Äôs our fault. If I remember correctly there was another country that was led to believe that a certain race of people were so evil that they gathered them all up and put them in some kind of camps so that they could do away with these evil people. I can‚Äôt seem to remember what country that was though. Maybe that‚Äôs what America wants now though. It certainly is starting to seem that way.

16495,ho3dit,"Yeah I don't get it either, and I'm leftist. Easiest way to get around this argument is use the word ""discrimation"" instead of racism. The left changed the definition of racism recently for some reason, but you can still say discrimination against white people exists."

This idea also implies that all white people vote and they don‚Äôt. So, if the power is being used for equality and to fight racism how can you sit there and still say racism equals prejudice plus power. It would only work if every single white person was absolutely racist, then White people would benefit from the %60 white population but if half that 60% is voting for the interests of social justice than social justice must also be racist because it‚Äôs benefitting from the power that racism, by your definition, gives them, but we know it isn‚Äôt racist, therefore the definition is false."

16532,ho3dit,"Long story short, it depends how you define racism



rac¬∑ism

/ÀàrƒÅÀåsiz…ôm/


noun

prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.

This is the definition. Some people put a lot of weight on that last part and some don't. I'm guessing this person is heavily weighing on the last part. (Trying to explain this briefly) The idea as I understand it is that a minority cannot be racist against white people because they can't marginalize someone who's part of such a disproportionately larger group. I think they also take into account historic racism. 

So, think of an example where there's a society is 90 white people and 10 non white people. If 50% of each of those groups decides they aren't going to hire (or some other oppressive action) outside their race, white people probably aren't even going to notice. However, the non white people are going to have an absolute terrible time.

16538,ho3dit,"Of course any person can racist in their own way.  As a country who prides itself on equality, our job is to root out ""institutional"" or ""systemic"" racism even where it's not codified.  I.e. banks not being as willing to give blacks loans (controlling for all other variables), the police being 3x more likely to use force against blacks (controlling for other variables), people with black sounding names being 50% less likely to get a call back for a job interview (despite the only difference on the resume being the name).  Those are frustrating evidence-based problems of an undercurrent of systemic racism tied to our long history of those kinds of behaviors being the way things are done.

Organizations had clauses in deeds saying not to sell to black people. The federal government funded programs to STERILIZE black men and women. White supremacists burned houses and churches with children in them because they were black. Have you ever been told you were only hired to ‚Äúdiversify‚Äù a company? Do hard statistics show that your race faces higher jail time and more severe judicial punishments because the color of their skin? Have you ever been profiled/pulled over in your own neighborhood and told ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt seem like a place someone like you‚Äù would live? Have your ancestors been enslaved, raped, and tortured because of the color of their skin? On that same note I bet you can trace your ancestry. I can‚Äôt. Not because of lost papers but because the people who made my existence possible weren‚Äôt even viewed as people. I don‚Äôt want to hear ‚Äúslavery ended years ago get over it‚Äù.

Racism is when there is institutional (legal, economic etc) ideologies in practice that lowers the status of a group of people from a particular racial group.

The issue is though that Webster‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been updated to reflect that and almost everybody was taught that racism is discrimination based on race. I think people should have made an entirely new word instead of taking racism and adding to the definition. Any race can absolutely discriminate against other people based on the color of their skin. Not every race holds societal power over another which is a hard idea to face but one I think we all need to look at.

16562,ho3dit,And the definition of racism is far too broad as it is
16563,ho3dit,"The argument is the same reddit is parroting in their new rules. Unless you are in position of power you can't be racist. Or otherwise phrased as you can't be a victim of racism if you are not disadvantaged. 

The left has been on a roll redefining damn near everything they can get their hands on."
16564,ho3dit,"The idea is based on the definition of racism as ""prejudice+power"".  Do you at least agree, that under this definition (even though you disagree with it) only whites *could be* racist?

If not, consider this: Imagine a scenario in which *every* American individual is racist.  Everyone thinks their race is the superior race and that it should be elevated to the detriment of other races.  Whites are 60% of the population and the majority of voters in every State and nationwide - no other race can possibly get a majority of the vote.  Therefore, only whites have the means to implement ""racist"" policy.

It doesn't make your group superior *(necessarily); but from each individual point of view,  it makes your group more appealing to be in.

Oppression is not of a racial trait, it‚Äôs a cultural thing. White is a lot of cultures so it‚Äôs too broad of a term. So, baited we are. The popular Black American culture has offered to many, strong and lively entertainment while assimilated (assimilated into the higher echelons of American society-something that is not particularly a white demographic) Black American peoples have found their way to counteract progress by allowing toxic rhetoric to flourish within the communities they left. 

Systemic oppression is an idea conjured by those in power. 

Indians oppress their women. 
Arabs oppress other Arabs. 
African tribes oppress captured tribes. 
The Brits oppress the Irish. 
Communism oppresses freedoms. 

My point is that it‚Äôs a tool for those in power to stay in power. We just happen to live in a society where white-er man has historically found their solace away from oppression and has looked to make it a refuge of that oppression. It gets veered along the way but that‚Äôs our position as caretakers of the idea: to steer it for the better good."

16654,ho3dit,"> The problem with this theory is that it assumes that only white people are in positions of power. 

No, it illustrates if whites wanted, they could make it so that only white people are in positions of power.  Other races can not.  We only had a black President because enough *whites* voted for him.  

""But that just proves there's no racism!""

No, it proves that minorities can't get ""no racism"" except through whites.  It's evidence of white supremacy.  So they must play the game, not upset us, protest the right way, or else they'll lose our support.  Meanwhile, if enough white people want something changed, they can get it.  If our leadership won't give it, we can change them.

> even in your theory you admitted that being racist and implementing racist policy isn‚Äôt the same thing. 

I admit I confused things by saying ""imagine everyone American is racist"" and ignoring the distinction the ""reverse racism isn't real"" argument is trying to make.  But I think you understand what I mean, which is, in a scenario where everyone votes in the interest of advantaging their own race, only whites could succeed in doing so.  

> The KKK as an example is a small group of individuals that without any use of politics have done plenty of bad racist shit for some time. 

The KKK's ""bad racist shit"", particularly in the early 20th century, was entirely political.  It was terrorism.  And it worked."

The point is white people, collectively, hold power in the United States.  Your scenario illustrates that Blacks can not ""win"" without white support, but whites can ""win"" whatever they want without *any* minority support.  It's just demographics.

""Black people"" means ""all black people"" does it not?  Otherwise you would have said ""some"", right?

Therefore, they *all* want to change the definition...

You propose literally gives only two criteria for racism and there are way more. Being raised by a racist is another one so theoretically the definition Could be prejudice + power + location + family + intelligence + ethnic background = racism this definition that keeps being pushed is just too simple. we don‚Äôt define racism so strictly, the real definition is more broad because the reality is that racist is not that specific, it‚Äôs far more complex than this definition even attempts to acknowledge."

There are a variety of definitions of systemic racism, most (like Sowell) use systemic and institutional interchangeably, but I wouldn't consider them the same thing.  I'm not sure if I would go so far as to say systemic racism exists, though I am always amused at conservative economists and commentators who point to Democrat policies that they argue have harmed Blacks (like welfare) and either suggest or outright claim that keeping blacks subservient and on the ""Democratic plantation"" is the *purpose* of these programs, and then claim systemic racism doesn't exist.

Or in the case of the country I‚Äôm from and live in (Australia) if white people lived in a country for 40+ thousand years, then were invaded, defined as literal animals, have government backed programs with the intention to wipe them out through stealing children from families or the formation of a line of people with guns with orders to shoot on site in Tasmania, would there be people rallying for the rights and reparation of white people?

There are just so many theoretical and hypothetical jumps there that we can‚Äôt possibly know for sure. I mean probably? 


But I would push back against what you write in the last paragraph there, with the idea that being the target of racism implies that someone is inferior or that a group of people who are able to enact racism in a system are superior.
Or at least I push back against the idea that it makes someone or a group of people intrinsically superior, it doesn‚Äôt, it does however provide that group with power, that coupled with their racial and other biases can be used to, deliberately or not, favour people like themselves and disempower and disadvantage people that they are biased against. 


That for me is a major component of the distinction that racism is bias/prejudice + power. Everybody has bias and prejudice, but when that bias is backed by institutional power (how many judges currently are and have been white historically, how many prime ministers and presidents currently are and have been white etc) the context of a that persons bias and prejudice is that for the most part they are backed by the laws and institutions of the country that they live in. In the US (Aus and UK etc) for black people, people of colour, First Nations people, that‚Äôs not the case, they can be biased, prejudiced and crappy, and that can be real unpleasant to come up against, but the system doesn‚Äôt back up those biases, laws haven‚Äôt historically been written that enshrines that implicit or explicit crappiness in law.

The same is true of all former imperialist powers. We should be willing to acknowledge the pain and suffering we caused in the past but we should also accept that much of the wealth and privilege we enjoy today comes from the oppression of other peoples.

There is a simple reality to it - if there are only 2 people in the world and only $2, then for me to be comparatively wealthy and own $2, you must have none. We cannot both have $2. For a person to gain wealth, another must lose it.

Of course many people migrated to the states to escape exactly that oppression and persecution, whether economic or religious/cultural from all around Europe.

Some problems with the facts.  If it was based on race and not credit, then you'd see a lower default rate than with whites.  Instead you see the exact opposite, they default more often (not much, but a bit).

>It so happens that whites were turned down for mortgage loans at a higher rate than Asian Americans, but that fact seldom made it into the newspaper headlines or the political rhetoric. Nor did either the mainstream media or political leaders mention the fact that **black-owned banks turned down black mortgage loan applicants at least as often as white-owned banks did.** 

https://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2010/04/07/race-and-politics-part-ii-n1179360

You're last link is one bad experience and I already quoted Thomas Sowell that black banks refused mortgages with blacks at the same rate as white banks.  If it was harder and required a higher bar to get loans while black, then you'd see a lower default rate but that wasn't the case."

No doubt almost every culture and country has subjugated at one point or oppressed at another. No one is immune as its human nature. To own more than another is not power unless you give it power. Once power is perceived, and conceded to, corruption follows closely without restraint.

Again, Thomas Sowell has the data and blacks were also turned down at a higher rate than others at black banks (He took the data from the Fed).  So the issue is that they are bad lending risks.  I don't see why Thomas Sowell would lie about that, I mean he is black after all (and a personal hero, love his books).

Evidence that they are bad lending risks are that they default 74% more than whites do and they even default a bit higher than Latinos.

Here is another one, but I will state it is older, but I haven't found the statistics to have changed much:

https://www.jstor.org/stable/24887192?seq=1

Literally to discount these facts, you have to say that banks (including black owned ones) are rejecting the good black borrowers and intentionally picking the bad black borrowers to inflate the default rate.  That is a ridiculous assumption, banks are only worried about their bottom line.  Even if they do hate blacks, they love their money, and wouldn't screw over good borrowers to increase the default rate of blacks and thereby cost them money.

The AZ bank one, is evidence of an idiot should should be fired.  Not only did he cost the company money doing business, but also in the lawsuit.  It isn't evidence of a systemic problem.

The article about the complaint that blacks are too often looked upon as a risk for committing Identity Theft, well sorry to break this to you, but they do commit fraud and forgery and counterfeiting at twice the rates of their population.  It sucks to be labeled, I get that, but instead of blaming the banks, blame the ones doing it.

Less than 14% of the US is black, but they are 29.8% of the arrests for fraud and 31.7% of the arrests for Forgery and Counterfeiting.

It is also very clear that the underclass that gets into those programs tend to vote Democrat and it spirals into generational poverty.

16755,ho3dit,"Do you not see the difference between stating that someone's skin color is yellow and calling them ""a yellow""?"
16756,ho3dit,"You are saying that racial profiling is okay, due to overrepresentation in ‚Äústatistics‚Äù. It actually is not okay. It is not justified to have any bias. Why should people be subjected to discrimination simply because of what other people of their race do/have done?"
16757,ho3dit,"You continue to misunderstand me.  

I am saying, if whites wanted to - if they were all of the same mind and opinion - they could use their political power to overturn every anti-racist policy, reinstate Jim Crow, even re-instate slavery.  They could do it all by themselves without a single minority vote.

Your argument is: that's not true because whites haven't done that?

That's not the point.  I am not saying whites do or would ever do this, but they *could*.

White are the (large) majority, they hold the collective power to subjugate other races in the United States.

If you are minority, this is your reality, this is why they argue that the only kind of racism that really matters is that which *can be* institutionalized, and only whites have the ability to perpetrate it."

Still a blue state, but much more libertarian and business friendly."
16761,dvhni1,Can‚Äôt come out as an ‚ÄúR‚Äù word in CA.  Can‚Äôt wear Red hats or put stickers on your car or else vandalized.  Get called racist even though you‚Äôre a minority.  Tolerant non violent left.

16763,dvhni1,"I was talking with a girl and we were going to meet soon.  Everything was going so well and I liked her. I knew she was a Liberal, no surprise, its CA.  

She made a comment about how she hoped the dems could impeach trump and referenced Ukraine so I brought up Uncle Joe.  She responded with ""Joe Biden wasn't the President.  He did nothing wrong???""

She confirmed I was Republican and said ""I don't associate with Trump supporters.""  

I don't understand the people who live in their bubble and avoid people who arent Liberal.   It blows my mind."
16764,dvhni1,"I'm personally a Democrat, with many Republican friends, (I just like to see both sides of everything, thats why I'm here in the first place) and I cannot believe this. To take politics to such a level is completely irrational. I mean, I've disagreed with my friends on many occasions. But I've never thought to bring any sort of harm or anything to them. And what is the point? If you disagree with someone's agenda, then why would you fuel them with dirt on your party? Oh, I want more people to agree with my idea, so let's do all this stupid stuff to make us look like even bigger idiots. Sometimes I wonder how I associate with any political party at all."
16765,dvhni1,"California sounds a lot like northern Virginia. If you're a Republican in northern Virginia, you can't speak your mind without repercussions and hate thrown your way. Unfortunately, our state just turned into an all blue state. Virginia will soon be a miniature California. It's really sucks to be a Republican in Virginia. Sorry, just had to vent a little."

16767,dvhni1,How tolerant. Sorry that you‚Äôve been dealing with it. It‚Äôs very sad has this kind of activity has become so common and socially acceptable. Nobody should have to deal with that type of bullshit.

16771,dvhni1,In the past both Dems and Reps annoyed me but now days its definitely the left. I might not agree with evething on the right but at least they are not bat shit crazy like the left
16772,dvhni1,"Usually when  see Republicans on Facebook, they just meme about Democrats and maybe a few insults. When I see Democrats post, it's a speech of how terrible Republicans are and why they are pieces of shit and a whole slew of things."
16773,dvhni1,"I live in California. I have many ultra liberal friends.  


I do not doubt this happens AT ALL. It is just surprising sometimes because I have mayyyyyybe met 1 or 2 people that were this zealous in their political beliefs to take things that far."
16774,dvhni1,I keep a very low profile in SoCal. I avoid political discussions with people I know and just let my vote do the talking.
16775,dvhni1,It's all good. Just pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
16776,dvhni1,"I am sorry to hear about the treatment you and your family are receiving. Stay safe! If people bring it up I always throw out the law of the 3 unmentionable topics in public. No talk of sex, religion or politics jokingly and try to lighten the mood. Sometimes it works lol! Well anyways, I wanted to right you to try and be of some help after reading your post. I looked into moving to California this past year and after all the research I've done on the subject, I find myself questioning on why I really even wanted to head out west in the 1st place... See here in Erie, PA, there is lots to do and see too! Its all around you just like in Ca! Its just a short drive to Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo and so many other towns and places for a weekend get-a-way or day trips. If you like the outdoors we have the beauty of all 4 seasons here, there are so many hiking trails to explore, creeks for fishing and land for hunting. The best part about living in Erie is that it sits right on Lake Erie! With the breathtaking sunsets and its endless number of beaches! The cost of living is way less and it has lots of schools/colleges. I couldnt afford much out in Ca I come to find out. Living here, one could even afford lakefront property with private beach access, for a fraction of the money.  Again, I am so sorry to hear about you and your family having a hard time with being there. In this State you shouldn't be bullied about your beliefs and traditions. I urge you to at least check it out, worst comes to worst, you can always go back right?"
16777,dvhni1,this is genuinely gut wrenching
16778,dvhni1,Its crazy!!!! A guy I met here basically thinks this way. If you support trump you're a racist... it's like what?! I really want to move out when I can! Maybe to a swing state and help flip it Red just because..
16779,dvhni1,"So sorry for you and the rest of your family..  We literally face harm just wearing a MAGA hat to the grocery store.  We‚Äôll beat them again and they‚Äôll still be screaming into the sky and petting their baby llamas, for years to come."
16780,dvhni1,"Honestly this is so sad. And I guarantee you people were commenting on this, calling him either a baby for tweeting this, or a nazi."

16783,dvhni1,"Move to Nebraska.  Not to Omaha, Lincoln, Lexington, Scottsbluff, or Schuyler though.  GI, Bellevue, North Platte maybe.  Only certain parts.  Chadron, Hastings, Kearney, Beatrice, Columbus, Fremont, and Norfolk yes, absolutely."
16784,dvhni1,The orwellian puppet-master dems have got the sheeple dems trained well.
16785,dvhni1,I mean the whole country *HATES* California so I wouldn't be surprised this is their way of coping. It's their safe space hahaha
16786,dvhni1,Move man
16787,dvhni1,What a snowflake!
16788,dvhni1,So fucked up
16789,dvhni1,"I drove around the Bay Area all summer in 2004 with a Bush/Cheney sticker on my truck and no one bothered me, but I did have to intervene to protect a woman in San Rafael with the same sticker from a crazed Kerry voter who was about to assault her. I threw him in a dumpster."

16793,dvhni1,None of that behavior strikes me as particularly fascistic. It fulfills many qualities of it but appears to lack nationalism. It looks more like aggressive tribalism than an attitude of fascism.
16794,dvhni1,Maybe this says more about how awful Republicans have become lately if coming out as one can give you this much hatred
16795,dvhni1,I have to resist the image of running cars with CA plates off the road because some may be good political refugees and not locusts.

16810,dvhni1,well the good thing is you probably wud never want to  be with a person like that in the first place lol
16811,dvhni1,"Eh, core political beliefs are pretty important considerations for a relationship. It makes a lot of sense to avoid a relationship with someone if you know for a fact you can‚Äôt abide by their beliefs."

16814,dvhni1,"No way, you‚Äôre way off. You don‚Äôt have to actively participate in politics to receive this kind of abuse. Especially in California. Most of my big clients are die hard liberals. They‚Äôre constantly attempting to lure me into a discussion, and they‚Äôd fire me in an instant if I vocalized my thoughts. 

California is legitimately surrounded by an iron curtain of ideology."
16815,dvhni1,"I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs true, we put Trump 2016 sign in our yard for a couple of weeks before the election and we‚Äôre still being vandalized..  Nobody should have to hide their beliefs or face hatred."
16816,dvhni1,"I am from Chicago who recently moved to Colorado springs 75% of the time. I also have been going to California A LOT due to work. A lot of work there because of the recent law which upped the vandalism/theft amount for a felony up to $950. I install security shutters.

I have talked to,many californians and many say they want to get out and are very pissed off at the state. Like you said is the same thing they said. It is going to shit."
16817,dvhni1,Oh. Then you must know one of my neighbors.
16818,dvhni1,Calezeula is forming now.
16819,dvhni1,I wish.
16820,dvhni1,I‚Äôm guessing the first few cities you mentioned are more urban/developed? And the others are a bit more suburban/rural?

16822,dvhni1,"yup, doxxing is necessary"
16823,dvhni1,Worst thing about being a Californian  for me is when I'm finally able to flee I'll have to explain to everyone how I'm a God fearing conservative and not a demonic crazed socialist. Though most people are gracious and I'm sure I'll do fine.
16824,dvhni1,I'd just like to reflect that you are talking about driving people off the road based on their political affiliation under a post about someone being harassed for their political affiliation.
16825,dvhni1,Same.
16826,dvhni1,You got problems.
16827,dvhni1,Please do. Of course I got it somewhere else too.

16851,dvhni1,"Yup. I'm born & raised in Jersey in a shithole ghetto. It's getting worse everyday because of illegals pouring in. I lived in a sanctuary city & was surrounded by them.
I'm used to crime but it's getting worse from illegal criminals flooding the area in droves. 

We had an opportunity to move to the Midwest & took it. I'm trying to get my mother, sister & niece to come.

As long as we keep it to ourselves it‚Äôs usually ok. But people can sense when you disagree with them, and many bait and attempt to unearth an opposing view. And if you actually volunteer information, it can be detrimental"
16856,dvhni1,"Straight up! I‚Äôm as white as they come but now thankfully from the Midwest, everything is so much better out here. I am an American, regardless of your skin color if you are born in this country you‚Äôre an American too. Democrats like to tell minorities how to vote and to minimize their identity by making it only about race, it‚Äôs insanity to me. Coming from Ca over run by illegals was absolutely terrible, not because they‚Äôre brown like the Demos would say, but because they aren‚Äôt American."

16858,dvhni1,"Just using the fact that if people come forward and say what they believe in, and are then persecuted for their beliefs, wether it‚Äôs coming out as a Republican or coming out as gay, people need to let people live the lives they choose, with no judgement!"
16859,dvhni1,[removed]
16860,dvhni1,"Alright, but I think there's an issue here. Going with the example thaf Trump is against gay marraige, isn't supporting a Republican system in effect persecuting gay people?

16861,iyhic1,"I like Candace Owens and I don‚Äôt like BLM. But stop blaming shit on white men. I understand the tactic, but as a white guy, fucking stop it.

16862,iyhic1,"Hello oh so kind and gentle folks of this sub, I am a (please read the whole comment, then downvote) democrat that would like to make a clarification for y'all 
I support ""Black Lives Matter"" the saying because I'm not fucking racist, however
I do not support ""Black Lives Matter"" the organization because they are fucking racist and borderline psychopathic

You can support one without supporting the other, it's kinda simple, like being a democrat and not being able to support Joe Biden."
16863,iyhic1,[deleted]
16864,iyhic1,I contend BLM has violated RICO Act on several occasions. Extortion is the least of their crimes. Never forget - at the onset of their ‚Äòpeaceful protests‚Äô they demanded reparations. To the tune of - 14 trillion dollars was it? Or they would ‚Äòburn the whole system down‚Äô or other escalations in violence against the American people.
16865,iyhic1,"How do people sleep at night supporting this bullshit. My leftist relatives and friends now know BLM is evil. Now they ask people do you support black lives matter and not the organization lmfao 
I tell them I support all people and I would never care about a particular race more than another. That would be racist.... Dems act like it‚Äôs the 1800‚Äôs or something when it comes to race and they wonder why they won‚Äôt stand a chance in November"
16866,iyhic1,"It is supported by the CCP if you look the website and the history of their founders 
It talk on how they were studying and teach market ideals."

click donate on BLM page, read the fine print. Actblue takes the donation. Actblue is a super pac. 
Go to opensecrets.org and search for BLM. (won't find much if anything)
Now search in opensecrets actblue. 
You can see the tens millions that went to every single Democrat politican. Most were white. 

BLM is a front for Democrat fundraising. Even more specific marxist politics."
16868,iyhic1,"Except for its founded by 3 women of color, but sure its somehow white people's fault."

16882,iyhic1,"She isn‚Äôt blaming white people, she is announcing the hypocrisy of their actions."
16883,iyhic1,True. Although BLM is filled with white communists
16884,iyhic1,"Yeah I agree with her on a lot of stuff she says about the issues we have.

But I agree, the generalization ruins whatever message was intended."
16885,iyhic1,"She‚Äôs not saying it‚Äôs racist for white people to protest black issues, she‚Äôs saying that it‚Äôs not even the black people out protesting. She‚Äôs talking about people with white savior complex."
16886,iyhic1,Thank you for being one of the few sane democrats during this time. It's honestly appalling how many people are bandwagoning this filth.
16887,iyhic1,"Do you support decoupling them?

Do you believe the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has damaged the saying Black Lives Matter?"
16888,iyhic1,Why would you deserve a downvote? That seems like a pretty rational thing to say
16889,iyhic1,"Winner, winner, free-range and humanely raised chicken dinner!

I think it should differentiated between the organization and the movement this way:

The organization - Black Lives Matter

The belief - Black lives matter."
16890,iyhic1,source?
16891,iyhic1,"That seems to be the flavor lately with the left given Bloomberg paying off the restitution and fines of 32,000 felons. 

I guess the newest disparate tactic of the left."
16892,iyhic1,"Wow that‚Äôs actually one of the very few times I‚Äôve ever heard a leftist speak some common sense. 

It‚Äôs good to know there are some of you guys out there.

As far as the organization and the ‚Äòmovement‚Äô being two separate things; one hand washes the other. One doesn‚Äôt benefit without the other benefitting. 

They have become one and the same unfortunately. The ‚Äòmovement‚Äô needs to rename itself and break away from the terrible organization. 

I don‚Äôt believe for a second the original movement had Marxism and the destruction of the nuclear family as its ideals. The organization has rotted what BLM meant to people originally right out."
16893,iyhic1,"They act as if black lives don‚Äôt matter to most people when generally, they do and most people agree with the statement. 

I support black lives just as much as I support the lives of white people, Hispanic people, Asian people and everyone else as long as they are decent human beings. 

Skin color doesn‚Äôt matter. If you‚Äôre black, white, rich, poor, gay, straight, transgender, whatever. If you‚Äôre a decent and/or productive human being, your life matters to me and most of society agrees with that."
16894,iyhic1,"I actually just threw up a [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/walkaway/comments/iyd3hv/blm_a_chinese_front/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) discussing this issue today. 

The guy in the video is very credible, he‚Äôs been covering the Chinese communist party and news from inside China for years.

He‚Äôs no right wing hack, he legitimately has the niche of following Chinese related news."

16902,iyhic1,"I'm not OP, but another democrat who shares OP's sentiment. To answer your question: Yes. BLM Global Network has done a lot of damage to the movement, they are not at all transparent with their funding and expenditures, they are incredibly negligent in the way they have not used their platform, media attention, and funding to talk about real legislateable reform to law enforcement. I could go on and on. They're a shit organization and I think the movement should adopt another slogan to distance itself from the group."
16903,iyhic1,I know I alway watch him
16904,iyhic1,Thank you Mr bot. I didn't want to link because I'm always leary of clicking them.
16905,iyhic1,Have you actually looked into the execs and leaders of BLM such as Susan Rosenberg they're actually marxists without any exaggeration. Obviously not every member is but almost the entire inner circle is open about it.
16906,iyhic1,"Of course saying good. It was designed that way. That's like the KKK rebranding themselves as ""don't kick puppies"". If you disagree with them you are a puppy violence advocate."
16907,iyhic1,I can respect that.
16908,iyhic1,Source?
16909,iyhic1,"Not necessarily, you can say kkk bad but still advocate for not kicking puppies. It's alright for you to support a message without supporting the main people that say it"

16912,ivuge4,"This shouldn't be a controversial statement. Love thy neighbor, it's really that simple."
16913,ivuge4,"I love Caity Lotz. She's so great in legends of tomorrow. It's not often you see bi characters on screen. They're either gay or straight. 

There's more gay conservatives than you'd think. The republican party really ought to make envoys into the gay community arguing for 2A rights and economic policy that supports small business."
16914,ivuge4,"I tend to find more hatred from the left. I'm usually cautious about expressing my respect for our president, yet the left screams it at the top of their lungs. Never have I though about damaging personal property because of my views but have watched numerous times my neighbors flags and signs ripped off their property for supporting Trump. I won't put a bumper sticker up because I can't afford to fix the damage to my truck. WE ARE THE SILENT MAJORITY."
16915,ivuge4,"People have a tendency to forget that you can be gay and a conservative, it's not some forbidden thing to be both."
16916,ivuge4,"The left is all about tolerance and equality! Until you disagree with them, then you‚Äôre a terrible racist bigot who should burn in hell. 

Tolerance is not ‚Äúbelieve what I believe or else you‚Äôre a shitty person‚Äù but unfortunately, that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve turned it into."
16917,ivuge4,"Legit some of the nicest and open people I know are Trump supporters. As a Hispanic, I can tell you that liberals are way more racist and hateful to me than Trump Supporters. They say shit like ‚Äútrump doesn‚Äôt like you‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a traitor‚Äù. They even call me slurs. While I have never once had a racist experience with any Trump supporters."
16918,ivuge4,"Guys come hate on me, I'm gay"
16919,ivuge4,Most of us have LGBTQ+ people in our families and we certainly don't want them to die or have restricted rights.
16920,ivuge4,"Your right, white people have never felt hopeless or unwanted in their entire life. It‚Äôs always awesome for us. /s"
16921,ivuge4,"This is obviously true. Unfortunately, the left tends to think that people on the right must be evil for believing something different than they do. Look at the pure hate and hostility on r/politics for example. Meanwhile, I legitimately haven't seen one disrespectful comment towards RBG. That's because while people on the right disagree with her vehemently, they don't think she's a bad person, just misguided."
16922,ivuge4,Hmmm.....looks like I need to start following Caity Lotz
16923,ivuge4,"They think more than half the country wants to murder them, imagine being this paranoid holy shit."
16924,ivuge4,Since the left hates everyone they just assume everyone is like them.
16925,ivuge4,"Coming up next: Caity Lotz get CANCELLED for not hating Trump voters, CW fires another arrowverse actor."
16926,ivuge4,"I‚Äôve said before and I will say it again, of Joe Biden gets elected president of the United States I may not like it but I would still respect and his position in the US government"
16927,ivuge4,"It's alarming how brainwashed the Left has become.  Apparently, they have never spoken to a conservative before.  They are in a bubble, and project their unfounded hatred onto people who don't deserve it.  

Perhaps, it's the current state of our education system, or the fact that all of media, music, TV, social media is overwhelmingly left.  Conservatives, on the other hand, tend to better understand ""progressive"" views and arguments because we see it everyday.  Generally speaking, we are welcoming to those who wish to learn more about our views."
16928,ivuge4,Most of you may not know this but she is a bi actor acting in a show called DC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow. I just went over to the subreddit of the show and oh boy those nasty leftist are showing their true colors
16929,ivuge4,"She might be surprised at how many people hate her existence on the other side too, just for different reasons."
16930,ivuge4,"You know from what ive seen, ive determined one crucial thing. Republicans are happier. Yeah we see things we want fixed, and we get frustrated, but we choose to be happy.

The Left is taught to be miserable and that its someone elses fault. Th Right says we're all blessed to be Americans and we can do anything.

Food for thought."
16931,ivuge4,"I hate people pretending their shit don't stink. The right and the left, both, have spiteful and hateful people. Don't pretend otherwise. They are also both full of kind and gracious people, don't pretend otherwise.

There are people in support of conservative policies that are very hateful. Planned parenthood has had people shoot their doctors, and the general vitriol towards the ""gay agenda"" doesn't exclude hateful screams in the streets. Q-anon is  harboring a vast conspiracy theory to justify angst and violence. Ethnonationalist vocally favor the POTUS as a useful patsy and each year the US has seen more hate crimes and infiltration of institutions directly opposed to it but insufficiently able to catch all of these bad actors (see hearings with DoD leadership from august 2019 and Feb 2020). It does no good to not recognize this. It is far more peaceful and a step in the right direction to acknowledge these unsavory elements for the deep rooted problems they are.

That said, it is very much worth separating ""attitude"" from ""policy"". Policy that harms the interest, especially when it particularly declares a group undeserving of consideration, can be perceived as hateful. It specifically meets the broader definition of hate, which is not marked by strong emotion, but callousness. It is insufficient to say, ""this policy matches my morals so the harm to you isn't real."" That callousness is a problem worth inciting ire against us. 

Finally, there is the deep rooted cynicism the GOP has engaged in since Obama. Disinformation campaigns against the ACA, mislabeling it, drumming up ill-informed disapproval, are not only a waste of resources, but directly harm people, and hinder productive policy discussions. It does not breed healthy relationships, between politicians or citizens. A perception of hate is a natural antecedent of those poor relationships.

PS I really don't like Mitch."
16932,ivuge4,I have no issues with gay people's existence. My only problem is that gay people tend to vote for people who want to ban my guns.
16933,ivuge4,"People on the legends of tomorrow subreddit are freaking out. I am actually surprised. I knew the left was brainwashed but they really are taking things to new heights. This woman is literally just saying we should treat each other with respect and all the lefties are saying no, everyone on the right doesn‚Äôt deserve respect because they ‚Äúdeny my right to exist‚Äù. I have yet to see anyone on the right denying anyone the right to exist. I used to be on the left but woke up a few years ago when I saw how intolerant they were. The right is so accepting of all races, sexual orientations, country of origin, etc. the right doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about anything other than freedom and the wellbeing of other Americans. It‚Äôs the left that wants to take freedoms away just because you may think differently or just for being white. They are racist and closed minded. It makes me sick man. I don‚Äôt know of any Trump supporters who want to murder people simply for being who they are."
16934,ivuge4,"Liberals really don‚Äôt get this, we don‚Äôt hate their existence, they obviously hate our as has been proven. We just don‚Äôt care about their existence as long as they don‚Äôt push it on us."
16935,ivuge4,"I might not agree with caity lotz on everything but she‚Äôs doing the right thing. Everyone should take notes, always be the bigger person even though it‚Äôs easy not to be; especially on the internet"
16936,ivuge4,I always love ‚Äúthey hate my existence‚Äù when almost guaranteed no right winger actually told them that. The media however...
16937,ivuge4,A Biden supporter at a Trump rally will be accepted. A Trump supporter at a Biden rally would be beat up - and the worst part is there‚Äôs thousands at a Trump rally and like seven at a Biden rally.
16938,ivuge4,The white canary speaking the truth.
16939,ivuge4,Don't tolerate the intolerant
16940,ivuge4,I care about that idiots life
16941,ivuge4,"Wow! Caity, I am impressed."
16942,ivuge4,Gee I wonder why so many people hate these types?  Maybe because hatred is all that exists in their hearts?
16943,ivuge4,"Hear me out, what if we... crazy idea... conversate and discuss issues with meaning. Learning to talk is what brings us together."
16944,ivuge4,The only political people I hate are the ones who burn and loot their cities
16945,ivuge4,They really do forget that LGBT people can lean right as well. The left is much more prone to stereotyping and racism than they understand. It's unfortunate.
16946,ivuge4,Absolutely beautiful and totally true.
16947,ivuge4,And this is why I love Sara Lance.
16948,ivuge4,"Who would've thunk a CW star have such a sensible opinion.

I love Caity Lotz lots.

Sad to say she's probably out of further CW shows now :("
16949,ivuge4,I have only ever registered as republican. I have always voted in favor of gay rights since I was old enough to vote. Ask me anything.
16950,ivuge4,You mean how blm hates the existence of white people and anyone who disagrees with them enough to call for a genocide against those people?
16951,ivuge4,"Meanwhile people have been voting for Dem mayors, however much scandal they seem to land just to give a middle finger to everyone else ( see Chicago or Marion Barry in DC) . Then they say MAGA voters will vote Trump to spite everyone else."
16952,ivuge4,"Bruh Caity Lotz plays a bi woman on Legends of Tomorrow. She may be bi irl, but I don‚Äôt know."
16953,ivuge4,I would love to find them and say that they are alright. They need some kind. People to disagree with them.
16954,ivuge4,What the fuck is a cis dude? I‚Äôm so confused right now?
16955,ivuge4,"Can‚Äôt get mad at a person who was tricked and swindled by massive media outlets and corporations that have perfected the art of mass swindling. All you can do is bring love, acceptance, and facts to try and help."
16956,ivuge4,Always thought Caity was a little coo coo. Nice to see shes on the level here.
16957,ivuge4,She can keep her head cooler more than I can.
16958,ivuge4,"Pff, the left really believes WERE the hateful ones. 

Give me a fucking break"
16959,ivuge4,Well it‚Äôs true if she is actually a bot.
16960,ivuge4,"My 93 year old dad and I talked about the contentious times we are going through. We should all have someone in our lives who has this sort of life experience. (Depression, WWII veteran, polio pandemic, etc). He told me he has lived through much worse than what we are experiencing, he said everyone should stay as far away as possible from anyone with extreme viewpoints from either party (those who shout the loudest have the least to say...one of his favorite things to say), and he has utmost faith in our country. He is a proud patriot and I thank God everyday I still have his logical common sense advise."
16961,ivuge4,"imagine thinking this proves your point

she is literally judging them on the content of their character"
16962,ivuge4,Holy shit. This really encapsulates all their rage.
16963,ivuge4,"Those people are fucking delusional. Surprised to see Lotz, someone on the CWverse be this accepting."
16964,ivuge4,In reality the majority of Republicans don't really care if you ever die. we just want to be left alone you live your life will live ours
16965,ivuge4,Based and wholesome pilled
16966,ivuge4,Wholesomely based
16967,ivuge4,she deleted the tweet because of the amount of hate she got because apparently all of the comments were saying people who support trump are against human rights and hate minorities
16968,ivuge4,Laughs in being ineligible to vote
16969,ivuge4,I‚Äôm still trying to find these trump supporters telling everyone we hate everyone.
16970,ivuge4,Y'all aren't like that often on reddit I'll tell you that much lmao
16971,ivuge4,Roasted
16972,ivuge4,She had to delete the post ffs
16973,ivuge4,Honestly republicans are majority not bad people just democrats but nobody can imagine being tolerant and being republican ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
16974,ivuge4,brainwashed
16975,ivuge4,Exactly enough with all the hate and violence. Just talk to one another. Its the key to everything.
16976,ivuge4,"Everyone including us need to try and keep a more open mind, I mean still take everything with a grain of salt but don‚Äôt immediately dismiss everything, it‚Äôs not all black and white especially not now, I‚Äôm not saying we need to necessarily change or accept anything new but the sooner we stop fighting the small things the faster we can move forward as a society and as a species

Edit: just saw last picture and since I‚Äôm a ‚Äústraight white male‚Äù apparently my words mean nothing anymore"
16977,ivuge4,"They‚Äôll be hard to find, though.  That silent majority doesn‚Äôt just advertise with giant red signs on their foreheads or flags outside their houses."
16978,ivuge4,"There's not a more hateful group than the ""inclusive"" left.  
Me as a ""cis and straight and white"" trump voter don't hate Biden voters. I just think they're a bit dumb."
16979,ivuge4,Except they‚Äôre side is actually murdering trump supporters...
16980,ivuge4,"mentally damaged, emotionally incontinent, and physically disfigured. That's the modern left for you."
16981,ivuge4,r/wholesome
16982,ivuge4,She changed her @? I tried to tell her I love her and it was a locked account that said fuck off..
16983,ivuge4,The left has the people killing...
16984,ivuge4,I love the White Canary!
16985,ivuge4,"Hmm I don‚Äôt remember murdering those Democrats who said I should kill my self 

Maybe I‚Äôm just a bad republican but whoever would go outta their way to be so radicalized to hurt people over who‚Äôs in the White House shouldn‚Äôt live in America because in America we‚Äôre allowed to differ our opinions than those of our peers

Also ps I‚Äôm glad, I never wanted that persons love in the first place I‚Äôd imagine hanging out with them to be similar to hanging out with your one friend who‚Äôs always like ‚Äúif we don‚Äôt make a move the whole country is at stake!!‚Äù 

PPSS when did people get so paranoid of others I get the whole they don‚Äôt like the other side thing but Murder is a serious accusation and it‚Äôs one someone shouldn‚Äôt be hypocritical about cause we can easily name a number of leftist who kill right wingers because of who they vote for. Just saying"
16986,ivuge4,RIP Caity Lotz
16987,ivuge4,"The Internet encourages people to say things to other people, under the cover of anonymity/lack of repercussions, that they would never say to someone's face.

And I think the COVID-19 lockdown is amplifying this effect.  I might even go so far as to suggest that's the whole *point* of the lockdown."
16988,ivuge4,What a victim
16989,ivuge4,"Although it‚Äôs hard to love really, really stupid people...."
16990,ivuge4,Intolerance shouldn't be tolerated.  We won a few wars about that.
16991,ivuge4,So it seems straight white people cant be Democrats
16992,ivuge4,"The only people who have ever threatened me or been hateful to me bc of my sexuality were conservative. I know that's not something every Republican does, but it has only come from one group in my entire life.

Add in the fact that some are still openly anti lgbt and still get voted for, and I can't really take claims of being welcome very seriously."
16993,ivuge4,"It‚Äôs true, only Republicans came to protest outside my mosque"
16994,ivuge4,"When I bought my house and met my new neighbor (Republican) he assumed I was republican for some reason and said to me ‚ÄúThe only good democrat is a dead democrat.‚Äù 

His frail 75 year old draft dodging ass is obviously confused because I fought in the Iraq war alongside republicans, democrats, independents, libertarians, black, white, hispanic, asian... All AMERICAN. People like him are the problem in the world. He hangs his confederate flag next to his American Flag. I swear these people are dumber than a bag of hammers."
16995,ivuge4,"I'm always disturbed when someone says ""I hate group x, except you, you are different"" just because they know ""you"". That is just racism/sexism/whateverism but you are too cowardly to say it to someones face."
16996,ivuge4,Now I don't have many in-person experiences with Republicans or Democrats outside my own family and friends but the Republican side is much more hateful and intolerant of people than the Democrat side. Voting for people because they hate gays/blacks. Probably not because they are Republicans moreso because there religious. Just wanted to include my own experiences.
16997,ivuge4,"Republicans are super un civil and their president call everyone horrible immature names.

So guys, this is just laughable."

17004,ivuge4,"I literally just got permabanned from R/askaconservative for asking 2 questions. I tried, it didn‚Äôt work :( I think this one and r/conservative are a bit better though.

Edit: and as you can tell from below, this sub is quite markedly different and thank you for that. I‚Äôm really happy to have this place to talk with more knowledgeable republicans on their policies. It‚Äôs a great and civil place for discourse that I think a lot of lurkers learn from, as well as those that comment like me. So keep it up mod team, been doing good work."
17005,ivuge4,"Pro gay rights? Pro women's rights pro trans rights? Pro atheist rights? The right actively works against these people, so the left has a point, I think.

The Republicans fight for individual rights, which I love. But I wish they would fight for these other groups to be included in the fight for rights."
17006,ivuge4,So u are pro immigration ?
17007,ivuge4,[removed]
17008,ivuge4,I love legends too!! I was horrified to wake up and see all this happening. So ridiculous. I feel for her Bc this was just so uncalled for. They even started a hashtagüòíüòí
17009,ivuge4,[removed]
17010,ivuge4,My sister has converted her gay friends.
17011,ivuge4,"I agree about economic policies. So many in the community own a small business. When I look through the Republican Party it's actually pretty interesting in relation to being gay that many don't even know about. The Pink Pistols, Log Cabin Republicans, Reagan's Briggs Initiative, Bush Sr and GW Bush, Trump administration. These usually seem to fly under the radar for some reason. Most of it has to do with being so mainstream nowadays with celebrities and the media. Even in 2008 though there were debates about hospital visitation and civil unions which I applaud on the republican side for talking about."
17012,ivuge4,Amen to that üôå
17013,ivuge4,"> I won't put a bumper sticker up because I can't afford to fix the damage to my truck.

My husband and I just talked about exactly that this afternoon. We live in the most progressive city in our state; I'd love to put a window cling (bumper stickers are too permanent for me) on my car, but I'm too scared someone would key it or slash my tires or something awful."
17014,ivuge4,"This does not make sense. It literally can't be true.

If you are flying flags, posting signs or billboards, or displaying bumper stickers, you are by definition not silent."
17015,ivuge4,Your cohorts aren‚Äôt silent. And they aren‚Äôt the majority even among just voters.
17016,ivuge4,Recent poll said 45% of gay men are planning to vote for Donald
17017,ivuge4,https://youtu.be/lQ4hYdxMIzY
17018,ivuge4,I tend to believe a lot of the confusion comes from mixing up some of the republican base or Trump base and how Trump or the party as a whole is. It‚Äôs no secret evangelicals voted almost exclusively Trump and will likely do so again. This is a group that has a history of less then progressive ideas when it comes to gay rights and are some of the more vocal about it. Does this make every conservative this way? Or Trump anti-gay? No. But it‚Äôs easy to see how this gets painted.
17019,ivuge4,Voting Republican = Voting against lgbt rights

17022,ivuge4,Not the transgenders though.
17023,ivuge4,"How do you justify voting Republican then? I tend to vote for best candidate, not party line, but with the current trend against women and gays, it is really hard to vote R."
17024,ivuge4,"About RBG, I haven't seen any hate either. Imagine if Kavanaugh died. There would be parades."
17025,ivuge4,Im not even sure r/politics is actually left wingers. I think its mostly filled with foreign trolls.
17026,ivuge4,R/politics makes me physically sick to my stomach
17027,ivuge4,I think it‚Äôs also important to remember that reddit isn‚Äôt a good thing to use as an example of anything to compare to in reality.
17028,ivuge4,RBG was actually more reasonable than the latest identitarian-brand of politics we are getting from that side of the aisle.
17029,ivuge4,Someone has never been to church
17030,ivuge4,Seems like a logical explanation.
17031,ivuge4,Isn‚Äôt the rest of the world much more left than America itself? That‚Äôs probably why most media is left leaning.
17032,ivuge4,"I'd say we have way to many people on both sides that are not tolerant of others views.
We live in a free country and everyone has the right to hold the views they want. 

People need to learn to put themselves in others shoes.
I've run into way to much hatred from both left and right ,it seems were getting to a point where we are viewing Americans who don't agree with us as the enemy instead of just fellow Americans who have a diferent opinion.
I think social media and media in general has a big part to play in this since most people's views aren't being challenged 
(just look at Facebook constantly trying to serve you content you agree with so they can earn more money)
People also need to think critically when watching TV ,if you just pay a little attention you can notice how wording is changed here and there (this is why I don't bother watching Fox, CNN , Msnbc since there all way to biased to be a reliable news source )
I do not agree that conservatives are more tolerant ,at least from what I've seen it's about equal amount of total BS and intolerance from people on both sides sadly.
As for the education system I don't think it's leaning either direction though it is a giant mess and needs to be reformed ,I've run into way to many Americans who think the world revolves around them / the US ,I think this is both a educational and society issue :as far as I know geography and world history are not required in most hight schools and even if there taught it's very minimal 
(school trips outside the US might also help though that is a lot harder to do)
the other part of this I think is people seem to be way to entitled (this doesn't seem to be a recent issue since I see baby boomers douing this alot also) just looking at how little people use turn signals shows this imo (imo using a turn signal is just a common courtesy to others on the road) I think in part is due to this notion of everyone for themselves that we seem to have instead of we are all in this together which imo should be our mentality"

17034,ivuge4,I love the show. I‚Äôm conservative and seeing the subreddit and the twitter replies made me upset Bc she‚Äôs done nothing but good things. She might be more left leaning...but unlike these people I can respect her opinions without having a temper tantrum.

17036,ivuge4,What reasons?
17037,ivuge4,EXACTLY!! Like it doesn‚Äôt matter as long as you don‚Äôt hurt other people or force it on people
17038,ivuge4,"Yeah, people are calling her out for leaving the situation and not apologizing. Which is awesome cause that means she probably actually means it and sticks by what she said"
17039,ivuge4,Respectfully disagree. Both sides would harass each other at a rally. There are videos of it from both sides.
17040,ivuge4,"*so long as they are respectful.* Respect is a give and get system. You give respect, you get respect. I've attempted civil dialogue on campus before, but then third parties always want to but in in the most disrespectful, incurious ways. Needless to say my opinion of them plummeted."
17041,ivuge4,"Wow, got some links?"
17042,ivuge4,Ok?
17043,ivuge4,"Yeah i know. And because of this, the people that like her because she ‚Äúrepresents‚Äù the lgbt community, think she‚Äôs betraying them"
17044,ivuge4,"It's the ""woke"" way. I refuse to use ""woke"" terms. I hate that I'm saying ""woke."""
17045,ivuge4,A fancy way of saying a straight dude
17046,ivuge4,"It means born male/XY and identifying oneself as male, i.e., not transgendered or some other variation.

Edit: I think it's a way of them saying being born XY and considering oneself male is not the standard and everything else is just a variation of that standard. (If that makes sense.)

I don't have a horse in the game but it never hurts to clarify language."
17047,ivuge4,"""Cis"" is short for ""cisgender"" which is the opposite of transgender. 

A cis dude is someone who was born a male and still identifies as a male."
17048,ivuge4,Who?
17049,ivuge4,"If that were true they would be pro choice, pro gay marriage, pro open homosexuality in the military and media, etc.

None of that effects Republicans lives directly, yet it is evidential through policy, protests and votes that this isn't true."
17050,ivuge4,"You are welcome to be a conservative/republican. If anyone gives you any problems for whatever reason, tell them to stay out of your business. And that‚Äôs what the large majority of the right do. They don‚Äôt care what you do in the bed. However there‚Äôs gonna be outliers"
17051,ivuge4,Did they burn it?
17052,ivuge4,Lol!!!!! You have GOT to be kidding.
17053,ivuge4,"Bruh.... I get it‚Äôs a little childish but when you get insulted on a daily basis by basically the entire media, and get told that your the worst thing that‚Äôs ever happened to this country, your gonna wanna call some people names, deservedly of course."

17063,ivuge4,I got banned from ask a conservative because I said that we happen to love all people who want to be conservative.

There was a meme post showing Trump against mail-in voting, then showing that Trump himself does mail-in voting.  

So I made the mistake of simply pointing out that there's two different types of mail-in voting being discussed.  

Trump does Absentee Voting, where a registered voter fills out forms requesting a mail-in ballot be sent to their current and confirmed address.   

The mail in voting everyone is arguing over will mail ballots to every address on record, where people may have died, moved, not planning to vote, etc.   

Bam!  Permaban!"
17066,ivuge4,I got banned for no reason at all.
17067,ivuge4,"I should show you some messages I still have from the r/conservative crowd.  Maybe it‚Äôs the minority, but the ones I encountered are blatantly racist and will bully anyone with an opposing opinion"
17068,ivuge4,What rights do atheists need? Seriously asking. (edited a typo)
17069,ivuge4,"Out of curiosity, what rights do atheists not have?"
17070,ivuge4,[deleted]
17071,ivuge4,Can you list some examples of rights not given to these groups?
17072,ivuge4,"> Pro gay rights? Pro women's rights pro trans rights? 

Which rights do they lack?"
17073,ivuge4,"Like you said , we fight for individual rights. When each individual has their rights, then each woman, gay, Tran, and atheist will have their rights as well. This tribalism and identity politics the left tries to play is very dangerous. Someone seems to always lose so that another can win."
17074,ivuge4,"ACTIVELY WORK AGAINST? Help me out here. 

Please reference this with more details, links, etc. The only thing I can think of working against is the transgender stuff with kids, and allowing fully developed men/boys who want to compete in womens sporting events- exploiting a clear biological advantage."
17075,ivuge4,Pro legal immigration
17076,ivuge4,Pro *legal immigration of course. We are a nation of immigrants.
17077,ivuge4,"So, you are for zero borders? No more countries, just a global single government?

Hmm..."
17078,ivuge4,"I want to bring in immigrants from all over the world, not just those in close proximity. Skirting the legal process makes those who are following the rules have to wait longer. 
Also, America must still be a pretty good place to have millions of people wanting to come."

17080,ivuge4,The left was strangely comfortable when Obama did it. Guess your morality hinges on who is in the White House? Stupid talking points are stupid.
17081,ivuge4,What's the hash tag?
17082,ivuge4,Yeah but except those transgender ones. We don‚Äôt need those around.
17083,ivuge4,"Actually something so awkward happened today with my family‚Äôs conservative signs. I was coming home with some friends who were dropping me off. One of them (I‚Äôm not sure if they go by he or she) said ‚ÄúI wish who lived there would come out of that house so I can kick their ass‚Äù right as they said that, we stopped in front of that house, and I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it‚Äù. It got so awkward, we gave each other some really uncomfortable car hugs, and I went inside. After I noticed, they hung around the front of my house for like 5 mins, Probably talking about the signs. Not totally sure if they‚Äôll ever want to hang out again."
17084,ivuge4,Good. Live in fear.
17085,ivuge4,"No he's saying that he would, but people are destroying properties of people who have those things on display, making them silent"
17086,ivuge4,Silent because I haven't put up the flag nor the very nice window sticker and bumper stickers because of potential damage to my house or vehicle. So silent I am until I make my voice heard with my vote.
17087,ivuge4,"Right. While that is a logically correct review of the semantics used, I think the argument rests on the scale of positive media exposure and individual tolerance of opposing political thought."
17088,ivuge4,Trump did name the first openly gay person to a cabinet level position - so there‚Äôs that. He was also the first person to put a woman in an executive level position in the 70‚Äôs. He sucks at being a bigot for sure.
17089,ivuge4,link ?
17090,ivuge4,Wasn‚Äôt that study proven to be from a misleading poll on a dating app? Just saying that cause we don‚Äôt want to report false numbers

17092,ivuge4,"You're talking about freebie shit, not RIGHTS. Be honest."
17093,ivuge4,"LOL. My *daughter's* transgender, you moron. I don't want her rights restricted either."
17094,ivuge4,"I vote for candidates, not for the 'R'. However, most of the candidates that I vote for have that 'R"" by their name because they want to uplift **all** people through a robust economy, fair laws, and decent enforcement of those laws. Democrats have proven that they don't care what the laws are, if they don't like them, they ignore them instead of trying to change them. They've proven that they don't care about all people because they attack white people and proclaim from the rooftops that they're for only a few certain demographic. They've proven that they don't care about the economy."
17095,ivuge4,"How did you justify voting for Obama when he didn't support gay marriage?  He was against before he was for it.  Democrats seem to be against until it's popular, then it's down the memory hole and they pretend they've supported all along."
17096,ivuge4,You dont have to imagine.  Just google what they said when Scalia died.
17097,ivuge4,Or Rush after his diagnosis or David Koch after his passing.
17098,ivuge4,You would never find that in my church. Ever. Not in a million years.
17099,ivuge4,"‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt agree with everything I do, you hate me!‚Äù is a child‚Äôs mindset."
17100,ivuge4,Clearly you.
17101,ivuge4,"Whoa, buddy.  You're kind of all over the place there. ;)  But let me try to address your main point.  Of course, in today's political climate, you'll find a certain degree of vitriol coming from both sides.  Obviously, we are speaking in generalities here, which is why I used phrases like, ""generally speaking,"" and ""tends to.""  However, the amount of animus we are now seeing from the Left far exceeds that which we see on the Right.  In my opinion, it is not even close.  

Think about it.  Many leftists are simply unwilling to have a conversation anymore, just like in the example posted here.  We have left wing groups taking to the streets by the thousands all over the country, and burning businesses, assaulting, and even murdering people.  You just don't see that from the Right.  I'm willing to talk out my differences with people whom I disagree.  But I would never dream of invading a restaurant and screaming in peoples faces, insisting that the hold up their fists in solidarity with my cause."
17102,ivuge4,"Yes and let's completely focus on the very few number of murders committed by police and blame it on the entire police force...

See the hypocrisy?"
17103,ivuge4,"With all due respect, just about everything you said is incorrect or seriously skewed.  I'll agree with you about the QAnon stuff though.  In my opinion, that's a bunch modern-day Nostradamus-type cryptic nonsense that can be interpreted in any way that the reader desires.  

However, as far as the Mueller Report, it did not show any collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.  In fact, Robert Mueller testified that the Russians attempted to do so, and the Trump team rejected their efforts.  As well, there were clear abuses of the FISA courts in order to obtain warrants on American citizens based on unsubstantiated information.  If President Bush had done this to the incoming Obama administration in 2008-2009, you might think differently about it.  And you'd be right to feel that way.  

Hydroxychloroquine is a more complicated matter.  There is conflicting evidence on the efficacy of the drug in treating CoVid19.  But it is generally considered to be safe, with a decades long track record, and is available over-the-counter in many countries.  I believe the vehement opposition to it's use is mainly politically based.  Just like Senator Harris'and VP Biden's recent statements about a possible upcoming vaccine (which they are now beginning to walk back.)  I mean, if my doctor thinks it's right for me (or at least harmless) why should she not have the option to prescribe it?  

In regards of the ""right-wing echo chamber""  I'm afraid you have that exactly backwards.  I'm looking for the study now that Tim Pool is constantly citing, and I'll link it as soon as I find it.  But it shows that, while most people on the right, left, and middle, consume news media sources that confirm their own biases, the Right gets roughly 30%-35% of their news from left-leaning sources and the Left gets less than 5% from right-leaning sources.  I'm just going by memory, so please forgive me if me numbers are a little off.  I'll correct it, if so.   

With respect to the protests/riots, the focus is on the violence because everyone agrees with peaceful protesting.  Even if I disagree with the cause, I will always support the right of the people to peaceably assemble.  There's no issue there.  But there has been over $2 billion in property damage and dozen of lives lost in the riots thus far.  Should we just ignore that?  

Finally, you are correct that not everyone on the Left is a socialist.  However, socialism used to be a dirty word in this country.  Now, not only do far too many young people have a favorable view of socialism, but many prominent Democrat politicians, like Bernie Sanders and AOC (among others) have openly adopted it.  

Look, I appreciate the civil discussion, and I would like to continue the conversation.  But let's take one issue at a time if you don't mind.  That's a lot of typing for a Saturday afternoon.  ;)  Thanks."

         As far as the immigrants themselves, there is only a certain amount of immigration that our infrastructure can sustain. As much as people would like to try to deny it, there is absolutely no way to claim that 40 years of unfettered illegal immigration hasn't harmed the poorest U.S. citizens. Usually poor persons of color. 
          Legal immigration is wonderful and legal immigrants make some of the best American citizens. If you want to have a debate about making the process easier, that's fine.

It's already illegal to discriminate against a person based on their race, gender, sexuality, etc.

The ""equality act"" was an attempt to shove through some extra shit the dems wanted, not to help the LGBT community. It had nothing to do with equality or protection or rights or anything like that. That was just the marketing spin.

> Appointed anti-LGBTQ judges: Trump has appointed anti-LGBTQ judges with alarming anti-LGBTQ records to appointments at every level of the judicial system, including anti-equality Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and federal nominees Kacsmaryk, Mateer, Bounds, Vitter. Menashi and others.

This is just fear mongering. You have no evidence of this claim. Nobody does. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are constitutionalists. Neither has made any steps to attack any of the things you crazies have claimed they were going to attack. In fact, both have protected things like Roe v Wade.

Going down the list of shit there, it's clear there's no evidence for any of it. Which is why they don't even attempt to provide it."

Reading through comments here, some from people who are members of the ""marginalized"" people you listed, no laws exist on the books that undermine LGBT rights.

As for the LGB part of LGBT, I myself am bisexual. But I do not have relationships with the same-sex, out of a respect for my God. The same is true for those  who are same-sex monosexuals. 
Some in the theological Orthodox(I am conservative theologically) category do indeed hold that Homosexuality is indeed in and of itself wrong. But we in the conservative category view it as a temptation."
17184,ivuge4,What rights would that be?
17185,ivuge4,"Not quite.
Being cisgender, or Cis, simply means that the junk you were born with lines up with your gender.

Transgender means that they don't match up.
So when you see something like ""cishet white man"" it means your junk and brain match up, you're attracted to people of the opposite sex, you're white, and male. It sounds like a bunch of spooky buzz words but its really not that strange.

Why do people talk about this stuff? Because it's useful shorthand. People who are cis generally share a lot of experiences with other people who are cis, the same goes for trans people. (Puberty being awkward but kinda exciting vs a living nightmare, for example.)

Thats an example of the dreaded ""privilege"", by the way. In context, the word means that -in general- the group you're a part of has it easier than another group.

Cis people have it easier than trans people. Straight people have it easier than gay people. White people have it easier than black people, and men have it easier than women. 

Thats where check your privilege comes from, by the way. It's a response to someone making an argument based on assumptions that other people just can't make. I'm privileged because I had a stable home life, I got to go on field trips and such because I always had a parent who could sign for stuff like that. If I made a comment along the lines of ""if your dads working just have your mom sign it, duh"" check your privilege would be an appropriate response.


I know you didn't ask for an explanation for any of this, but we're on a thread thats supposedly all about y'all being tolerant and willing to talk things out."
17186,ivuge4,"So if you thought someone was killing a baby, your response would be. ""No my problem"".

Ok. And no, your wrong that makes you not human.

And yes I do understand that the pro-choice people do not believe it's a baby. which is all well and good and that's what they need to do to sleep at night. I'm really pointing out what the other side believes.

17192,ivuge4,Who made that legal in the first place?
17193,ivuge4,"Well the first article paywalled me, but I‚Äôll try on my PC at home. The second article felt a little short on the hard facts im looking for. They point out Obama‚Äôs last three years and those jobs being due to recovering from a recession, but I‚Äôd argue the recession was far enough in the rear view we can‚Äôt attribute everything to that. They argued that Trump has hit record lows for unemployment, which is true and I applaud, but it is also just following the trends from Obama‚Äôs second term. It was trending down and you‚Äôd expect that to give record lows. The stock market was trending up, and you would expect that to give record highs. 

Now I‚Äôm not saying Obama had insanely good financial policy and the Trump economy is really His economy. I do think Trump has stimulated the economy quite well, you can see a little acceleration in stock growth and unemployment continuing to follow the trend down, despite what the article said (which makes sense and I expect is very accurate) about it being harder to make jobs with lower unemployment. 

I‚Äôm 100% sure the economy is doing a bit better under Trump, but honestly it does seem to be just a bit better. That bit may be worth it, but when I look at the deficit doubling to accomplish it, I have to question if that increase is sustainable and if not... what happens when the can can‚Äôt be kicked any further down the road? I‚Äôm still learning, like I said. I don‚Äôt have this 100% straight. I appreciate we can discuss it here. Whereas in other conservative subs I‚Äôve literally been permabanned for mentioning it.

Edit: as someone below pointed out, I made a mistake above. I put debt instead of deficit for doubling. I meant deficit lol, just typing in mobile is painful."
17194,ivuge4,I‚Äôve found nothing but relatively civil discourse here. I am a huge fan of this sub actually. I‚Äôm pretty much as in between Democrats and Republicans as you can get.
17195,ivuge4,"I‚Äôve looked at many of those and mostly just see the same thing though. Continuing trends. Now I can see a bump in the data, where the trend accelerated with Trump. It just also coincided with our deficit almost doubling. I‚Äôm just not seeing it as sustainable, but I am still learning. I‚Äôm second year in medical school now at a inexpensive state university, so I‚Äôll have the money to invest soon. I want to learn by then how it all functions lol."

17208,ivuge4,"Thanks for the explanation. Why would one identify themselves as some one who is content with their genitals? It's actually more strange than you would think.

Yesterday I had a conversation and I said: yesterday really was a busy day. She said: oh nice what did you I do? Me: well in the morning I had a funeral.... Should she have checked her privilege because that day was so nice to her? No, why should I care?"
17209,ivuge4,"Well what if the ""other side"" believes you are poisoning kids by giving them juice instead of beer?

It is not enough to know only *what* the other side believes, but why. What is the basis for the opinion?

If it is a medical issue, such as poisoning through juice, or at which point a clump of cells can be designated as a baby, then your opinion is not worth anything unless you have the utmost medical qualifications to base it off of. That means more than just the most basic level of education in that field, it means more than a bachelors degree, or a masters degree. It means years of experience in a field of which you are a doctor of. It means that the very top experts from around the world reviewing your years of research and experience, analyzing and criticizing, and reviewing it all.

Beyond the fact that your opinion is meaningless without any kind of education, knowledge and wisdom, the ""other side"" can believe with the same intensity and ferocity that you, for example, burning old car tyres in your back yard, is causing the same amount of harm, or even more, because it affects multiple lives, hundreds, thousands or even billions. Or that it's even worse because it involves creating suffering, rather than the relatively instant process of abortion.

Or to make another comparison, think you are a monster in the same way you do about ""pro choice"" supporters because you eat meat. Not only involves killing an animal, but raising them in abhorrent conditions and systematically, industrially slaughtering them in the millions, or even billions each year.

Just because you can't understand why something is important to someone, doesn't make it unimportant, after all. 

You can't pick and choose which issues you get up in arms and protest about, because I can guarantee that you will be hypocritical in some way.

At the end of the day, it is the antithesis of being a true republican to declare that you can do whatever you want without scrutiny, accountability or criticism but that it does not apply to someone else.

And, for the record, I am a republican and a conservative."

¬ï‚Ä¢ Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual¬ís as a ""discreet and insular minority"" entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.

¬ï‚Ä¢ Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. **Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.**

I'm not an American myself, but Americans always ""identify"" themselves, this concept is very foreign to me! You identify yourself as tall? Aren't you tall or not? Isn't that factual?  And if someone says you are privileged because you are white (for example) without knowing you, aren't they making 100x more assumptions about you based on nothing?

Not to mention the outright denial of basic biology in pretending sex is a social construct.


So you've got a choice, really. Either you vote for the party where one dude pushes horrible shit. Or you vote for a party where the fundamental belief system is horrible. Make no mistake, intersectionality, critical theory, this is all now the basis that the democrats are going to govern from."

17251,ivuge4,"Your point was that giving someone special treatment because of a race, gender, religion was bigotry. I‚Äôve pointed out it‚Äôs not. You wanted to use semantics and it just didn‚Äôt work out for you. That‚Äôs ok!

What you were attempting to do was show that because there‚Äôs been a trend towards tipping the scales, and because tipping those scales requires acknowledging the different experiences groups in aggregate have had, that it is in itself unfair, prejudicial, etc. 

I‚Äôm not sure that I necessarily agree with that because oftentimes folks have a hard time seeing the struggles that others have gone through. So it might seem like your own experience is getting worse as you  watch that of other groups get better. From that perspective of course it‚Äôs unfair. ‚ÄúI had a hard time doing x, why should anyone else get more of a helping hand?‚Äù.  For me, I‚Äôve seen first hand how aspects of my life have made it easier and other aspects have made it harder. I‚Äôm also fortunate that I have a keen self awareness and can recognize particular behaviors or habits have held me back. This gives me a tool that I have relied on time and time again as I‚Äôve in my 31 years gotten to a pretty overall happy life, with financial security. 

I have seen firsthand how my experience has been different from those of other backgrounds and it has shaped my world view. I don‚Äôt want to win at the expense of others - that‚Äôs not that fun or rewarding. Rather I‚Äôd like to be the winner in a field of strong contenders. With that in mind I do think that we have a responsibility to make some real changes in our society so that folks have more chances at success. Sadly (or not) that does sometimes require us to recognize certain groupings that have led to reduced opportunities if only so that we can start to overcome them.

As far as whether it makes things ‚Äúunfair‚Äù or ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù"
17252,ivuge4,"Well it would be super disingenuous. It would be one thing to look at it if like the second year of his presidency Covid hit in January. But we have three years precovid. A year for policy making and a year or two for effects to hit market and deficits to be seen. Enough for trends to establish in my mind anyways. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to contaminate your results by adding such a short time frame to the end that is clearly not representative. 

I‚Äôm not really pro trump or pro Obama. I think Obama did well, but could have done better. I think Trump has done well, but could have done better. I think Obama acted more presidential, considering the Trump tweet tantrums, but honestly as much as I like to have a good orator/professional character in charge... it‚Äôs just sorta secondary to policy for me."

17254,ivuge4,"I‚Äôm not even American, so I have absolutely no horse in this race - I‚Äôm neither a republican or a democrat: I‚Äôm a swing voter in my country, and I vote on policy, not party. You‚Äôve already shifted the goal posts - I provided evidence of Pence supporting conversion therapy, and now apparently that is fine because ‚Äúthe left‚Äù is worse? Not sure what you‚Äôre accusing ‚Äúthe left‚Äù of is worse than the literal physical and psychological torture of already vulnerable people (usually teenagers), but I‚Äôm bored, so:

Citation needed on Democrats who support conversion therapy. If you‚Äôre going to equate Pence with the left, show me someone of a similar status on the left who supports conversion therapy.

You‚Äôve got the transphobe thing incorrect. Attraction is not something you can direct - you‚Äôre either attracted to someone or you‚Äôre not. Having preferences is totally normal, and not being attracted to someone who happens to be trans is not transphobic. Saying that you would never be attracted to someone who is trans simply because they‚Äôre trans *is*, because the only thing about that person you are presenting as a negative in this instance is the fact that they‚Äôre transgender. 

Sex is not a social construct - at least, not in the way you‚Äôre implying. Gender is more of a social construct - it is social, cultural and psychological. Sex is *wholly* biological, and is determined by hormones, chromosomes, and sex characteristics (primary and secondary). You are biologically either male, female, or intersex. But our bodies would exist even if we didn‚Äôt categorise them, and it is important to remember - biology didn‚Äôt categorise itself. Humans are the ones who looked at body parts and chromosomes and hormones and decided that ‚Äúthis combination of genitals, hormones and chromosomes means that this person is biologically male, and this other combination means that this person is biologically female, and if there is a combination of the two then that mean the person is biologically intersex‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a social construct, but how we categorise biology is very much influenced by the time and place, as well as the tendency of humans to divide things into binaries (one or the other) because it makes things simpler (but with any kind of complexity, it doesn‚Äôt account for the other options, the in between, the grey between the black and white of the binary).

Intersectionality is the idea that everyone is influenced by the different aspects of who they are. A rich straight black man living in Australia has a different experience to a working class queer white woman living in Texas. Acknowledging the intersections of identity (ethnicity, religion, sexuality, nationality, gender, socio-economic class) in politics is acknowledging that everyone is a complex being, and that there are a number of different things that influence how we can and do live our lives. Intersectionality isn‚Äôt a bad thing, and I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre presenting it as such."

* Russia collusion lies that wasted 2 years and cost us taxpayers $40 million. They knew all along Russia collusion was fake. Mueller knew before he started the fake investigation. That's why they tried to pivot to obstruction of justice, but there wasn't any obstruction either. The whole thing was a plan to smear Trump while they tried to cook up evidence against him

* Brett Kavanaugh sh!@show where he was mercilessly attacked with exactly zero evidence and Blasey-Ford's own witnesses all denied her story. It was sickening to watch

* Ukraine quid-pro-quo lies where every single witness they called all said under oath that they had no evidence or knowledge of a quid-pro-quo. The one exception was the guy who said President Trump specifically told him he didn't want anything in return. So the only actual evidence was evidence against quid-pro-quo but the disgusting dishonest Dims maintained their shampeachment anyway

* there is now significant evidence that the plan to frame Michael Flynn went all the way to Obama and Biden (why am I not surprised)

* the pork that Pelosi and her cult are trying to push into the covid19 relief packages

* the two-faced switch the Dims have done about illegal immigration (Obama, Clinton, Schumer, Pelosi, etc are all on record as supporting the stopping of illegals coming into this country. But now they all oppose it because the want the votes from illegals and they oppose everything and anything that Trump supports)

* the Dims are supporting and encouraging the riots and looting. They're doing nothing to stop it. And looking for ways to attack Trump about it

* it's all Dims who are defunding the police. Minneapolis city council is the biggest clown show on the planet currently where they're going ahead with disbanding the police but have no idea and zero plan what they're going to replace police with. And at the same time those idiots are the height of hypocrisy because they're making the city pay for them to have private security. (Security for me, but not for thee!) And then De Blasio is trying to outdo them all single-handedly. NYC has already cut police funding by $100 million, laid off 600 police, they're seeing police retirements increase by 49%, there's a spike in violent crimes in NYC, and DeBozo is rolling out a plan to further cut the NYPD by $1 Billion

Everything the Dims do can be summarized by this list:

* lie

* lie about President Trump

* manipulate voters and the (willingly complicit press) for more power

* oppose Trump

* hate the United States

* line their pockets

* pander and virtue signal

* Have rules for thee but not for me (constant enormous hypocrisy)"

I want you to consider what the founding fathers would have wanted is for you to inform yourself and vote for who you feel is the most qualified person.

17350,hida4o,"The founding fathers would despise the Democrat party today for their corruption and their selling out and desire to destroy America.  The first and second amendments are under attack by Dims every day and have been for years as one simple example.

The Republicans are often spineless and ineffective. They are far from perfect and waaaaay too many are deep state corrupt snakes.

But on the whole, the Democrats are the antithesis of America, what it stands for, and what it was founded on. Democrats at this point are evil.

Your attempt to equate Trump with the level of corruption by Democrats is insanely off the mark.

Did Trump attempt a coup against the incoming president? No, but Obama, Biden, Comey, Brennan, Clapper, and company did. That is treason with a capital T.

Did President Trump make up lies about Russia collusion and start a phony investigation in an attempt to dig up dirt or outright frame the sitting president? No but Brennan, Comey, Clapper did aided by the Democrat liars.

Did President Trump cost taxpayers $40 million on a fake Russia collusion hoax? No, but the Dims did.

Did President Trump go on TV hundreds of time saying he had direct evidence of Russia collusion even though he knew there was no evidence and never did produce such evidence? No, but Shifty Schiff, Pelosi, Schumer, Swallwell and other Dems did.

Did President Trump attempt to frame Michael Flynn by falsely claiming he lied to the FBI and then had the prosecution withhold exculpatory evidence in the case so that Flynn could not fairly defend himself? No, but Comey and Strozk did at the direction of Obama and Biden and aided by the support of the Dims.

Did President Trump slander Brett Kavanaugh by lying about a sexual attack that never happened and drag him and his family through the mud in a highly publicized hearing on TV? No, but Blasey Ford did, backed by Pelosi and Schumer and the DNC lawyers.

Did President Trump give Iran $150 Billion including $1.5 Billion is US dollars ca$h? No, but Barack Hussein and Biden did.

Did President Trump get his son a multimillion payout from Burisma, one of the most corrupt companies in Ukraine, without any skills or knowledge and then threaten to withhold $1 Billion in US loan guarantees unless Ukraine fires the prosecutor who is investigating Burisma? No, but Biden did. And then he bragged about it on video too because not only is he corrupt, he's also stupid.

Did President Trump make up a fake quid-pro-quo with Ukraine, interview 18 people who all said there was no quid-pro-quo and then ignore the evidence, proceed with a fake impeachment anyway, and lie to the American people about it? No, but Shifty Schiff, Pelosi, Schumer, and Nadless did with the backing of most of the witless Dims. Schiff even lied and said he released the transcripts of ""all"" 17 witnesses. But there were 18 witnesses who testified. Why does Schiff lie and say there were only 17 witnesses when there were 18? And why won't he release the testimony of Michael Atkinson? Why did all the Dims lie and say the ""whistleblower"" has to have his identity protected when that's not what the law dictates and everyone knows who it was anyway? I know the answers and they aren't flattering to the Dims.

Did President Trump tell people in New York and Chinatown that they should ignore covid19 warnings and go out on the town? No, but Pelosi and De Blasio did. Then they attacked Trump when people died. They should both be prosecuted for negligent homicide.

Did President Trump put sick elderly covid19 patients into nursing homes leading to rampant spread of covid19 and tens of thousands of deaths in nursing homes? No, but Cuomo did. Cuomo too should be prosecuted for the tens of thousands of extra deaths he caused by his policy of putting covid19 patients back into nursing homes. Everyone knew the elderly are the most at-risk group. Cuomo's actions are mass murder. Intentionally infecting tens of thousands of elderly nursing home residents with covid19.

Need I go on? I could write a book just off the top of my head. With time to research it could be encyclopedic.

As a side note, I'll add that all of the Dim shenanigans are aided by a very deceitful and complicit mainstream media. For anything negative you think you know about President Trump there's at least a 90% chance it's wrong because the Dims or the media are lying to you. (Most likely both.)

He's not perfect, far from it, and I've never said he is. But if he is so bad, why then the need for the constant lies by the Dims and media? Shouldn't the truth alone be enough. But since it's not, that should tell you a lot.

Dims and the media have to lie because Trump is actually very good and they can't have the truth getting out. Better for them to keep people as misinformed sheep because they're easier to manipulate and control that way."

17360,hida4o,There are also rumors (unconfirmed) that he first heard about it in late 2019.
17361,hida4o,The National Intelligence Community has stated the President and Vice President both [were not briefed on this topic.](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/3277696001)  These rumors started from the NYT and AP.

Would it not be best to hear what the administration advisors responsible for relaying the information to the president have to say under oath? Withholding information about bounties on our troops from the commander in chief seems like it should be a big deal.
17367,hida4o,"Campaign finances are already something that‚Äôs regulated. Private individuals have a maximum cap that they can donate to politicians. There‚Äôs a precedent that already exists in the law. Now, the reason I have for more regulation on campaign finance is that I don‚Äôt like that people from different states and/or districts are able to influence someone else‚Äôs representation. I believe it is unethical and immoral. I would never donate to a candidate running in an election that doesn‚Äôt have me being able to vote in. It‚Äôs election interference. 

Edit: I have changed course and believe in term limits"
17368,hida4o,"If it comes has to come down fo that, then yes open an investigation. Multiple articles state that the information was withheld from being passed along to the president. I just find this so funny because what happened to the so called ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù and the witch hunt for 4-5 years? How do you go from ‚Äúthe man colluded with Russia although we have no evidence‚Äù to ‚Äúhe knew about bounties and we still have no evidence‚Äù?"
17369,hida4o,"Big deal, yes. But withholding this information from the American public, isn‚Äôt out of line. The reaction to this information is the exact reason the American public couldn‚Äôt handle something like this. Personally, I would like transparency, but if this is the way people react to it, then I‚Äôd much rather the government deal with this behind closed doors. 

We don‚Äôt even have all of the information, whose to say this hasn‚Äôt been dealt with? How do we know there isn‚Äôt intel and threats like this in a daily basis? More troops died under Obama than Bush and Trump combine x3. Trump has had historic low deaths in Afganistan, since the invasion. In 2020 we‚Äôre on pace to have fewer deaths in Afganistan than 2019. I wish for there to be no deaths, but I‚Äôm a numbers guy, if this ‚Äúbounty‚Äù were true, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd have more troops dead in Afganistan.

At this time I can‚Äôt dismiss it as false, I need more facts before I make a stance. For all we know this is true, but it was settled behind closed doors, and the information leaked after the fact."
17370,hida4o,"Ironically, the same intelligence community that stated there was ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù has also stated the President was not briefed on the current rumors. The left has backed themselves into a corner. They have to believe the intelligence community or they‚Äôll look like hypocrites."

Perhaps we should less try to malign people on the right or left by saying those who committed violence affiliated themselves with a shared general political ideology rather than examine why any aspects of a political identity are used for the unhinged to rationalize their actions. Falling into tribalism and poisoning the well by pointing to either Dayton or El Paso gives us room to ignore troubling indications that we are dealing with more pernicious, fundamental problems as a society. These tragedies aren't plays in a team sport; everyone in America lost when they occurred. Playing up the politics is what cable news does to make more money, and we can't claim to be above it when we fall into the same trap, whether it happens here or in a mirrored fashion on r/politics.

Stop lying. Why do people pretend the media isn't covering something when they clearly are? Here's just a small cross section of the hundreds of articles on the subject. This fake victim complex where we lie and pretend the media isn't covering something is peak snowflake behaviour.

""Authorities searched the Betts' family home in Bellbrook, a suburb southeast of Dayton, and uncovered writings that expressed an interest in killing people, two law enforcement sources told CNN.

But the writings did not indicate any racial or political motive, sources said.""

As opposed to the coverage given to the motives of the el Paso shooter (rightly so), you dont detect any sense of intellectual dishonesty?

I think what he means by little to no coverage is the clear political leanings of the shooter given that he posted a lot about NOT WAITING FOR SOCIALISM, and a lot of anti-trump / Republican rhetoric."

17446,cmdb8g,"That‚Äôs actually not true, rather the narrative the left has pushed (rather successfully) to cover their past. Lincoln was a republican. Republicans elected the first black man to office. Republicans elected the first woman to office. Republicans were in favor of reunification after the Civil War and allowing black people to vote. Democrats imposed the harsh ‚ÄúReconstruction Era‚Äù to include the 1/3 voting rule and Jim Crow laws. Democrats like to push that party views ‚Äúswitched‚Äù around Lyndon Johnson. However there are numerous people and accounts that Johnson was at best a segregationist and at worst an actual member of the KKK. He‚Äôs been quoted as saying in regards to the Civil Rights Bill that ‚Äúif them niggers are gonna vote then they might as well vote for us‚Äù. Also that ‚Äúhe‚Äôd have them voting for the Democrats for the next 60 years with his Welfare Bill‚Äù. Just look at today. Look at the worst cities in the nation like Detroit and Chicago. Democrat run. Look at the worst districts in the nation. Cummings over Baltimore, Waters over Compton and Watts, he‚Äôll look at all the homeless and drug issues San Francisco is having under Pelosi. Hell, President Bush had more women and minorities in cabinet and appointed positions than Clinton, and Trump has appointed more women than any other president. Tough to know that when 93% of journalists identify as Democrat. Man I tell you, Republicans really like to hold down anyone not a white man. Look, in conclusion, being a Democrat doesn‚Äôt make you a racist or bigot. Neither does being a Republican. However if you review history and facts, most of the race issues have indeed stemmed from Democrats. Remember Obama‚Äôs handling of the Baltimore and Ferguson riots? People simply need to wake up and make better informed decisions rather than what CNN or Fox News is peddling at the moment.

17460,htky2l,"I only stated that to show how the comment you made about 80% of people agree that biologists should be the ones to make the decision since this group would include people who don‚Äôt care about their opinions on other subjects - Like wearing a mask for covid to protect other lives. Just seemed contradictory and moreso a subject by subject basis type of thing that these people believe in science to make the right choices. Nothing I said makes me think I‚Äôm equipped to make a decision for someone‚Äôs body and an experience they have to go through...which is my whole angle. Let them do what they want to do and give them a chance to make a decision. Having unprotected sex shouldn‚Äôt force you down a certain path. Not to mention the whole aspect of rape and having to keep a baby...I said a few months to generalize and meant that they should have a certain period of time to make a decision. In the end, this seems like a topic you and I will differ on and I do respect your opinion and your views. I just have a different thought process on it. I don‚Äôt think wanting an abortion makes someone a murderer.."
17461,htky2l,"I don't think anyone disagrees that babies matter, they mostly disagree on what exactly a baby is and when a baby exists. But you know üíÅ"
17462,htky2l,"My problem is that while everyone argues about where life begins and if abortion is murder, there is usually no consideration of what the condition of that life is thereafter. 

Let‚Äôs say abortion is wrong and you force someone to have a child that they don‚Äôt want, that child‚Äôs life is only cared for to the point of it being born. After birth any thought of it‚Äôs well being is gone and most likely that child will end up in the system or neglected by the parent who didn‚Äôt want it in the first place. 

You could argue that life is better than no life and a chance to live is an opportunity that everyone deserves but what kind of life that these types of situations create is often left out of a pro life argument."

Paid maternity leave
Free healthcare for kids

Financial Support for mums and families to afford baby necessities.  
All of those things have been proven to be very beneficial for not only baby, but there family as well. 
But that's socialism, and we can't have that now."
17469,htky2l,I feel like we defund planned parenthood and reinvest that money into the children and adoption houses.  Also allow those who are same-sex couples the right to adopt.  Its a shame that we have children that go homeless and what not whenever there are good couples able to care for these babies.
17470,htky2l,"women need free access to abortion in order to achieve full political, social, and economic equality with men

The ""right to life"" also doesn't imply a right to live by threatening somebody else's life. Bearing that the fetus is always a threat the life of the mother"

I personally was a kid who was supposed to be aborted, but my mom convinced my dad that keeping me was the best idea for both of them. Ironically, my mom, who wanted me, was the one who abused me"
17537,htky2l,"Best case: the mother and father discover the joy and meaningfulness of caring for a child and go on to be great parents.
Worst case: the father isn't in the picture, and the mother has a deep-seated dislike for the child that causes them major emotional pain, and they grow up in a difficult financial situation. Still, the beauty of life means that they have the option to overcome their difficult childhood and live their adult life to the fullest. I'd say this is still far preferable to being murdered as an infant."
17538,htky2l,"We know.

But we also know that some democrats have come out as so PRO abortion that they think it's ""a woman's choice"" to kill the baby as it is literally being delivered and that grosses most sane people out."

17541,htky2l,">that child‚Äôs life is only cared for to the point of it being born. After birth any thought of it‚Äôs well being is gone 

This isn‚Äôt necessarily true. I guarantee you that if people were going around murdering children in foster homes or murdering children in abusive homes, the pro life group would be just as upset/vocal, if not more upset and more vocal."
17542,htky2l,"I will say this again.

When you put these conditions on opinion...like, ""You think abortion is wrong but you don't want to support kids after they are born"" it's:

1) Incorrect.  Aid for pregnant women and women with dependent kids is the SIMPLEST aid to get.

2) Like telling someone, ""Sure, you SAY that you think it's important for people to eat a healthy diet...but I don't see you out there buying people healthy food to eat.""

One is entitled to have an opinion about what is right and wrong without being forced to PAY for the lives of others."
17543,htky2l,">most likely that child will end up in the system

This is totally false. Every infant put up for adoption (in the US) is adopted by a couple who has gone through background checks and tests to ensure they would make good parents.

>You could argue that life is better than no life and a chance to live is an opportunity that everyone deserves but what kind of life that these types of situations create is often left out of a pro life argument.

It's often left out because it has no effect on people's conclusions. As you say, pro-lifers believe the chance to live is what should make abortion illegal, and the quality of that life doesn't change that stance."
17544,htky2l,"Worst case brain activity, I‚Äôd argue for conception though."
17545,htky2l,This question is above my pay grade.
17546,htky2l,"Conception. As soon as a child is conceived, unless acted upon by outside force or natural cause of miscarriage, it will develop into a human being. Breaking that chain of events is halting the life of the child.

Only solid line I can really draw. This isn‚Äôt to say I don‚Äôt think people shouldn‚Äôt be able to get abortions, but human development begins at conception."

If we were really serious about preventing any abortions, we should make vasectomies required at puberty to ensure no one get pregnant without the intent of having a baby.

If a cancer cell mutates, creating a unique DNA strand, is it a human life? No, obviously not. Also as to your 'counter argument' to murder masturbating, the way sperm cells are created means that they have unique strands from your own DNA, small little errors happen in almost every cell division. I mean, the fact that not all children of a couple look identical should give away the fact that the DNA from different sperm cells is unique to each other. 

Notice the cell division errors, it means that even your own cells differ from each other genetically. That is no way to base a concept of individuality on. It's complicated and the issue is as much a social and philosophical question as it is a biological one. I'm not saying there's no biology involved here, the standard practice is that abortion cannot be done after a rudimental consciousness has developed. However, biology is obviously not the only answer in a debate like this. 

I guess the big misconception here is in who people feel is the actor of the person punished in the situation. E.g. you mention rape and you say 'a child should not be punished for the sins of its father'. What about the woman or girl that was raped? She has to go through with 9 months of pregnancy just to deliver a child she didn't chose for? The child is not born, the child as such doesn't exist yet. To be honest, I agree with you that it is a bit of a non-argument, because as you say it is a small minority (maybe not as small as you say, but still) of cases. Still the question remains, who should we look out for. The unborn child, the mother or both maybe? What is a just way of looking at this problem while respecting the choices of everyone involved."
17647,htky2l,"What about the many married women who become pregnant because their birth control fails, vasectomy reverses, or they were told by a doctor they were infertile? Do we really expect people who have been married for years to abstain from sex because there is a very real chance that they might get pregnant?

Women don‚Äôt get a choice on whether they have to undergo a very, very serious medical process.)"
17648,htky2l,">there's almost always an active choice to have sex. When you take on such an activity, you take on the risks that follow.

Even assuming consent from both parties, it's not like pro-life policy goes hand in hand with safe sex practices. If someone is taking birth control medicine, and using condoms, there's still an tiny chance for a pregnancy to happen. I'll return to this point later.
>They don't want to just rape abortions to exist. They like to use the 0.1% of abortions to justify the other 99.9%

The issue is a spectrum, of course there are people who are for abortion in cases of rape and incest, but not for other circumstances. One's theoretical motivations do not impact the validity of an argument. Furthermore, considering edge cases is a solid way to establish morality in less cut and dry circumstances.

> Its worth noting, you will not find a pro life individual that supports banning an abortion that causes severe risk to the mother. Absolutely, you save the life of the mother.

This is disingenuous, there are individuals who are against abortion in any circumstances.


My belief is that abortion should always be legal in the case of rape, incest, when there is severe risk to the mother, or when the child will suffer a terrible genetic condition that will be painful and fatal. Focusing on the first, If a woman and her boyfriend were practicing safe sex (Birth control pills, non-piv sex) but she was raped and ends up pregnant, I see that as fairly similar to living in Alaska, and having someone break into your home during an especially frigid winter. While it may be morally right to allow that person to stay in your home until it's safe to come out, the government shouldn't mandate that you use YOUR home to house this person.

 If you're putting signs out that say ""Come on in"" perhaps that's different, but there is a financial, emotional, and physical burden to carrying a pregnancy, and I haven't seen anyone ever propose paying women to carry their pregnancies that they didn't have any choice in having."
17649,htky2l,Actually you can find pro life people that still don‚Äôt support abortion even if it means putting the mother at risk. I‚Äôm one of them.
17650,htky2l,"Ok. The argument is that it‚Äôs a human being. But some people want an abortion because they can‚Äôt afford to raise a child safely, or it poses a risk of killing the mother, or the woman wanted to have sex for pleasure, not reproduction"
17651,htky2l,"You know, nobody actually gets the choice of consent to live. There's no consent in being born either."
17652,htky2l,Because putting a child up for adoption is a great idea! It totally will have a great life and not be in the system for years.
17653,htky2l,What risk to men have when they have sex? They don‚Äôt get pregnant. The worst that a man can get is an STD. Women also have that risk in addition to having something grow in her.

Women who need abortions should get them, but if we want to get those numbers down, and believe me I think most people do, then it requires contraception, sex education, and affordable access to prenatal and neonatal care.

However, as the article points out there's a lot of discussion to be followed after this point and most biologists are pro choice for a good reason. The 'thinking' individual with a developed consciousness obviously follows conception, but is not there immediately after. Even though the author is trying to be very neutral, after some point he can't resist to say the following; 

>¬†while the other sees abortion as an epic human rights tragedy‚Äîas¬†over a billion humans¬†have died in abortions since the year 2000

Here he loses a bit of his neutrality in my opinion as it is a huge step to go from zygote to fetus to a human individual. If we're talking about humans dieing we talk about a fully developed human. If you have a miscarriage early on in the pregnancy it is not seen as a human death, statistics are not collected as a human death. It can still be very traumatic and so can an abortion be. 

Either way, the article is interesting in a way and it suggests a limit to abortions based on how far the fetus is developed and I do think that most biologists will agree to this, giving that there are no serious medical reasons that would justify late abortion. If this is really the compromise people in the US are ready for, then I'm all for it. What that time would be is ofcourse still up for debate then.

Also just to add to this; there is already a limit for abortion; and I'm sure there's one in the USA as well. [Most (66%) of the abortions take place within 8 weeks and 91% within the first trimester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States)"

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs practical or realistic to expect married couples to never have sex unless they are actively hoping to get pregnant. At the very least, the abortion pill should be legal and free. While there are some super hard line people who think even birth control is tantamount to ‚Äúkilling an innocent person‚Äù, I think most people realize there has to at least be a period of time early on where a woman can consent to going through a pregnancy and give birth.

If someone hooked me up to a machine against my will, that was sustaining someone else's life, I think I would be justified in removing my connection to the machine, even if the someone else is entirely innocent in this circumstance. If there was some procedure I could do now to make it so that other person wouldn't die, then of course I would do it, but if I had to spend 9 months tied to the machine to keep the other person alive, suffer financial hardship, hinder my career advancement, deal with the stress of being attached against my will, etc. I think I would be justified in removing the connection, even though it would end up in the death of the other person."

Let me put it this way.

Say your mother is dying of kidney failure. She needs a transplant or she's going to die. Unfortunately the only way for her to survive until she can get the transplant is to be connected to someone else's kidneys. You volunteer to be surgically connected for a day until the other kidney arrives.

There is a complication and she is now comatose. The other kidney is delayed and her condition has deteriorated to the point where if you were to be disconnected from her, she would die. You can't give her your kidney at this point because it would still require detaching her. The doctors give you an estimate of a month before they can get another kidney.

Do you have the right to be disconnected if you wanted to be?"

To which you answer ""People who support abortion"", which is patently untrue.

I believe you misunderstood the question, and just answered with your thoughts.

True, but I think legal protections should apply to all living humans, rather than just conscious individuals.

>Either way, the article is interesting in a way and it suggests a limit to abortions based on how far the fetus is developed and I do think that most biologists will agree to this, giving that there are no serious medical reasons that would justify late abortion. If this is really the compromise people in the US are ready for, then I'm all for it. What that time would be is ofcourse still up for debate then.

I agree that the article is an interesting one, and hope that both sides of the debate can find some common ground.

17831,htky2l,You think the woman who would bear the pains of pregnancy for nine months would just decide on a abortion at the last moment?
17832,htky2l,"It looks like you are [correct](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703). In this study, 95% of biologists agree that a fertilized egg is considered living, and it‚Äôs most reasonable to assume that means that the fertilized egg becomes its own living entity(‚ÄîAs opposed to it simply being ‚Äúalive‚Äù like all human tissue is.) I must have been confusing it with the debate about when the fetus gains full human rights. 

The point at which the fetus would gain full rights is when abortion would be outlawed. The options are (1) immediately after fertilization, (2) when the fetus gains a heartbeat, (3) when the fetus first gains any degree of sentience, (4) when the (arguably nominal) fetus is born, becoming an infant. This is why personhood, or becoming someone, is important regarding this specific debate. Regarding your latter discussion of sentience, infants are sentient and are likely sentient before birth. 

According to the sentience argument, it would be perfectly moral to stop sustaining a human who is biologically alive but brain dead, meaning that the entire brain stopped working with the only working part being the top of the spinal cord leading into the brain that controls breathing, heart activity, etc. The doctor would be justified in terminating that body‚Äôs life support if it is determined that they will never regain higher brain function. At that point, they‚Äôre not a person. They‚Äôre essentially dead except with the body continuing to breathe. The only real argument for keeping the body alive would be that the family is unwilling to let breathing cease because it would represent a ‚Äúmore real‚Äù death than the functional death that has already occurred. All of this to say that sentience makes sense as a determinant of human right status. 

The following argument is ‚ÄúA fetus will soon gain sentience, so they should not be terminated before that.‚Äù The counterargument is that the human fetus has never experienced sentience, and, if you stop its development, never will. The issue is further complicated by the fact that the fetus is using the woman‚Äôs body to grow, effectively waiving her right to control what happens to our body. Ultimately, it boils down to the morality of preventing the development of sentience is a currently non-sentient and never before sentient entity, which is a philosophical problem that could be analyzed with various approaches like consequentialism, deontology, utilitarianism, etc. I‚Äôd go through those, but this comment is getting quite long."
17833,htky2l,"Conservatives donate predominately, more than 60%, to religious organizations. That almost never helps a baby born anywhere, unless of course they are born within that religious sect. 

Voting helps EVERYONE, self sacrifice helps only who you give money too. 

Aside from that, you seem to think donating is the way to show care for someone or something when it‚Äôs not. If a baby is born to unfit parents, you will still fight for their life, and as soon as that baby is born you turn a blind eye. An unborn child‚Äôs life is no more important than chicken eggs you eat, or the meat you buy from the store. The child has no life, because it isn‚Äôt a child."
17834,htky2l,"I‚Äôm also a huge advocate for adoption. But the problem I see is you cannot support adoption and be pro life, because you should be aware of the statistics.

Children are overwhelmingly looked at to be adopted, but once a certain age is reached they rarely do. 62% of children put up for adoption actually get adopted every year, that‚Äôs 38% that don‚Äôt. 

The goal of an animal shelter isn‚Äôt to keep the animals coming for adoption, it‚Äôs to lessen the population of stray dogs or to rehome. Imagine if people kept saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt spat or neuter, keep them coming‚Äù. That‚Äôs the same as pro life."

My point I was making is if you argue every ‚Äúbaby‚Äù is sacred, and they all deserve to live regardless of the circumstances of their birth, than YES you should be willing to pay for them u til they‚Äôre 18 because YOU decided that life was WORTH IT.

17837,htky2l,Exactly
17838,htky2l,That scenario would make sense if the mom is going to die if she doesn‚Äôt abort the kid which in my opinion the mother should have an abortion if her life is on the line. But I don‚Äôt support it if you just want an abortion because the kid is an inconvenience for you.
17839,htky2l,"The bodily autonomy argument I see. This is why this argument doesn‚Äôt work. The way you have laid it out, I have two objections. 

(1) The unborn child was placed in the dependent and vulnerable position in the womb not due to the will of their own but by the direct actions of their parents. Thus the mother must cause the child to require organ or blood donation. She is the reason her child needs the organ donation. 

(2) Everyone has an obligation not to intentionally kill. If an individual is not protecting themselves in self defence then they have an obligation to not to take another life. They can still kill but then they can be justifiably prosecuted by the law for doing so.

Thus you have to change the scenario to make it more comparable to abortion. First, I would have to be the who requires the kidney donation. And I would desperately require the kidney donation because my mother stabbed me. Hence she is directly responsible for my position. She has an obligation not to kill me. If she refuses to donate her kidneys, she can do that. But that also means she is responsible for my death and the individual who killed me, the doctor, can be charged with murder."

17844,htky2l,"Thank for you being a reasonable voice in here. Somewhat ironically to what I'm about to say, this is why I frequently don't bother getting into the abortion debate anymore. I personally feel it should be legalized. But the obvious impasse in this whole debate is whether you think it's murder or not.

I don't think that most people arguing against it are doing so to gain control over women's bodies the way you frequently see being used as a talking point. I think that's a bit of a doomsday, tinfoil-hat way of seeing it. It blatantly ignores Occam's Razor to suggest that argument. In most people's cases it comes down to murder, full stop. 

Regardless of how we each interpret sentience and lifehood, if at the end of the day you think it's murder and I dont think it's murder, how can we ever come to a compromise on that? That's the impasse of the abortion debate. I genuinely dont know how we can ever find a happy compromise for both sides under that condition.

I'm not angry at pro-lifers for believing that. I'm only angry at the ones who refuse safety nets for children who are born into situations that I personally believe they would've been better off never coming into in the first place, but that's a different argument altogether. But for believing that it's murder? I can't be angry at that. I understand where the belief is coming from. I'd be appalled too if someone suggested that you could legally murder your neighbor down the street just because you don't like him. Obviously that's not ok. From my (admittedly anecdotal) experience arguing this point, it seems like a binary difference, a 1 or a 0, it's murder or it isn't. How can we ever compromise when one side believes that abortion is like killing your neighbor and the other side doesn't? They are two fundamentally, ideologically, and diametrically opposed opinions.

I know it's a bit of a defeatist attitude, but it's the conclusion I've reached after years of having a strong opinion on it...like everyone does. How can anyone bridge that gap?"
17845,htky2l,"Well, ok - perhaps not completely fool proof worded, but ofcourse developed consciousness does not equal fully developed. People in a coma still have a developed consciousness, as do children and mentally challenged people. It is just still in further development. I guess you know what I mean here. Either way - the implications of this are not lost to me and in countries in the EU it is for example reasonable to stop life support for people in the hospital that don't have any brain activity anymore. 

I guess abortion will always remain a topic of discussion and it's good to keep discussing it, e.g. during children's education. Make it clear that it is not something to be taken lightly, educate them with all the alternative family planning methods such as the pill, condoms etc. It has been brought up by some people here and I very much agree that alternative measures are very much preferred to an abortion. My opinion is; make sure people don't need it and educate them so that they won't take it lightly and rely on it, but keep it available for if they do need it."
17846,htky2l,"I agree, that it‚Äôs selfish, but consider the following: Would you be willing to donate blood regularly? I know it‚Äôs an inconvenience but you WILL save lives if you do it, Especially if you have one of the rarer blood types. This isn‚Äôt a gotcha. Alternatively if you‚Äôd be willing to take a small risk and suffer a larger physical inconvenience please look into live donor liver donation. Potential liver  transplant patients have a high mortality rate while waiting on the transplant list in USA

Americans choose not to inconvenience themselves all the time, even though sometimes it leads to people dying. Wasn‚Äôt the argument from the left that a few months of inconvenience (quarantine) would save lives? People can argue that time after time, but when it comes to my body, I‚Äôd like to have the final say in what is in or comes out of it. If  we let the government decide what goes on in our bodies then we are taking a step closer to communist China, where being an organ donor is mandatory, and all the awful things that come with our autonomy being taken away. 

I want to stress that I agree that morally it is right to carry a child of rape to term, but it is not something that I think the government should force on us."

17848,htky2l,"I only stated that to show how the comment you made about 80% of people agree that biologists should be the ones to make the decision since this group would include people who don‚Äôt care about their opinions on other subjects - Like wearing a mask for covid to protect other lives.

Nothing I said makes me think I‚Äôm equipped to make a decision for someone‚Äôs body and an experience they have to go through...which is my whole angle. Let them do what they want to do and give them a chance to make a decision. Having unprotected sex shouldn‚Äôt force you down a certain path. Not to mention the whole aspect of rape and having to keep a baby...I said a few months to generalize and meant that they should have a certain period of time to make a decision.

I'm trying to be a reasonable voice, but I'm also trying to respect the community I'm commenting in, so my views on abortion as a left leaning liberal (in the international meaning of the term) will stay personal; though they can be inferred. 

I will also not comment on the origins of the anti-abortive stance in the USA.

What I will say is that the existence of echo chambers drives divisiveness, reinforces biases via confirmation, and generally degrades into a shouting match with both sides being further entrenched in their beliefs. 

What I do firmly believe in is that the only way to govern is to compromise. I'm not a proponent of horseshoe theory, but I am one of duality: Extremes to the exclusion of any other possibility are dangerous. Pure capitalism eats its young. Pure socialism needs all men to be angels. 

So no: There is no possibility to have both sides be happy on the argument of abortion, so long as one side has a diametrically opposed opinion. What can be reached is a compromise position until one side or the other comes to accept the others opinion, or the opinion of the minority becomes so small as to be irrelevant. 

This has already happened on things like Child Labor Laws. There was initial, strong public outcry from one side that children were being treated inhumanely, were being tortured and sacrificed to the machine of industry. The other side argued that children were a necessary economic producer, that they had a worthy trade, that it was no different than history had always shown it to be: Children worked to help their parents survive. 

There were heated arguments on this in the US for a long time. Now child labor advocates represent such a small minority as to be laughable.

You do not care about every living person. In fact, I‚Äôd go out on a limb and say you don‚Äôt care about anyone other then your immediate circle. Sitting there and forcing a teenager, or an extremely poor couple to have a child is by all means abuse. You essentially ruin their life, AND the quality of life for the child because of your own personal beliefs.

My guy, linking me a Christian website with pro life statistics mean absolutely nothing. If you used your noggin you‚Äôd understand that there is no definite answer or consensus of when life begins. What most ACTUAL scientists say is follow the milestones. https://www.lifemattersww.org/Need-Help/Questions-about-abortion/When-Does-Life-Begin
It is your BELIEF that life begins at conception and that is totally fine, I respect your opinion. But it is, an OPINION. 

Opinion is not a governing device and should never be considered one. You fail to understand that when you try and force your opinion on someone else, you ignore theirs. You are not more important than anyone else, so why should your opinion be worth more? Because you really really think so? Riddle me that one."

>Voting is your civic duty and constitutional duty as an American, so yes it is MUCH more important than donating.

I didn't say more important, I said morally better. 

>Donating is a way to clear your conscious of the shit you ignore on a daily basis. Unless you get out of your car or workplace and put money in the hands of specific organizations, you cannot claim your money actually helps them as evidenced above.

Donating is a way to help people when you can't personally help them. Sure, working for a charity or something similar is more admirable, but to claim donating to charity is useless is just wrong.

>You do not care about every living person

You don't know me and cannot make such a claim

>Sitting there and forcing a teenager, or an extremely poor couple to have a child is by all means abuse. You essentially ruin their life, AND the quality of life for the child because of your own personal beliefs.

I'm not forcing anyone to have a child, that responsibility falls to those who decided to have sex. All I want is to prevent people from killing innocent children.

>My guy, linking me a Christian website with pro life statistics mean absolutely nothing.

Maybe if you actually read the article, you'd see that it is not on a Christian website (there are even other articles on the site in support of abortion) and that the author's intent is to find common ground in the abortion debate. Just because you don't like the statistics doesn't mean you can just ignore them. 

>If you used your noggin you‚Äôd understand that there is no definite answer or consensus of when life begins. What most ACTUAL scientists say is follow the milestones.

Bullshit. As I showed above, there is a clear consensus among biologists that human life begins at conception, despite the fact that most of those biologists also describe themselves as pro-choice.

>https://www.lifemattersww.org/Need-Help/Questions-about-abortion/When-Does-Life-Begin

Not sure what you're trying to do by linking a pro-life website.

>It is your BELIEF that life begins at conception and that is totally fine, I respect your opinion. But it is, an OPINION. 

Again, it's a scientific fact that life behind at conception, not just my opinion.

You are not more important than anyone else, so why should your opinion be worth more? Because you really really think so? Riddle me that one.

I'm not talking about certain death in this case. Lets say for the sake of argument the doctor says it's a 10% increase in chance of death over the length of the pregnancy.

17903,htky2l,"Murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another person. You could make the argument that abortion technically isn't murder because it's not illegal, but I would argue that it is murder because it should be illegal. The death penalty, however, is without a doubt NOT murder. The person killed has been found guilty of some heinous crime and the judicial system has decreed that they should be killed for the good of society. Personally I believe the death penalty should be ended because we have the resources to safely separate the guilty party from the rest of society, but it is a fact of linguistics that it is not murder."

There are so many factors to how sentences are put forth and could range from evidence, circumstances, intent, officer reports and so many other factors.  


This is a very childish outlook on the justice system."
18032,ipxyl8,"I agree. The thing is, at this point if we tried to make the police force financially responsible, they'll likely just say they can't do it and go begging for funding. Or it would make things even worse and instead of them using it as an incentive to be more peaceful when possible, the bad ones will just get worse and lean into those harmful policies and behaviors bc they're now even more accountable to themselves. A bit like private prisons.

 I like the idea, but reforms would likely have to be carried out first in order it for it to be ultimately successful"
18033,ipxyl8,"Ok so then white lives matter isn‚Äôt an ideology then by your standards.  Edit: guess I can lump in all lives matter as well. 

You say BLM isn‚Äôt an ideology then proceed to say look into their ideology. Which is it, a slogan or ideology? 

I asked that question because of your previous comment. I was merely trying to grasp what ideas you have towards the two ‚Äúslogans‚Äù"
18034,ipxyl8,For sure the most important thing that needs to change is police unions. They keep bad cops in and ruin the entire force‚Äôs reputation and actually harms citizens
18035,ipxyl8,[deleted]
18036,ipxyl8,"Yeah people over there downvoting me thinking I didn‚Äôt care what the other dude said. Black lives matter, racism is bad, killing is bad, are not ideologies. They‚Äôre just statements."
18037,i4yn4l,"Kind of off topic, but I went to a coffee place today and saw that they had a bulletin board full of people who wrote their names down to thank the local police for their service. Made my day."
18038,i4yn4l,"Serious question. Why do we care if players kneel? I served in the Air Force and I love the fact that me and my brothers fought for freedoms amongst others. I don‚Äôt agree with kneeling, but I accept it‚Äôs apart of their rights as an American. I‚Äôm seriously at a loss, any answers help."
18039,i4yn4l,Freedom of speech is one of America‚Äôs core values. Be it kneeling or drinking a big gulp l!
18040,i4yn4l,"Potentially unpopular opinion: I see nothing wrong with kneeling for the anthem. I find it to be a respectful way to show displeasure with the state of our country. Does it help anything? Admittedly, no. But at least it‚Äôs not hurting anyone."
18041,i4yn4l,I got to ask why do we care so much if football players take a knee during football games. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs taking additional time away from anyone or hurting anyone.
18042,i4yn4l,Both instances are pictures of patriotism.
18043,i4yn4l,"I used to watch sports almost every night. I live in Texas and I am a huge Cowboys fan a fan of all our local teams actually. But then COVID hit and we shutdown and for months there were no sports. So I had dinner every night at the table with my family, read to my son before bed and spent more time with my wife. I haven‚Äôt watched a single game now that sports are back. If you are that entitled and you view me as racist because I don‚Äôt believe the pledge is the time to protest I have better things to do. I‚Äôm not giving that much time money and effort to something that will not help me in anyway."
18044,i4yn4l,"It‚Äôs a free country they can stand sit kneel or whatever they want, I don‚Äôt care and neither should you, stop being a snowflake"
18045,i4yn4l,"Supporting one‚Äôs country means doing everything you can to improve it, no?"
18046,i4yn4l,If you care about people kneeing you‚Äôre a ‚Äòsnowflake‚Äô. There I said it.
18047,i4yn4l,This is so silly! Americans who kneel don‚Äôt hate America! You‚Äôre missing the point!
18048,i4yn4l,I‚Äôm sick of the politicization of everything in our culture. I see the kneeling as a ‚Äúmy agenda is more important than this country‚Äù. Athletes are the privileged class and have opportunity to speak out anytime they want. But the national anthem which used to be a sign of unity has been hijacked and has become another sign of disunity. #abetterlifewithoutsports
18049,i4yn4l,"You can kneel and love America like wtf they just want cops to quit killing black people, it's not complicated."
18050,i4yn4l,Why is protesting considered hatred for America? They are simply pursuing an end to perceived inequality and lack of equity
18051,i4yn4l,"Serious question, what alternative would you prefer for them to peacefully protest instead?"
18052,i4yn4l,At my old elementary school they made you sit down for it but I always stood up because I was always told it‚Äôs the respectful thing to do for my grandparents who fought for this country and for the people who fought for our right. And he used to ground me
18053,i4yn4l,It's good we live in a country where we are free to do both.
18054,i4yn4l,Screw them! The are ruining their brand and don‚Äôt seem to care.
18055,i4yn4l,Look at those assholes with their pained expressions! Fuck off!
18056,i4yn4l,God bless this man. A true patriot.
18057,i4yn4l,Goddamnit who cares
18058,i4yn4l,"Patriotism is kneeling or standing because you know what that flag stands for, and part of it is the freedom of not fearing to kneel or speak up in something you believe in."
18059,i4yn4l,"If lebron really cared about slavery and human rights. Then why does he get sponsored by Nike which literally runs sweatshops
I don't know why this is being downvoted I am stating a literal fact"
18060,i4yn4l,üá∫üá∏
18061,i4yn4l,I choose not to be offended.
18062,i4yn4l,Lmao if you think kneeling means don't love America your retarded
18063,i4yn4l,"Average NFL salary is $2.7 million.
That cop does not get paid $27K/year."
18064,i4yn4l,It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre retarded guy. Way easier becoming a cop than it is to become a football player. Simple supply and demand.
18065,i4yn4l,I will never feel sorry for millionaires that think their fans mistreat them.  You are not essential workers. You are about to find out how unimportant you really are. The white racist rednecks ~~are~~ were your number one fans.
18066,i4yn4l,Lol. Right
18067,i4yn4l,I wouldn't say its 100x tougher.... but different. And deserves respect.
18068,i4yn4l,Funny because the reason we stand for the flag and anthem is because our founding fathers didn't want us to kneel to the government loom at them now. Lmao
18069,i4yn4l,Ironic team name
18070,i4yn4l,"If Americans truly believed in ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù and the right to one‚Äôs own opinion, they would be supporting these people‚Äôs right to protest. You don‚Äôt have to agree, but let‚Äôs not bash people for doing something that is causing no harm to others."
18071,i4yn4l,"Idk kneeling seems like a fine protest. The ability to express your first amendment right peacefully is one of the best things about America. But also, I don't think the cop's job is 100X harder than a professional athlete. NFL players train intensely for years, deal with constant public spotlight, and run the risk of injuries which can end their career."
18072,i4yn4l,I'm a patriots fan and it is sad to see my favorite team brainwashed
18073,i4yn4l,"I don't even watch most if not all big time American sports like baseball, football, and hockey. I was very active in sports and physical activities through college. I am a very active person now but don't play sports for any team anymore. I only really get involved in and watch the olympics but that is about it. 

&#x200B;

Playing sports is a completely different thing. Much better. These professional sports dudes don't deserve to get paid as much as they do. They do it for ""entertainment"" purposes only."
18074,i4yn4l,"Don‚Äôt care if they want to kneel or if they hate America. They‚Äôre entitled to their opinion. Just don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs relevant to sports. If someone was kneeling to Trump or blaring any right wing opinion during a game it‚Äôd be just as annoying, because no one cares about your political opinion, they just want to watch the game."
18075,i4yn4l,"Yeah, but NFL players tend to get penalized for unnecessary roughness a lot more than cops do."
18076,i4yn4l,Isn‚Äôt bending the knee more respectful to the country? Most of the fans in the stands don‚Äôt even bother to take their hats off
18077,i4yn4l,I'm speechless God bless America !!!üá∫üá∏
18078,i4yn4l,"Love this photo! It‚Äôs worth 1,000 words."
18079,i4yn4l,Kneelers should have to suck a dick when they do it cause that's what they're going to be doing if another country invades us.
18080,i4yn4l,They‚Äôre getting paid to protest too. Complete frauds.
18081,i4yn4l,"Athletes in general are not very bright and are used to being told what to do. Especially football. Those guys just want to play. There is someone telling them to kneel. They‚Äôre not doing it on their own. Maybe a few of them like Colin, who are eccentric and like attention. But the vast majority are just following orders and going with the team."
18082,i4yn4l,Yea he only kneels if there's a black man under him
18083,i4yn4l,Patriots. Oh the irony. Used to be a Pats fan. Now I‚Äôm done with the NFL.
18084,i4yn4l,"Nice to say that American Football players don't respect and care for America, even though they stand in honor every game when the National Anthem starts. 

I'd say that a person who shoots and murders people for a living compared to Sports players isn't a real evaluation."
18085,i4yn4l,"Millionaires and in Oprah's case, billionaires are oppressed in the USA. What a time to be a live. Oprah has it harder than the inner cities and trailer parks. Must be hard when you have the 2019 Bugatti and not the 2020."
18086,i4yn4l,"Knock their pay down, and see if they start standing, ass holes!"
18087,i4yn4l,Agreed! NFL is trash now!
18088,i4yn4l,Makes sense since everyone is in the nfl and only about two thousand cops in the world.
18089,i4yn4l,"Hey kneel or stand, at least they‚Äôre showing respect."
18090,i4yn4l,Scum
18091,i4yn4l,"I watch the NHL now, as far as I know only a few chuckle buckets got played. Until that ridiculous Shit is removed I'm boycotting The NBA MLB and NFL. They can all suck a BBC for all I care."
18092,i4yn4l,"the cop has white privilege, remember?"
18093,i4yn4l,Sports is a joke and direct result of Idealogical Subversion that has taken over our education system. Jist look at these halftards....
18094,i4yn4l,Imo many people show patriotism in different ways.Kneeling before a flag us ally means you are under or accept the flag
18095,i4yn4l,He also sees the worst of America while they see the best
18096,i4yn4l,That‚Äôs awesome dude üëç
18097,i4yn4l,"I‚Äôm glad to see you, among some other commenters, understand that it is their right. I don‚Äôt fully agree with them, but I will support their right to protest."
18098,i4yn4l,"Patriotism is kneeling or standing because you know what that flag stands for, and part of it is the freedom of not fearing to kneel or speak up in something you believe in."
18099,i4yn4l,"I personally don't agree with it, but I do support free speech/protest so yes it is 100% acceptable. I think I a lot of people care so much because of the sacrifices people made in order for them to protest in the first place. I draw the line at having separate national anthems. Some people on the left were advocating for a ""black national anthem"". I feel like this would divide the country even more than it already is."
18100,i4yn4l,"It's one of the most ironic things ever when Conservatives get upset over the idea of free speech, and it seems to happen all the time now. It may just be that the pro-censorship conservatives are just much more vocal."
18101,i4yn4l,"Some people think it's truly a big deal, it's beyond me"
18102,i4yn4l,"I‚Äôm in the same position I don‚Äôt agree with the kneeling but it doesn‚Äôt bother me if someone kneels because what they‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt negatively affecting my life unless I let it by getting upset and creating enemies and arguments over something so minor. This is the big problem I see in the world today is the person with the opinion that doesn‚Äôt align is seen as an enemy. everything is so divided in the world now people seem to forget that no matter who gets elected, how people protest, what religion someone believes in, etc. that we are all apart of a bigger picture and in that together."
18103,i4yn4l,"Conservative here, fully agree.  100% constitutional and a peaceful demonstration to boot.  I have zero problem with players kneeling during the national anthem in protest.  Peaceful protest is the most american thing we can do and support around the globe."
18104,i4yn4l,"Not eveyone is open minded as you are. Its great to see military people this open minded. Some people i guess just dont like other people expressing themselves in a way thats not ""normal"". But whos is to say what normal is if everyone thinks differently. People are trained to follow not think. Those that think usually become outcast seems like. Thank you for your service"
18105,i4yn4l,The problem is that they are doing their political protests on their bosses time and money. If I were to do the same thing at my work they would be entirely within their rights to tell me to stop it and discipline right up to firing me. If they did it on their own time it would still be douchey but it would be more understandable.
18106,i4yn4l,"Youre right they have a 100% right to kneel... 12yrs USMC... BUT just because you have the right doesnt make it right... I can screan the ""N"" word outside wherever i want doesnt make it right... Also rights go both ways... You can be a disrespectful aaahole and take a knee well i can have a Confederate statue in a public park... This is where i have issues... RIGHTS mean RIGHTS for EVERYONE not just what Liberals or Conservatives see fit to produce as their own... This kneeling is designed to break the spirr of America..."
18107,i4yn4l,Because they are protesting the very concept and symbolism which provides them with that right. In terms of the law of course it‚Äôs their right unless NFL or any other business created policy against it. Socially anti-American movements aren‚Äôt harmless. Watch Yuri Bezmenov‚Äôs videos on ideological subversion. He was a propaganda and psychological warfare expert for the KGB and an intelligence officer in Bangladesh and India.
18108,i4yn4l,"Stand for the Flag, kneel for the Cross. 

They kneel for the Flag, and vandalize the cross.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt mean that rioters are actually vandalizing the Cross, I just used it as a way to say they‚Äôre vandalizing a ton of things. My apologies."
18109,i4yn4l,"I agree that they have the right to kneel, but their reasons for doing so are absolute bullshit. 

These athletes are living proof that America is not systemically racist, but rather the land of opportunity for all people regardless of race.

I support ones freedom until it infringes on my freedom. While kneeling doesn‚Äôt directly infringe on my freedom, they kneel in support of a cause that wants to take away freedoms we have in this country, and I am vehemently opposed to that. At that point, you‚Äôre a domestic enemy of this country."
18110,i4yn4l,So you accept it but do you like it?
18111,i4yn4l,They dont have the right to protest their eyes. By reframing thier protest they can attack that instead looking racist.  Its transparent
18112,i4yn4l,Seconded. It's a fantastic example of free speech and hating on the people who do it is equally unhelpful. Just breeds hate
18113,i4yn4l,For me it‚Äôs because of the hypocrisy. You have these people like Colin Kaepernick who believe they are opposed yet they drive around in super cars and have mansions. They aren‚Äôt oppressed but they want you to believe they are
18114,i4yn4l,It‚Äôs not about feelings. It‚Äôs about people who fought for our country. No one else oppressed.
18115,i4yn4l,Its about respecting the country that gave these football players the opportunity to become millionaries while doing the thing they love.
18116,i4yn4l,Keep politics out of sports.
18117,i4yn4l,"I hear you dude. I‚Äôm unmarried without kids so far, but all this covid nonsense has really sucked the wind out of sports for me, I lived and breathed for baseball season and the way sports has been tainted now I just can‚Äôt find any enthusiasm for it. But the bright side, like you touched on, is kind of a reminder of where the truly valuable things in life are: time spent with family (parents and sibling in my case), time spent improving my interior life, time spent appreciating things I might‚Äôve taken for granted in the past."
18118,i4yn4l,[deleted]
18119,i4yn4l,"Well said friend. I‚Äôm in the same boat and was a huge Packer‚Äôs fan. Got totally turned off by this BS.  

I read an article this week where the President of the Packers said something along the lines of ‚ÄúBLM isn‚Äôt a Marxist group and it‚Äôs important to support the protests. These traitors don‚Äôt deserve a penny more from us. They can rot IMO."
18120,i4yn4l,"They do have the constitutional right to kneel yes, but the viewers can protest by not watching and voicing their opinions. Quit being a piece of shit hypocrite. Y'all can bicker and whine all day but once the other side does even a smidge of what you do, you're up in arms."
18121,i4yn4l,"It sure is a free country and people are also free to criticize actions they don‚Äôt agree with whoever is doing it.  So, snowflake, get over it.  Multi-millionaires aren‚Äôt above criticism just because they are good at professional sports."
18122,i4yn4l,"Kneeling got politicized to a nuclear level immediately, and the message was lost to a lot of people.

Now the news only plays the soundbites of the worst sides to each story."
18123,i4yn4l,"The hypocrisy is what gets me, a lot of these folks don't give a shit about poor people, especially poor blacks. For instance, you think Lebron gives a fuck about slavery or what black folks go through? Lebron Zedong is a just a prime example lmao. Think man."
18124,i4yn4l,He also funded a school for the unfortunate
18125,i4yn4l,Quite certain the cop makes more than that.
18126,i4yn4l,50 x then. The point still stands
18127,i4yn4l,"These athletes attending college.

Officers, military members and a vast majority of ‚Äúprofessionals ‚Äú are use to being told what to do. I‚Äôm sure you are too.

You think they‚Äôre all being told to kneel? They travel together, they practice together, they work together. How do you figure they don‚Äôt genuinely want to kneel?"
18128,i4yn4l,"99% of cops never use their weapon in the line of duty, and most cops never want to harm another person. That hardly qualifies as ‚Äúshooting and murdering people for a living.‚Äù"

18130,i4yn4l,It‚Äôs basic disrespect and the players know that.
18131,i4yn4l,"Because none of these players grew up in the projects right? None grew up dirt poor in bad neighborhoods. That‚Äôs the best of America, you‚Äôre right. Such a stupid take."
18132,i4yn4l,"See, I‚Äôm with you, they totally have a right to protest and I‚Äôll support that right. However I still have a right to not support the protest itself and even tell them to end it. As long as it‚Äôs not a mandate its ok to discourage bad uses of free speech."
18133,i4yn4l,"Well, it is a private business so they can say you will stand or you re fired. 

That said, I have stopped watching sports over it and so has my family (except my brother but he trains a lot of the players for a sport)."
18134,i4yn4l,"The irony is that Colin Kaepernick initially sat down during the national anthem to protest, but he was contacted by a marine who said it was disrespectful to the flag, and he should kneel instead of sitting down.


You‚Äôre a hypocrite if you get your undies in a bunch because some dude is kneeling. Let him be, it‚Äôs his right to do whatever he wants."
18135,i4yn4l,"Idiots will call for idiotic things. A single national anthem is enough, whether you‚Äôre protesting or not. 

If the NFL itself wanted to fire the players for going against their rules then they‚Äôre well within their rights to do so. They aren‚Äôt. They understand it‚Äôs a tricky situation and protesting by taking a knee during their work hours is a way to get national coverage... immediately. So I understand why they choose to do so at the games, and I also understand the consequences (if any do arise) can come at any time. I may not agree with the vehemence against kneeling, but what is a society that doesn‚Äôt follow its own rules?"
18136,i4yn4l,"That was only for a week, so it‚Äôs pointless to even start if you are gonna keep it permanently. That‚Äôs when you realize they just wanna"
18137,i4yn4l,"If it's their right to protest, then is it not my right to criticize them? Or is this rock paper scissors, and their right to protest beats my right to free speech?"
18138,i4yn4l,"I haven‚Äôt seen any conservatives that think they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to kneel legally. A few think the nfl should prohibit it, but most think they should be able to do it but it‚Äôs disrespectful. I honestly don‚Äôt see anything hypocritical."
18139,i4yn4l,Yeah you definitely hit the nail on the head with that one. Most of my buddies while we served didn‚Äôt give two shits about that kindve stuff. But thank you for the kind words!
18140,i4yn4l,But then the question rises: why do people care what others' bosses allow them to do? It's different everywhere.
18141,i4yn4l,"The kneeling is designed to point out issues in America to make it better those issues being not everyone is truly treated equally in America like our founding fathers wanted, but confederate status is promoting the conferency and a government that literally was meant to separate and break up America....."
18142,i4yn4l,Wait are you equating kneeling during the Sky Fairy Bless America song with saying the N word? What the fuck is wrong with you? Who hurt you?
18143,i4yn4l,I can think of one group that vandalized crosses ü§î
18144,i4yn4l,Who vandalizes the cross?
18145,i4yn4l,"I already said I do not agree with kneeling, but it is their right to do so."
18146,i4yn4l,"I fought for this country, was wounded in action for this country, and sacrificed for this country. I, and my closest friends who served with me, don‚Äôt care if they kneel (anecdotal of course). 

Do I think it‚Äôs right? No. But They‚Äôre calling attention is problems in America. Great. This is how discussions begin and problems get solved.

Find another excuse than ‚Äúit‚Äôs about people who fought for this country‚Äù"
18147,i4yn4l,Kneeling during the anthem has nothing to do with people who fought in the U.S. Army.
18148,i4yn4l,This country also allows them to kneel. I really don‚Äôt take any offense or care what players do during to the anthem.
18149,i4yn4l,"Are they not allowed to voice their personal dissatisfaction and disappointment of the country they live in? 
Didn‚Äôt this country fight for that very right? And now people are criticizing those who exercise that right. 

That seems pretty convoluted to me."
18150,i4yn4l,[removed]
18151,i4yn4l,"Or, here's a thought, we look at the issue that they are actually kneeling in protest for: police killing black people. That's what needs to be discussed, not ""ermahgerd they aren't standing for murica song"""

18153,i4yn4l,"I don‚Äôt have a problem with kneeling. I don‚Äôt have a problem with people who have a problem with kneeling. Both are using freedom of expression. I only have a problem with people asking the NBA, NFL, etc. to ban the kneeling."

18159,i4yn4l,like i said its my opinion on this take.
18160,i4yn4l,Yeah people like Kap experienced so much poverty while being adopted by a rich white family. This was of course after his black parents abandoned him.
18161,i4yn4l,‚Äúbad uses of free speech‚Äù is starting to sound like speech you disagree with.
18162,i4yn4l,"I agree with it being a private business and they have certain exceptions, but it gets tricky. We know we‚Äôve seen our fair share of censorship on both Facebook and YouTube, both of which are publicly traded companies. At times, the argument for it being a private business falls short imo."
18163,i4yn4l,"Dis you notice that no one cares that you‚Äôre not watching? That you had to announce it to feel special, AND STILL, no one cares?"
18164,i4yn4l,"> Well, it is a private business so they can say you will stand or you re fired.

Isn‚Äôt that as bad as leftist cancel culture?"

18170,i4yn4l,KKK
18171,i4yn4l,"100% this. I think it‚Äôs important to realize that the reason Colin decided to do it was to bring awareness to an issue he believes is plaguing America. 

Personally, I think we should be beyond this stage by now and move on to true action items since people are aware of the issue (whether they want to admit it is an issue or not). 

A collaborative effort to work through police reform nationwide would be the next stage, imo."
18172,i4yn4l,"And allows us to reject it. No question that they should be allowed to kneel, but morally it is backward imo."
18173,i4yn4l,They aren't being arrested? Like why can't people criticize it? Nobody is calling for them to be legally forced to stand up. People the have the right to disagree with it and voice that disagreement.
18174,i4yn4l,I never said they arent allowed to do that. My dad fought to protect the rights of every American citizen .
18175,i4yn4l,Take it outside. Keep it out of sports.
18176,i4yn4l,I said its America which gave them the opportunity
18177,i4yn4l,I disagree that black people are being targeted and killed by police simply for being black.

18179,i4yn4l,For sure it is if you say so ü•¥
18180,i4yn4l,"the term is accurate, it also shows you don‚Äôt have a legitimate response so you try to call me names?  Haha. I may be a Boomer but your intellect is pathetic. Haha"
18181,i4yn4l,I don't think the boomers care as much about this trend as everyone thinks they do.
18182,i4yn4l,"Thank you. This is the danger of the echo chamber. Everything he said was factually incorrect but since it conforms to a predetermined narrative there is no scrutiny.

My take away from his comment is that he thinks LeBron can't be compassionate or care about others because he is a successful (black) man."
18183,i4yn4l,YOU do some research you dumbass. Lebron Zedong's comments speak volumes and the fact that there are little girls in China making his expensive ass shoes then he goes off about slavery. Like really?
18184,i4yn4l,Yeah that's pretty bad
18185,i4yn4l,More than. I make minimum ($13/hr) which comes out to about $23K.
18186,i4yn4l,Would you protect someone using your own life for that price? Would you do it for 52k a year?
18187,i4yn4l,"You picked one player you dislike. This is what normal people call cherry picking. What about the other 2,500 players? Or the other thousands upon thousands that have been in and out of the league the last 20 years? You‚Äôre stupidity and racism is incredible but not at all surprising."
18188,i4yn4l,Not on reddit tho lol
18189,i4yn4l,"1. The issue with FB and Twitter is they claim to be a Platform and not a Publisher. They enjoy immunity that the NYT, WP, and you don‚Äôt get. They get the best of both worlds. That is the issue. Their immunity should be revoked yesterday. 

2. Remember when everyone was totally cool with Tim Tebow taking a knee? Me neither."
18190,i4yn4l,Not really the same as employees... I would expect and have no problem with someone being fired for wearing a MAGA hat to work.
18191,i4yn4l,"No, it isn‚Äôt. If it was, wouldn‚Äôt that mean giving a dress code is cancel culture?"

I know just as well not to wear my BLM or pride shit when I go to the flea market with my dad in central Florida. Not because I can't, but because I don't want to deal with the hassle."
18194,i4yn4l,TRUE
18195,i4yn4l,I know some people care I‚Äôm just not one of them. For one protesting is a very american thing and exercising your right to protest against the anthem or not should be considered patriotic and not frowned upon. And if I recall correctly I believe it was a veteran who told kap to kneel since it‚Äôs more respectful than sitting on the bench.
18196,i4yn4l,Peacefull protest is immoral?
18197,i4yn4l,But you‚Äôre still criticizing their use of it. Why?
18198,i4yn4l,The only way to do that is to completely remove the SSB ritual from the game
18199,i4yn4l,"Despite what you may think, these guys dont owe big daddy State a damn thing."
18200,i4yn4l,Statistics don't care about your agreement. It's happening anyway. I can link the reports if you are interested
18201,i4yn4l,Good grief already. These people are like parasitic robots spewing CNN news bites. His response below is further proof of this.
18202,i4yn4l,"One of the major examples is how black defendants generally get much harsher sentences than white ones for equivalent crimes. Black defendents are also more likely to be presumed guilty by juries due to implicit bias. These are both examples of systemic racism where there isn't necessarily an outright conscious choice to be racist, but they are still problematic if we want a just society. 

Unfortunately, there is no easy solution for this beyond major cultural changes, which will take time."
18203,i4yn4l,"Maybe the obvious stuff like black people being killed for the color of their skin and then the cops not being prosecuted or investigated for their blatant misconduct. Our refusal to provide equity to African Americans in order to help their communities recover from 400 years of oppression. Racial gerrymandering that diminishes the vote of African Americans, as well as voter suppression. Idk just a couple. And there‚Äôs a pattern. These problems stem from our awful job of providing any sort of due process or aid to the African American community that has suffered 400 years of harsh discrimination"
18204,i4yn4l,....where do you get YOUR shoes?
18205,i4yn4l,He can't advocate against what he willingly enables
18206,i4yn4l,No. Do most cops make that little?
18207,i4yn4l,"You assuming that all black NFL player rose from poverty is pretty racist, don‚Äôt you think?

Are poor kids just as rich as white kids, Joe?"
18208,i4yn4l,Reddit is different!! /s
18209,i4yn4l,How would they be a publisher? Literally anyone can post there. A publisher doesnt have the entire population posting on their platform
18210,i4yn4l,Great point to bring up - I didn‚Äôt even consider employees and was thinking about it more on the customer side.
18211,i4yn4l,? His name
18212,i4yn4l,Both instances are examples of others infringing on your rights. Both are examples of what‚Äôs wrong with this country atm.
18213,i4yn4l,Reading isnt your strong suit is it... Again just because you have the right doesnt mean its right... Your fucking rights end at the tip of your nose...
18214,i4yn4l,"What? So we shouldn't criticize people we disagree with? I disagree with what they think they're fighting for and I disagree with the way they're doing it. I'm not asking that they be legally forced to shut up and stand, I'm criticizing their speech with my speech, that is literally how freedom of speech works, that is patriotism. Freedom of speech is not a one way thing, I can criticize what someone says, that is my right. Just because someone is using their freedom of speech doesn't mean I have to back off my criticism."
18215,i4yn4l,And I have equal right to do that.
18216,i4yn4l,"Now you‚Äôre criticizing his speech. According to your terrible logic, you hate free speech."
18217,i4yn4l,[deleted]
18218,i4yn4l,Statiatics say the opposite but ok.
18219,i4yn4l,"Yeah but tbh I‚Äôm too damn exhausted mentally to even try to debate the topic, so I‚Äôm just going to get their opinion and move on."
18220,i4yn4l,Lol this whole thing is just so wrong
18221,i4yn4l,And no white dude has been killed by the cops in the history...
18222,i4yn4l,sure and what are your proposed solutions to these problems? I just want to get your full picture here.
18223,i4yn4l,Omg you got me so good you're so smart!!! It doesn't matter because I don't virtue signal 247 you idiot
18224,i4yn4l,Yup. They save us for that little bit of money. Same with firefighters. Its my opinion that we might be better off paying them more for their sacrifices rather than paying politicians to lie to us to eventually make money off us.
18225,i4yn4l,No because I‚Äôm not assuming all black players rose from poverty. Never said the word black nor did I imply anywhere that that was my position. Never said anything about Biden either. Just shows how extra stupid you are. Can‚Äôt formulate an opinion without someone else telling you to form it first. Reading comprehension is a good skill to have. I can teach you for a small fee if you‚Äôd like. Or you can keep digging into your bag of regurgitated BS to find a better argument.
18226,i4yn4l,"It‚Äôs simple, if you make an editorial decision on what gets published, you become a publisher."
18227,i4yn4l,EXACTLY! What people dont get os however disgusting the statement you are making  is YOU HAVE A FUCKING RIGHT TO SAY IT... Period... Nobody gets to pickn choose this...Or we might as well live in China...but for some idiots i think they need a good dose of China in thier lives...Lets see how they protest when the Socialist govt they dream of hauls their asses to a reeducation camp...
18228,i4yn4l,"Kneel during football flag song or don't. Say the N word or don't. Just don't be surprised at the fallout.

I've seen plenty of NFL boycotts since this all started, and it's matched up pretty well with the bootlickers shitting on protestors, peaceful and nonpeaceful alike. Even when it was peaceful, in places spread out from Minneapolis, the same kneel-opposers shit on the protestors, even though they were exercising their first amendment rights. I participated in peaceful marches in my city and some of the responses I got from family were baffling and infuriating. Like we just walked up the street asking cops not kill black people."
18229,i4yn4l,"I‚Äôm not disagreeing or agreeing with you , I was just stating how I feel. Your criticism is fine and you have the right to criticize."
18230,i4yn4l,Of course. But that does not answer my question. Why do you criticize them for exercising their rights?
18231,i4yn4l,For making their own success? No one helped them do that but themselves. Unlike many other businesses an athlete is alone in their journey and completely alone in their methods for success.

18234,i4yn4l,How so?
18235,i4yn4l,"I didn‚Äôt say that. White people have been killed by cops, yes. But black people are killed at a disproportionate rate in terms to population, and in most cases the deaths are much more malicious on the polices side."
18236,i4yn4l,Call police racist and implement socialism. The solution to every problem.
18237,i4yn4l,"Calling me an idiot helps your argument how? All it does is show how fragile you are bro.


You doing ok?"
18238,i4yn4l,"So you initially called me racist for not talking about the other 2,500 players, but you were referring to white players as well?

So I‚Äôm racist against white, black, and brown NFL players? 

You don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre saying, but you were trying to imply racism. You‚Äôre funny.

Go join the Antifa threads"
18239,i4yn4l,"That is my point. The platform is not designed for that. It is designed for anyone to spread their thoughts no matter how thoughtful and well articulated or inaccurate and moronic. How would it work if they had to review your post before it is public? They are not a publisher, and there is no way it could be."
18240,i4yn4l,"Everything you said is correct, except when ‚Äúthe fallout‚Äù infringes on your rights. Protests and counter protests (what you call bootlickers shitting on) aren‚Äôt a new thing, both are legal and should be acceptable in a free society. The minute it turns violent, with property destruction, vandalism, assault, etc. it is no longer legal because it it infringing on the rights of others. Seems like a lot of people have trouble with 4th grade level civics. Not you, you did it correctly by adhering to the law, but for dozens of protests around the nation this simple fact was overlooked because one side felt they had the right to deny the rights of others."
18241,i4yn4l,"Yes, you did disagree with him as well as this post. 

According to your own logic you‚Äôve used above, you oppose freedom of speech now since you‚Äôre criticizing others‚Äô speech."
18242,i4yn4l,Because its disrespectful. It doesn't make it any less of free speach. Its just imo it's diareapectful. I would personally rather see protests I dont agree with in America with free speach then never seeing them in a country without free speach. In other words I reapect the fact that America has free speech more than I disrespect their protest.
18243,i4yn4l,"I will answer your question, she along with other people are offended by the kneel,due to her respect for the flag, freedom, and her dad she has her rights just like they do.

18248,i4yn4l,Literally everything. Blacks being killed for the color of their skin? By who? Cops? They do get investigated and sentenced for misconduct. Also its been over 150 years since slavery ended slavery is not holding any black person down from achieving their dream whatever that dream may be. Also voter suppression?  What? Literally republicans and democrats fight for your vote. Also slavery in America was about 240 something years no where near 400...
18249,i4yn4l,They also commit disproportionate amounts of crime thus making them have disproportionate interactions with the police thus making the likelihood one of those meetings goes wrong.

18253,i4yn4l,"Again, reading comprehension is important and you clearly don‚Äôt grasp the concept of it. Did I initially call you racist? No. I called you racist because you said kaps black parents abandoned him. Like only black kids are adopted in this world. Showing everyone once again how stupid you are. Stop trying and go choke on trumps balls some more. How are those states rights and low government control going under your supreme leader? Oh yeah, non existent.

18256,i4yn4l,Why is it disrespectful?
18257,i4yn4l,"Actually, I have every right to question them. Whether or not they respond is beyond my control , and solely within their own rights.

Also, it could be deemed unwise to answer for someone else, even if you believe you will give the same answer."
18258,i4yn4l,Do you mind explaining to me what you think their reasoning behind doing it is?
18259,i4yn4l,"Breonna Taylor‚Äôs killer haven‚Äôt been arrested and George Floyd‚Äôs were only arrested because of public outrage. Yeah it has been 150 years since slavery. But you think we set the slaves free and they were all of a sudden on an equal socioeconomic standing with white people? Cause they weren‚Äôt and still aren‚Äôt cause we haven‚Äôt done enough to make up for the impact slavery had. The vast majority of African Americans couldn‚Äôt read when they were freed, they had no job skills for true industrializing world, etc. how can they achieve their dreams if they‚Äôve started from such a poor position and our response is ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre free and ‚Äòtechnically you‚Äôre legally equal‚Äô so you can just as easily become successful as a white person. Slavery‚Äôs affect is holding people back and we‚Äôve done next to nothing to mitigate it. Voter suppression is a very real thing, especially when cops patrol the areas around polling centers in predominately African American communities. And, no, slavery started in 1619 when the first slaves arrived off a boat in Virginia."
18260,i4yn4l,Maybe because African American communities are so economically disadvantaged that the only thing they can do to survive is commit crime. Poverty and crime go hand in hand
18261,i4yn4l,"Cool, man. Nice to see people get irrationally angry over shit like this I guess."
18262,i4yn4l,Because in my opinion it is. You have the right to beleive otherwise
18263,i4yn4l,I just reported you for harassing people you asked her 3 times nobody owes you an answer. Victim #3.
18264,i4yn4l,"First of all it doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I can still criticize it. But right now they're explicitly kneeling for police brutality, more specifically racial police brutality. I've done my research, and I fundamentally disagree with the way they see the police. Based on data, I don't think the way they view the police is correct. I don't even care that much about kneeling. I've never watched football. All I'm saying is that just because someone is exercising their 1st amendment right does not free them from criticism no matter what you believe or what the criticism is. What I think you're trying to say is that it is ironic that people are criticizing someone using free speech. I don't think this is ironic at all. They disagree with what the players are doing, and therefore they criticize the content of the speech not the speech itself."
18265,i4yn4l,"Well tbh after seeing the full unedited footage the cops who arrested floyd aint gunna be convicted of murder. Also your right the slaves were not equal at first, but today in 2020 theres nothing that black people cant do because of slavery, to use that as an excuse for failure is just bullshit. Yes you are on equal footing with whites today. You have to understand the world doesn‚Äôt owe you anything, go out and create your own path in life and work hard to achieve your goals. Yea police patrol those neighborhoods why? Because look at the crime rate in that area simple right? Law enforcement going typically where the law is broken the most? And yes 1619, ended in 1865 thats 246 years."
18266,i4yn4l,"> Breonna Taylor‚Äôs killer haven‚Äôt been arrested 

Why in the world do you think they should be arrested? A victim killed in the crossfire of a shootout has **never** led to the police being arrested, regardless of skin color."
18267,i4yn4l,"Slavery started long before then dude...

Since the dawn of time; people have been forced into servitude against their will.  Taken from their families. Shipped to far off lands to never see their tribe or family again.  Every race, religion and creed has been put into chains at some point or another.  It was the way of the world... and all people of the world know the pain BLM moment is supposedly championing. But just like how I can‚Äôt expect an apology from the Mongols, Moors or the Nodics that raped and enslaved my people, there‚Äôs not a black person living that deserves an apology for something that happened 5 generations ago. Shit blacks aren‚Äôt even the last group of people that have been enslaved in history...


You‚Äôre so hung up on slavery; go after the fucking Chinese. They‚Äôre actively enslaving Muslims in their country; and you want to whine about something that happen in 1619 VA?  Four hundred years ago?!?

Talk about being out of touch with reality."
18268,i4yn4l,">‚ÄúIf we wanted to be serious about evidence, we might compare where blacks stood a hundred years after the end of slavery with where they stood after 30 years of the liberal welfare state,‚Äù Sowell wrote in 2014. ‚ÄúIn other words, we could compare hard evidence on ‚Äòthe legacy of slavery‚Äô with hard evidence on the legacy of liberals.""

>‚Äú**Despite the grand myth that black economic progress began or accelerated with the passage of the civil rights laws and the ‚Äòwar on poverty‚Äô programs, the cold fact is that the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThis was before any of those programs began.""**

>Those years were marked by blacks acting without government assistance. Hundreds of thousands of Southern blacks migrated to the North, where they found jobs and better schools.

>**‚ÄúOver the next 20 years, the poverty rate among blacks fell another 18 percentage points ‚Ä¶ This was a continuation of a previous economic trend, at a slower rate or progress, not the economic grand deliverance proclaimed by liberals and self-serving black ‚Äòleaders.‚Äô‚Äù**

>Sowell has been a senior fellow at Stanford University‚Äôs Hoover Institution since 1980. He retired recently

>Sowell has questioned the effect of the legacy of slavery in the 21st century. ‚ÄúWhether it is the dearth of marriages and the family among contemporary blacks or their lower labor force participation than whites, or their higher crime rates, slavery has often been invoked as an explanation,‚Äù he wrote in his 2005 book, Black Rednecks and White Liberals.

>**‚ÄúYet the fact is that in the late nineteenth century, when blacks were just one generation out of slavery, there was nothing like today‚Äôs levels of unwed births or failure to participate in the labor force,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIt has been from the 1960s onward that these social pathologies have escalated. Whatever the cause, it has arisen long after slavery had ended.‚Äù**

>**The marriage and family data Sowell cites are striking. In 1960, 78% of black children were being raised in two-parent families. ‚ÄúBut thirty years after the liberal welfare state found the great majority of black children being raised by a single parent (66 percent),‚Äù he wrote in 2014.**

It was very satisfying looking back at the empty Goya section as I left the aisle. I was surprised; I thought I was the only Republican w/in 10 square miles. I‚Äôm beginning to think the silent majority is a real thing after all. Now, if only people could unite this way to stop monuments eating dirt."
18319,hqobmb,Sorry for hiding under a rock but what happened with goya
18320,hqobmb,Lazy ass people can‚Äôt make beans!
18321,hqobmb,Popular vote
18322,hqobmb,"Based..?

I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs great because people are buying it or bad because Publix is limiting them...

Eh, Based Shoppers"

18325,hqobmb,What if we don‚Äôt understand?! And are chick peas garbanzo beans? My whole world has been shattered
18326,hqobmb,I would think the opposite. They‚Äôre preventing people from buying more than two.
18327,hqobmb,Completely unrelated to politics. I shop at Publix nearly every day and they have had these signs out since lockdown started.
18328,hqobmb,Yes but I don‚Äôt get how ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù plays into anything. AFAIK liberals make up a larger majority
18329,hqobmb,Wait sorry I‚Äôm kind of confused here. Did I miss something?
18330,hqobmb,"Ha! I intentionally bought their products when I was at the store earlier. I‚Äôve always liked their stuff, but now it‚Äôs even better."
18331,hqobmb,"I bought 4 cans of these yesterday. I‚Äôd never bought this brand before, but noticed the shelf was almost empty when I bought my 4 cans."
18332,hqobmb,This is beyond bizzare
18333,hqobmb,BAM üí• I bought my Goya‚Äôs yesterday üòéüéâ
18334,hqobmb,"My wife attempted to buy anything Goya (we usually get some things of theirs anyhow but I asked her to step it up) and she literally couldn't find anything at all that was I'm stock. This make sense as it was a first rush, the important thing is to KEEP IT UP. Don't forget in 2 weeks or a month. We must show the impact of our force in this country. The silent majority speaks without words."
18335,hqobmb,I often have to remind myself that we ARE still the majority. And not everyone‚Äôs as crazy as the bozos on the good morning show make us out to be...
18336,hqobmb,Gotta love Publix.
18337,hqobmb,The power of love
18338,hqobmb,i wonder if this is the publix i live by
18339,hqobmb,[deleted]
18340,hqobmb,This is to slow the sale of those products........nothing else
18341,hqobmb,I really want to go to the store and just buy up all these items
18342,hqobmb,This is beautiful
18343,hqobmb,Selective much? That sign is posted on all canned vegetables at Publix. For months now. It has absolutely nothing to do with boycotting Goya.

18348,hqobmb,"Just making a joke here, but since the right are eating up all the Goya, despite the left being so triggered you could say we're the ones who are salty"

18361,hqobmb,Are Goya products any good? Honest question
18362,hqobmb,Goya making so much bank is gonna make other companies support trump. Goya might end cancel culture and maybe the clown commies.
18363,hqobmb,"This has nothing to do with the current Goya controversy. These have been up for literally months because of the pandemic for all canned goods.

E: At publixes."
18364,hqobmb,You mean like how conservatives tried to cancel Anita Sarkesian for having a different opinion?
18365,hqobmb,the left is totally unwilling to hear out another side
18366,hqobmb,like abortions?
18367,hqobmb,Colin kaepernick much?

Trader Joe‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt sell Goya products."
18373,hqobmb,Yes lol this sub is pretty much Facebook
18374,hqobmb,"No, its not. The same signs have been around for months.  Your republican friends didn't know this brand existed until they did something controversial"
18375,hqobmb,"A year ago if we heard beans and masks were political, we would be expecting the punchline to a fart joke."

18378,hqobmb,Colom-rican? Colombian/Puerto Rican?!? That‚Äôs clever!
18379,hqobmb,Yeah this is stupid. This is a Publix and they have this next to all the canned goods.
18380,hqobmb,"The CEO of Goya supports Trump.

Leftists got mad and called for a boycott.

The CEO said, ""I'm not retracting my support."""
18381,hqobmb,"Welp...

Still kinda funny lol"
18382,hqobmb,It doesn‚Äôt line up. Publix has had these signs on the canned goods since the pandemic started. OP is full of shit about this being tied in any way to the recent statements.
18383,hqobmb,Lol yeah beans being limited does not mean there is a silent majority. This has been going on for awhile.
18384,hqobmb,">Correlation does not imply causation. 

Then you went and implied causation with correlation."
18385,hqobmb,Eat some beans and your love will be louder.
18386,hqobmb,Yeah Publix has had these signs up for months
18387,hqobmb,The CEO praised Trump. Now the left says they must be cancelled.
18388,hqobmb,That's what I'm saying. I grew up with Goya. The only people who are really boycotting them are the people who didn't know who they were in January.

18397,hqobmb,"Publix (so the South). These signs have been up for months. It‚Äôs COVID related, not political at all."
18398,hqobmb,These signs were up at Publix months before the controversy. This post is Facebook quality that didn‚Äôt verify the signs and inferred they were related to the Trump support comments. When has a corporation ever limited sales of good based on political popularity? If the demand for sales is there they would just sell all the product. It‚Äôs not like Goya beans are limited editions or some shit.
18399,hqobmb,Why do you say that?
18400,hqobmb,No you guys are sad for trying to stop people being from being able to buy it. The store is boycotting their own product lol. Thats sad.
18401,hqobmb,Does being Republican make us retarded now?  I thought it just made us racists.  Glad Dems have come up with a new pejorative.
18402,hqobmb,What‚Äôs not to understand? Leftist idiots are calling for a boycott on Goya products because the CEO of Goya voiced his support of Trump and said he wouldn‚Äôt apologize or change his tune.
18403,hqobmb,I found all of them very good (Disclosure: I am Latino).The only problem is the black bean can. I realized that since Goya supports President Trump the beans can not be really black.
18404,hqobmb,"Yo those fruit drinks are like 50 cents each and soooo good! The mango, guava, and nectarine are my favorites."
18405,hqobmb,The beans I have tried are good.
18406,hqobmb,I like their coconut drinks. They are cheap and good for a hot day in the sun.
18407,hqobmb,"I cook with Adobo seasoning a lot!  Good for all kinds of meat, delicious!"
18408,hqobmb,There is pretty much nothing better than Goya brand Sazon when it comes to making yellow rice.
18409,hqobmb,"In my experience, for the most part they're pretty good. They're a bit more expensive where I am so I don't buy that much due to there being alternatives that aren't as pricey, but I'm ok with spending a little more on a company that stands up for freedom."
18410,hqobmb,I love the nectarine drinks and use them to make nectarine cakes- they have good beans and so far everything I have purchased from them has been good.
18411,hqobmb,Yes
18412,hqobmb,Yes they are!!! Stock up now!
18413,hqobmb,hell yeah
18414,hqobmb,"Man good and cheap, if its canned and is goya just buy it"
18415,hqobmb,I‚Äôd like to credit it to the current left stupidity and the brave CEO for standing up for what he believes in....can we just go with that?
18416,hqobmb,Not in Maryland. We never had a caned good limit.
18417,hqobmb,She criticized video games that had a good portrayal of women and would say that because a man is in the same game he‚Äôs hurting her. She‚Äôs crazy.
18418,hqobmb,"Well, yeah. I think it‚Äôs wrong, but I can‚Äôt tell someone else what to do. And I don‚Äôt think anyone else should tell people what to do except to follow God and obey the Bible."
18419,hqobmb,"Seriously?  Colin was held up by the left as a hero.  That's the opposite of being ""canceled"".  He even landed a Nike deal out of it.  

That being said, a corporate CEO just saying he supports the current POTUS - vs. the controversy surrounding his kneeling during the national anthem are of massively different magnitude."
18420,hqobmb,Whats even funnier is that this is from when people were buying food like crazy. Same signs are on milk lmao
18421,hqobmb,I don't Colin Kaepernick at all!
18422,hqobmb,What did Dan Snyder do?
18423,hqobmb,Posted and upvoted right here.. all sides are susceptible to Facebook meme fuckery. Would you agree or are you just strengthening your mental gymnastics?
18424,hqobmb,"It‚Äôs really a problem, the right can‚Äôt meme is a legitimate thing."
18425,hqobmb,"what did he do? he just asked a question.

or did he edit it or something?"
18426,hqobmb,Sad noises
18427,hqobmb,">they did something controversial

Imagine believing that supporting the President is controversial."
18428,hqobmb,"Um.... Republicans don't know about Goya?

Holy cow.  You need to get out more."
18429,hqobmb,üòÇ
18430,hqobmb,"It was never a real topic, the green deal never mentions such a thing. Its just that you didn't read it."
18431,hqobmb,Thanks brother.
18432,hqobmb,"Yes, lol. Colombian and Puerto Rican. It's a common mix in New York and that's how we refer to each other.

All American. I was born and raised in Queens."

18434,hqobmb,"you‚Äôre in a subreddit for fake information, so are you really surprised to see fake bullshit posted in here?"
18435,hqobmb,Good for Goya :)
18436,hqobmb,"I‚Äôm glad to see that at least a company had the balls to stand up for what they support, unlike the whimpy ones that just give into whatever the crowd shouts. I‚Äôm gonna buy more Goya products just because the CEO isn‚Äôt afraid of the crowd"
18437,hqobmb,I honestly don‚Äôt think it was liberals or leftists I think it was Latinos who tend to be democratic.. you can‚Äôt blame everything on your perceived enemy.
18438,hqobmb,Exactly
18439,hqobmb,"Sure, except signs like this were placed on products in markets all around the world due to the pandemic long before anything to do with Goya and politics."
18440,hqobmb,Oooh ok

18451,hqobmb,"Wow! The Goya Ginger soda (called ginger beer, but not beer- it's soda pop) is amazing! It is a seriously stout ginger drink. Not for the faint of heart, but our family now loves it."

18453,hqobmb,Their chick peas are good for hummus.
18454,hqobmb,I‚Äôm a fiend for yellow rice. Viggo is my preferred brand. I haven‚Äôt tried sazon
18455,hqobmb,so if goya tp was a thing 2 months ago you would say the same?
18456,hqobmb,Probably because this is a publix and publix doesn‚Äôt operate in Maryland.
18457,hqobmb,"So, what you think isn't, ""people shouldn't be canceled for their opinions"" what you actually think is, ""people should only be canceled for their opinions if I think those opinions are crazy"""
18458,hqobmb,"A guy kneeled in protest, and the potus called for and achieved the canceling the mans career. What on earth are you even talking about?

18461,hqobmb,"Bent the knee to the left wing mob and the newly Woke-for-dollars NFL and sponsors, instead of standing tall like the CEO of Goya. Had he, he would have been rewarded in the same way. Instead the team is now hemorrhaging fans and he looks like a cuck."
18462,hqobmb,"I don‚Äôt follow what you‚Äôre asking.

I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre agreeing or if you‚Äôre being passive aggressive."
18463,hqobmb,The classic all sides so anything goes argument
18464,hqobmb,"The left does it on a whole other scale. See the covington boys or the two lawyers who were publicly humiliated and shamed for defending their homes from a crazed mob.
  
The left doesn't value truth as much as the right does. It sounds incredibly biased to say but it's generally true. The left instead places a lot more emphasis on empathy and feeling, which is admirable in a way but it leads to them following the rules of social justice in a near religious manner ruining the lives of even innocent school boys in this religion's practice. 
  
This major contrast between the two parties is visible in every major left/right leaning fogure. Public figures the right admires are always pragmatic, logical and are willing to accept bad means if the ends are good. They'll have straight forward non-emotional styles of debate and discussion. Left wing figures are far more likely to use emotion in their arguments. They'll often dispute not the ends of an idea but the way the means make them feel. This is why almost all crazy viral hoaxes in the past few years have been spread by leftists. Most leftists on Reddit will still insist the covington boys started harassing an innocent Indian man, even when shown the video of how it was actually the Indian who started smashing his drum in the face of a child completely unprompted they'll refuse to admit the boy isn't somehow to blame. Because it's not the actions of the boy that they have an issue with, he literally just stands there minding his business. It's the way the maga hat he was wearing made them feel that they don't like."
18465,hqobmb,"What did who do? 

I was talking about how the main post was a covid 19 post when super markets where rationing out products."
18466,hqobmb,Says the one that posted this lmao
18467,hqobmb,"That‚Äôs bs, you know it. AOC even said it."
18468,hqobmb,"The Hill, Feb 22, 2019. Google it. AOC did talk about farting cows and then tried to downplay it. I don‚Äôt know how to post articles to Reddit, but if I did there would be dozens, that talked about farting cows. I also never said anything about the Green Deal, simply said it wasn‚Äôt a topic I‚Äôd ever thought would be discussed. It was discussed, want to argue that point?"
18469,hqobmb,"Wow, didn‚Äôt know that. My mom is a Colombian also and out where I live on the west coast there is not a whole lot of Colombians. Nice to know there are some in New York."
18470,hqobmb,Just about the same isn't it. Lol
18471,hqobmb,Oh then why are you here? We don‚Äôt need your bullshit either!
18472,hqobmb,"Oh my gawd no....

Twitter was full of leftists showing Goya products in their garbage cans."

18474,hqobmb,"So, leftists. Specifically the Latino ones."
18475,hqobmb,"Can it be possible that both circumstances exist at the same time?

Can supply of Goya be short from the pandemic, and even shorter due to current the buy-up?"
18476,hqobmb,Please do describe these death cults I am really curious now.
18477,hqobmb,And what is the death cult you're referring to..?
18478,hqobmb,"What death cults are you referring to, and where did you get people joining death cults from a picture of Goya products?"
18479,hqobmb,Tbh I kind of like the metallic taste lol
18480,hqobmb,"With Sazon, it's just the seasonings. [Vigo](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UCC4q7oHL._SL1500_.jpg) is much easier, it comes with the rice in the bag too. But if you grab some Sazon and Adobo from Goya, you can make some **much** better rice, you just have to measure the rice and seasonings yourself.  

They have different types of Sazon, and the best one IMO is this one, [Sazon con Azafran](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91kyWfiW48L._SL1500_.jpg)."
18481,hqobmb,"I took this as a joke, and put my hopeful spin on it."
18482,hqobmb,"No. She shouldn‚Äôt be canceled. She still has every right to say her opinions. We love in America, we are free to speak our opinion. But we are also free to not listen to those we don‚Äôt want to listen to. So while cancel culture is wrong, boycotting is fine."
18483,hqobmb,Wasn‚Äôt he kneeling before trump got into office? And wasn‚Äôt his career over by then?
18484,hqobmb,"Sigh.  Why isn't Lefty's can't debate the thought, they have to attack the person?

You left he's trolling around conservative subs just doing so people is weird."
18485,hqobmb,"Ha, Kapernick killed his own career.  Same as Michael Vick did with the dog fight incident.  The difference is Vick was good enough to be worth another shot. Kapernick evidently wasn‚Äôt.  The NFL is a business and is about winning.  If you are good enough to get past the bad stuff someone will hire you.  There are lots of examples of pro players doing things that reflect bad on potential employer.  Some of the time their career will survive, some don‚Äôt.  All on Kapernick."

That‚Äôs the kind of catastrophe this whole thing has caused; the weird ramifications I think aren‚Äôt even fully understood."

You have turned this into some New Green Deal debate, and have triggered yourself into a frenzy. Have farting cows been discussed? Yes, which is all my comment stated. 
Now what else?  Because if you want me to go into how ludicrous AOC is and the ridiculousness of her grand New Green Deal ideas, then start a new thread where people want to discuss that topic."

18509,hqobmb,"Sure, they tried to. Those people should be arrested. I‚Äôm not defending cancel culture. I‚Äôm saying 

1. Canceling people is wrong. 
2. I think Anita Sarkeesian is crazy."
18510,hqobmb,">LIke when he was told 2 guys beat the shit out of a Latino man

Never heard of this? Not only that but if theres no clear indication that the assault was linked to the fact that the man is latino, then I mean yeah it's shitty if true but not what your claiming"
18511,hqobmb,"No frenzy at all dude.

I didn't turn this into a NGD thing, I don't even think its good.

But when someone talks about farting cows it goes hand in hand with the NGD, I just wanted to help someone out and dismiss that misconception.

You cannot quote the farting cows and then pretend it has nothing to do with the NGD."
18512,hqobmb,"How many people do you think actually destroyed canned goods they already purchased? 


You're buying into propaganda designed just for you to believe without thinking."

18514,hqobmb,"This is the lamest shit I‚Äôve ever read, Jesus."
18515,hqobmb,I know a guy who works for Publix corporate. These signs have been up for months according to him. Every Publix I have been to in my town (there are 7 I‚Äôve been to) have all had the same signs for months as well.
18516,hqobmb,"Do you realize how silly you sound?

I've never shopped at a Publix in my life.
To my knowledge I've never even seen one, but I've seen nearly exact copies of this sign all over the place ever since the first few weeks of the Coronavirus.

First it was on toilet paper and paper towels

Then disinfectants

Then canned goods, dry rice/beans, flour, and such

Then meat products

Depending on stores and supply chain there has been some ebb and flow, but these have been all over the place. How have you not seen them?"

18518,hqobmb,"You can have whatever opinions about Anita Sarkesian you want to have and that doesn't bother me at all. I just wanted to know if you agree that going to that extreme is bad, even if it's someone on your side doing the attempted cancelling

I'm not saying you can't have an opinion or make YouTube response videos."
18519,hqobmb,"Yes, I can. It was a stupid thing someone, we all know who, said.  I couldn‚Äôt believe it was even said out loud!  If I want to bring up that it was one of the most ridiculous things that had been discussed within the last year or so, then I can, because it was."
18520,hqobmb,I‚Äôm also not a dude. I‚Äôm a married woman with four children.
18521,hqobmb,"Was that guy at this specific Publix?

You people talk in absolutes like you are certain that it MUST be the Wuhan Virus, and it‚Äôs impossible it can be attributed to anything else, even though it‚Äôs possible that BOTH circumstances can be attributed at the same time. 

All it takes is one person to fill their cart up in a buy-up frenzy to support the cause, and it wipes out the already short inventory on the shelf. Why is that not a possibility to you people? 

I know why. Because you don‚Äôt want it to be."
18522,hqobmb,"These signs are totally common and have been around for a long time now, but you can ignore that if you want to.

We both know you want to."

18548,ialylf,"I‚Äôve had threads and replies removed from r/PoliticalOpinions r/PoliticalDiscussion and r/politics. I don‚Äôt know why reddit has these threads if the only politics you can talk about is that which is socially acceptable. 

That‚Äôs the issue, social media has turned political opinions into a social law. 

It‚Äôs like if you hold the door open for someone and they don‚Äôt say thank you, you kind of have a right to disrespect them back or at least call them out for it. 

They‚Äôve turned politics into just this where if someone makes a statement that doesn‚Äôt agree with the majority; the majority then has a right to disrespect them or at least call them out for it. Unfortunately this disrespect goes incredibly far in some cases.

We need to get back to the times where political opinions were not social, with agreed upon opinions becoming the blueprint for this political doctrine.

Instead, we need to view politics and it‚Äôs topics in the complexities that it deserves, and have discourse at length about political/economic issues. It needs to be less of a TV show, in short (both sides) and more of a educational way of advancing beliefs and livelihood."
18549,ialylf,"It‚Äôs not a conspiracy. It‚Äôs absolutely, unequivocally true. It‚Äôs been proven. The same goes for Twitter."

18564,ialylf,"That is not the original headline. The original headline called the terrorist leader an austere religious scholar.

18565,ialylf,"No... it is real.

The headline I posted was the WaPo's FIRST headline on the obit.

After outrage, they changed it."

18589,ialylf,"Yes, give me a minute to find solid proof, but I saw the original article with my own two eyes. It‚Äôs scary how they can revise recent history and get away with it. It's scarier that you had to ask me for proof that something very publicized even happened in the first place.

people can easily say whatever they want withought much backlash and if there is any they can just ignore it 

unlike in a in person conversation 

and this combined with some sites like Facebook trying to only show u stuff u agree with irelevant if it's true or not just increases the tribalism and this stupid us vs them attitude that both sides have developed 

it's a sad state of affairs 
we're all Americans at the end of the day irelevant of party and I do wish people could just sit down and have a proper discussion withought all this dam shouting and misinformation

18597,ialylf,"Yea I mean I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the direct cause of it all, but the people who run our colleges are certainly just as manipulated as the people who i‚Äôm referring to. You have professors expressing political beliefs in every class, just like the kids expressing their beliefs every instagram post. 

Again, further pushing the message that there is indeed a ‚Äúgood‚Äù and a ‚Äúbad‚Äù when it comes to political issues, instead of a disagreement that can be properly discussed.

Those professors reinforce the ‚Äúmorally good‚Äù vs ‚Äúmorally bad‚Äù sentiment and the kids will always side with whatever seems like the good to them, without analyzing its complexities and complexities of probable consequences."
18598,ialylf,Lol.  Nope.  Honesty is the best policy.  The truth will set you free.  And I spoke the truth.  Your comment doesn't exactly do anything to disprove my statement.
18599,ialylf,"The Washington Post is **run** by those same leftists.  That's why they say it.  They don't care about news.  They haven't for a long time, now.  They only care about hurting people that disagree with their ideology.  That's the unfortunate truth.  When you say that you're aware that the left has become radicalized, well, you're on the right track.  You just need to take that one step further and see that it's those radicals who now run several major media outlets, Washington Post being one of them."
18600,ialylf,WaPo called Baghdadi an ‚Äúaustere religious scholar‚Äù because Trump was the guy who killed Baghdadi and they didn‚Äôt even want to give Trump that tidbit of credit which literally everyone in America should in theory agree upon.

18609,ialylf,"Correct, I think you got it!"
18610,ialylf,Well that‚Äôs something the leftist sjw usually say. If you don‚Äôt call out and actively try to stop it you‚Äôre complicit. I don‚Äôt fully agree. But i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just their inaction but that they actually actively support this kinds of stuff that‚Äôs the problem.

Fuck his policies he‚Äôs a billionaire and that‚Äôs the only important thing cause trumps a billionaire too. But look our candidate is a better billionaire cause he‚Äôs 30x richer than trump or whatever the figure is. Try to think like an absolute simpleton and you can maybe grasp their logic , their understanding of reality, and their stubborn idea that everyone in the world is probably as dumb as they are therefore everyone thinks in the same mental gymnastic, unrealistic ways

18648,f72p9h,"So I'm a bernie support, and I'm not trying to attack or anything, just looking for your opinion. It's a fair point to make that Bernie is in the top 1% of income. However he is pretty far from the top 1% of wealth. Either way though, doesn't it up his ethos meter that he's been campaigning for decades to tax the wealthy more, even if that would result in him being taxed more? And being a millionaire, while hugely benefitial, is nothing compared to the wealth of the people he is really vocally against, billionaires. To put into perspective a million seconds is ~2 weeks and a billion seconds is ~30 years. Anyways I'm wondering if Bernie's wealth makes people see him as untrustworthy. Is this a big point of contention for you?"

18653,f72p9h,"That‚Äôs funny, I felt the opposite. I felt sorry for Pete just standing there getting berated by Klobuchar and couldn‚Äôt respond because he‚Äôd be called sexist if he did. It‚Äôs probably worth noting that Klobuchar is well known in Washington to be...a bit much..."
18654,f72p9h,"I disagree. Bernie wouldn‚Äôt have given us NAFTA, or the Iraq War, or any of the myriad of colossal misjudgments the Clinton people have been giving us for 30 years"
18655,f72p9h,They‚Äôre both dogshit lol
18656,f72p9h,Agreed.  I‚Äôm not a fan but a Bloomberg president is less damaging than a Bernie president.
18657,f72p9h,"He was never really a moderate. The only thing Bloomberg is loyal to is Bloomberg. I mean, regulating what size your soda can be? That‚Äôs just the nanny state run amuck"
18658,f72p9h,If they give Bloomberg the nomination it rips the party in half and Trump wins in a landslide. I‚Äôm not saying it won‚Äôt happen but those are the facts Bloomberg is up against
18659,f72p9h,There's no chance after last night. Warren eviscerated him on a social issue that democrats care quite a bit about \[women's rights\]. I'd be shocked if he makes it to the next debate.
18660,f72p9h,It‚Äôs just a joke
18661,f72p9h,People actually like Bernie though and he‚Äôll always have a place in my heart for annoying all the Clinton people to no end
18662,f72p9h,"Well, Democrats mostly like Bernie.  They just don't want him to win the nomination to run for president."
18663,f72p9h,"I don‚Äôt know who they even are. I live in a swing state and I‚Äôve never seen anyone who supports Bloomberg, a Bloomberg bump sticker, it‚Äôs just these weird ads that bug me while I‚Äôm trying to watch YouTube videos  of animals doing funny things"
18664,f72p9h,He's the biggest gun grabber of the bunch. And once they strip you of your weapons you'll powerless to stop the rest of that gang of thieves up on that stage from coming in and taking everything else.
18665,f72p9h,It's an old meme template. Don't try to make something out of nothing
18666,f72p9h,"*shrugs* it‚Äôs just a joke, at no point did I think about the race of the guys. It‚Äôs not like I deliberately made the liberal black out of pettiness and/or spite"
18667,f72p9h,Who cares. It‚Äôs only a meme
18668,f72p9h,# A BIPARTISAN PLAN THAT BENEFITS BOTH SIDES
18669,f72p9h,Actually I think he supports capitalism but still wants our guns though
18670,f72p9h,"He's a capitalist in New York. People always bring up his soda ban and his controlling policies. And his recent idea of ""if you're 95, then good luck to you on healthcare"". 

Yeah, this is the endgame for socialist policies. At some point, the money runs out and you have to **control** people's lives in order to save money. People need to know this is **exactly** what happens if you keep voting for big government.

The fact is that every Republican in east coast states are just the coroners of socialist, high tax, welfare state policies. All they can do is tell people the bad news that the Democrats never told them."
18671,f72p9h,Compared to the rest of the Democrats still in the running though...
18672,f72p9h,"I actually don't give a shit how much money Bernie has. He could be a trillionaire and I'd be fine with that. I'm not a socialist/communist, I don't get jealous of other people's money and then demand to take it from them by force."
18673,f72p9h,"It's a big point of hypocrisy. He is free to give all of his salary and wealth to poor people to help them get insurance and school tuition and yet he is asking me to help pay for it. Rather than doing that, he has 3 houses and flies first class. Do what you want with your money and I'll do what I want with mine."
18674,f72p9h,Bernie spoke about millionaires and billionaires until he became a millionaire. Now he only talks about billionaires.
18675,f72p9h,The big point of contention for most of us here in the republican subreddit is that he‚Äôs a communist
18676,f72p9h,Well she is by far the best one on that stage right now. Better than than Berne fucker
18677,f72p9h,Yeah but I feel Bernie would tank the economy and at least boomerburg would only lose a few
18678,f72p9h,If Bernie wins it rips the party apart and Trump wins by a landslide.  Most Dems dont want to have to identify as.a socialist.. or support socialism in any way. They know that leads to civil war and hundreds of millions dead. So Bloomberg sounds pretty good.. at least hes a real Democrat. (Cough Republican Cough)
18679,f72p9h,"All in all I think I made valid points irregardless and separate from outside variables such as the debate. I was replying with a sense of relating to the twisted leftist mind and trying to focus on their thought patterns and how they could affect everything from a cause and effect, or more situation and logical reaction if you would. And the background unspoken covered up reasons little mike is running to begin with 


But sure I‚Äôll take y‚Äôall downvotes. Happy 02/20/20 I guess"
18680,f72p9h,"I dont think she had as big of an impact as you may think. Women have already had these rights for 50 years so shes just riding a wave, while offering nothing but ""hey I'm a woman I'm special""Everyone knows Warren is a lier.  Its embarrassing shes even considered a leader after lying her way through this entire campaign. Pathetic coward pulling the woman card. Is she going to call the Emperor of China a sexist on Twitter? Guess what?  they dont give a shit. She isnt a world leader. Shes a joke and would be steamrolled by Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Facts."
18681,f72p9h,"They're the people who support anyone who seems viable until they're told that it's not cool to like them anymore.

Likely former Biden supporters, mostly.

Also, hope you know ""Eisenhower Republican"" is what Rachel Maddow and other liberals claim to be. It's made-up term used by modern liberals to try to paint modern conservatives as extremists."
18682,f72p9h,Taking guns =/= socialism
18683,f72p9h,I'm not moron. Just saying the meme would be better without labeling one a liberal and one a conservative.
18684,f72p9h,"I know, just saying the meme would be better without the liberal and conservative label. Could just say both sides agree."
18685,f72p9h,Well he isn‚Äôt going to have my gun
18686,f72p9h,I mean that I know this is weird but the finance guys I don‚Äôt consider true capitalists because they always want some kind of government bailout or security against loss and get rich off other people‚Äôs money. They‚Äôre like the guys in Atlas Shrugged that have no talent of their own they just kind of leach off the people who are
18687,f72p9h,"I personally don't hate Bernie, He seems like a genuinely good human being. I think his policies are impossible, and don't support his politics, but I still think he is a good human, which is more then I can say for most politicians."
18688,f72p9h,well it's one thing for someone to have 10 million dollars and another thing for someone to have a billion dollars. No one makes a billion dollars off their own merit.
18689,f72p9h,"I mean, it's worth noting that everyone would be better off if we got rid of medical debt across the board. If you don't pay a tax for someone to have insurance and they have a large medical debt they can't pay then instead of paying a tax, you now pay more for your health premiums and insurance because the cost of doing business for the hospitals has gone up due to others not paying.

Ultimately we as a society need to tackle the costs of healthcare, but in order to get costs down we first have to get everyone some sort of coverage so that hospitals no longer have to deal with large amounts of debts owed and losses on unpaid debts. 

&#x200B;

I am very much a conservative, but there are some items that paying more into will actually lead to paying less in the long run, and healthcare is one of those items."
18690,f72p9h,well he's more a socialist but i see your point lol
18691,f72p9h,"I disagree, she reminds me of everything I hated about Hillary. The condescension, the entitlement, the indignation of being challenged, the fact that she‚Äôs still at like 8% nationally and won‚Äôt drop out, the fact that she seems like the kind of person who‚Äôd have Hansel and Gretel locked up in her basement"
18692,f72p9h,I think she‚Äôs the sanest out of all of them. And I know that‚Äôs a low bar.
18693,f72p9h,"The irony here is I really DONT think they know that, or maybe they do but this time they‚Äôll ‚Äúdo socialism right‚Äù and stay willfully ignorant because it fulfills their moral agenda and relieves their existential guilt they‚Äôre facing daily as a result of their incessant despicable actions and ideals. 

Look at the new gay cabinet member trump appointed. First gay cabinet member. Awesome. We conservatives couldn‚Äôt care less as long as they‚Äôve fulfill their job description and don‚Äôt get too into our face about what gender they sleep with. Silence though from the left. History was made and all I hear are resentful crickets and silence while they are trying to mitigate the faith people have I‚Äôm their fake support and pride for the ‚Äúgroups‚Äù they claim are marginalized and kept ‚Äúdown by the right‚Äù or whatever the current bs is

If they‚Äôre silent about a gay person making history when they cram lgbt propaganda down our throats it proves that we citizens are a tool for socialist oligarchs to take over, and it proves they use the gay community as a political tool rather than actually support them. Same with socialism and all their labeling and divisive identity crap. They‚Äôll use all citizens until they squeeze what‚Äôs left of them, glorifying them for political points, then ditching them completely once they get their way and their power.

‚ÄúStaliiiinnnnnn nooooo that killls peoplleeeeeeeee‚Äù

-Carl the llama"
18694,f72p9h,"So just titling ""when liberals and Republicans talk about Bloomberg"""
18695,f72p9h,But then the joke is lost and it ceases to be a meme
18696,f72p9h,Hell yeah
18697,f72p9h,He isn't so much a finance guy; he sells hardware and services and entertainment and info to the finance guys.
18698,f72p9h,"That's a good point, and is along the lines of what I tell people when the cost of healthcare is brought up. When somebody can't afford their healthcare bills, the burden essentially gets put on the taxpayers anyway. I think it would be more cost effective if everybody was given healthcare and taxed appropriately. Also the fact that administrative costs account for almost %25 of cost needs to be addressed"
18699,f72p9h,"I have a hard time believing that a person who honeymoons in the USSR, talks up every communist/socialist dictator there is, and says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind being called a communist‚Äù, isn‚Äôt a communist."
18700,f72p9h,"Well there all trash, but she is more right than the rest of them are if that makes sense. I can‚Äôt stand socialism so that‚Äôs why I hate the ones who like it and let‚Äôs be real you can‚Äôt have free education and free healthcare it‚Äôs not logistically possible."
18701,f72p9h,"No, more like the title he used above the meme."
18702,f72p9h,It's more of a fact than a joke.
18703,f72p9h,He's not getting my large soda either.
18704,f72p9h,Even worse
18705,f72p9h,well those metrics are fine and all but if you look at what communism actually is and look at what bernie wants you'll see he isn't a communist
18706,f72p9h,And my axe!

18723,goswgn,"To me, Biden was clearly trying to ""act black."" He was talking real fast and using slang and completely out of his usual slow character, and I think he was trying to prove that he's not ancient by catering to the black man he was talking to."

He‚Äôs not basing anything on fact or statistics, he gave no reason as to why blacks should vote for him he‚Äôs basically just implying that black people should vote for him because he‚Äôs a democrat.

Trump : locker room chat , twisted stories and women coming forward in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election with ACCUSATIONS from 30 years ago.

Biden : goes on CAMERA and PUBLICALLY touches little girls innapropriately , kisses there neck and whispers in their ear.

One of these two people is branded a racist and a sex offender by the media and the dems, the other is an actual racist and sex offender who publically does it on camera in front of the nation !!

One of these people gets impeached for apparent abuse of power and obstruction of congress over a phone call with the Ukrainia president where he apparently was witholding funding for dirt on his oppenent (joe Biden) of which was acquitted over lack of evidence. The other ACTUALLY blackmailed Ukraine on phonecalls with a billion dollars unless they fired Shokin - the prosecutor general investigating his son Hunter Biden over corrupt activities in Ukraine and then goes on CAMERA and brags to the nation what he did !!

Trump is getting accused of Biden's actual crimes but with no actual evidence against Trump he will always win."

18820,in4ci1,"keep in mind it was employees of the Biden campaign, not the campaign itself, while the riots are escalating because the mayors and governors aren't being being effective and aren't Trumps problem yet either.  Once the mayors request the national guard trump should step in."

18823,in4ci1,Sauce?
18824,in4ci1,"I don‚Äôt get this, so getting people out of jail is worse than getting people riled up to the point of violence? I‚Äôm personally a liberal but I don‚Äôt hate Republicans. I just don‚Äôt get the extremist on both sides."

18826,in4ci1,My uncle‚Äôs store was looted twice by the BLM but of course ‚Äúpeople over property‚Äù as if destroying innocent‚Äôs property will do any good. The next 2 months will the most chaotic during any modern day election
18827,in4ci1,I know right? Poor Cuphead and his pal Mugman...
18828,in4ci1,What the hell‚Äôs a cup head?
18829,in4ci1,"Not bringing cuphead or his brother into this, only the Flower."
18830,in4ci1,What do you mean BLM was founded during Obama's term but the violence is only Trumps fault.
18831,in4ci1,"This subreddit is for republicans, so you could get banned"
18832,in4ci1,However I gladly take critique. It migh hurt my pride but im not an idiot. I understand Trump's faults but he has been doing great. The dems however.
18833,in4ci1,"Not all protesters are doing illegal things. Not all cops are killing people. Not all republicans agree with the way trump handles himself. Not all democrats support defunding police. 

I hope that some day soon, we can take a break from what both sides of the media are telling us we should feel."
18834,in4ci1,Yeah but there have been cases where a rioter got arrested was not persecuted and murdered somebody after being relesead.
18835,in4ci1,just so I can be downvoted to hell!? No.

18859,in4ci1,"Of course it is. Because the general media just flat-out won't talk about it.

You've heard about the murderer. You've heard about the murder. But the media likes to leave anything that might make Democratic policies look bad out of their stories."
18860,in4ci1,are you talking about ritenhouse or whatever his name is? He was defending himself and shot somebody in the arm when the other one was aiming for the head. Also the the other fwi tried beating him and taking hus gun.

18862,in4ci1,"Correct, and same murderer was then killed while authorities were attempting arrest him. Are there other cases though? A generalization made by a one time occurrence doesn't bring much validity to the argument."
18863,in4ci1,"He also traveled outside of his own city to be there, knowing how dangerous it was and brought a gun with him, he knowingly incited the shooting"
18864,in4ci1,"Officially, yes, the staffers but like you're tweet shows... More to it than that.

What's crazy is Kamala loves putting people in jail for minor crimes, overcharging them, keeping them in the system, and basically using them for slave labor. Yet she's cool with freeing these tools?  That woman has zero morals."
18865,in4ci1,there was also a girk that was stabbed to death by a person that was arrested for violent rioting.

18868,in4ci1,He was helping out local residents since the police were standing by (they were letting businesses burn) he even gave some first aid to the rioters. The rioters instigated it after he extinguished one of the fires they set.
18869,in4ci1,I was quoting the guy above me
18870,in4ci1,"That‚Äôs kinda what they‚Äôre saying about the cops, incidentally"
18871,in4ci1,"I‚Äôm not saying the rioters were in the right, I‚Äôm saying he knowingly and willingly put himself in a situation in which he would likely need to take another persons life in self defence."
18872,in4ci1,"Yeah I was agreeing with ya.  Officially staffers doing their own thang, unofficially... Probably a lot more."
18873,in4ci1,"I know, and I'm not saying they're wrong. So please answer my question."
18874,in4ci1,Fair enough. Hence why we need to increase police presence in violent cities.
18875,in4ci1,0 people should die before we take steps to stop people from dying. Generally.
18876,in4ci1,"Or try and mitigate the violence, actually listen to the protesters who are saying ‚Äúarrest these specific police who unlawfully killed people and we‚Äôll stop protesting‚Äù that way you get rid of the people who are genuinely just protesting injustice and then come in with the heavier police presence to get rid of the criminals who are just there to loot and riot"
18877,in4ci1,the problem is tgat thise protesters are not denouncing the riots. BLM leaders even call them reperations.
18878,hud97g,I really hope that there is an actual Presidential debate for this upcoming election. I‚Äôve been looking for a good comedy
18879,hud97g,Biden fucks those up so bad. I cannot wait to see this man speak all by himself or even with an earpiece. It's going to be gold. The meme's generated will be legendary.
18880,hud97g,But... but... his speech impediment! /s

18885,hud97g,Biden is hiding in the basement.  The best thing he can do for his campaign is not speak.  Coronavirus is a huge win for him.

18890,hud97g,For real tho!

If he'd just shut his mouth for once, Biden would actually have to go out in public. If he'd just let Democrats get into center stage, it would be over. Their strongest supporters are ""Republicans"" who tried propping up Bloomberg in the primaries. They don't even have their own people making their arguments for them.

That said, the VP thing isn't weird. Because they've delayed all the conventions, he's technically not even the nominee."

Like for instance.... to say we came from apes gets a little blurry for when actually connecting apes to humans. Evolution takes thousands if not millions of years, correct? Then why are there tons of ape skeletons, tons of human skeletons, but not really anything in between? Shouldnt there be thousands and thousands of years worth of skeletons?"
18956,hud97g,"Are you saying that they gave scripted answers to the questions? And do you mean to say that sanders was paid to be in the debate?

What about asymptomatic athletes with no preexisting conditions that still can't run? Is it possible that it's not COVID? 

Maybe massive amounts of dead bodies in freezers in NYC is all a lie?

Just to be clear - I had unfortunately driven by the freezer trucks next to NYU during the top of the curve - totally horrific :-/ 

This pandemic is horrific and any downplaying of it is completely inhumane."
18968,iv6id8,"I am gratified that most comments here in republican reflect that of my conservative family. We are hyper aware of CoViD due to family in Spain and what happened there and felt how some fringe conservatives stage mask/shutdown protests were so detrimental to the situation that led to where we are now. 
If people were more responsible like Taiwan, who did not shut down but everyone social-distanced and wore masks, it would have been just a minor issue. We needed leadership to accomplish that and we had none of such people we can look up to these days."
18969,iv6id8,"Except it‚Äôs not truth. Rely on data, not your emotions. She‚Äôs off by 2.6% which means a he‚Äôs ignoring 125,226 worldwide deaths to misinform and sensationalize."
18970,iv6id8,"Basic math says Covid has killed 198,000 people in the US and that is 0.06% of the population (330 million Americans). A 99.96% survival rate is literally impossible even if everyone in the US already had it. She‚Äôs spreading fake news."
18971,iv6id8,"Doesn't [John Hopkins say it's 3% for the U.S. ](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality). And this number is probably a combination of many different rates.

 I've always been healthy so I don't really care if I get it but I quarentine to protect the others around me who are more susceptible as I have had friends die (they were fat). And just because there are those who don't die does not mean their lungs and other organs are not permanently damaged. 

I consider myself more of a conservative, but when it comes to the coronavirus, it has made me see some serious flaws about our nation that I believe are non partisan. Other countries placing lockdowns and recovering so fast or even eliminating the virus due to sheer commitment while the First world-U.S. becomes the laughing stock as their citizens refuse to obey social distancing because it infringes on their rights or is propaganda. It had been months... I think that the democrats are vindictively destroying other things with the BLM and defunding the police but I see covid as a self inflicted wound... Eh just my two cents"
18972,iv6id8,"The really number is closer to 97% which equals a 3% mortality rate. Since this spreads easier than other disease such as the flu just assume that only half of Americans get covid. For ease say 150 mil. At 3% mortality that means 4.5 million deaths. The thing is these people are not just dying they are lingering in the icu before dying, I think average of 10 days. At 10k per day for icu care average that is easily 450 billion dollars to covid care deaths in hospital charges. Are hospitals going to get that money? Nope. Is the government going to pay a good portion? Yup. And that‚Äôs just deaths. Forget the sub icu stays that will be needed which will heavily out number the deaths. 

Obviously these are just shot from the hip numbers but deaths is not the only concern to the American people. The financial impacts would be far more lasting."
18973,iv6id8,People who refuse to wear masks are as infuriating as social justice warriors.
18974,iv6id8,Almost 200k Americans have died of Covid-19
18975,iv6id8,97% survival rate****
18976,iv6id8,"That's absolutely not the truth. the survival rate is not 99.96%... don't spread social media posts as facts, I expect this from my 70 years old aunt. You are embarrassing us."
18977,iv6id8,"Again. We invaded innocent countries over ~3,000 deaths... wake the hell up."
18978,iv6id8,"The fact that so many ignorant people here upvoted and awarded this is exactly why America is doing so poorly.
Basic math, 200k dead out of the population of the US. Even if every. single. person. in the US got Covid and that same number died, the survival rate would STILL be worse than claimed here.
Stop spreading lies without understanding what you're reading."

18980,iv6id8,"I hear the reasoning that ‚Äú they‚Äôre fighting for something bigger like social justice‚Äù Um, motive shouldn‚Äôt matter if we‚Äôre all following the science (supposedly). A large gathering is a large gathering."

18982,iv6id8,"Lie! This person doesn‚Äôt care about the 200,000 people that have died or the hundreds of thousands of people that would‚Äôve died if nothing was done. This person wants us to pretend the virus doesn‚Äôt exist and we can go about our lives like normal.That is a Lie!"
18983,iv6id8,What is the rate of hospitalization?
18984,iv6id8,"I know people who have recovered from COVID who still don't breath well, and this is fairly common among recovered patients. This isn't just a death or no death issue. Also, this argument is killing every Republican candidate who got behind it. This is an idiotic hill to die on and an issue that could easily be corrected if conservatives and republicans wanted to get serious about responding to this pandemic. Otherwise, be prepared to take an L in November."
18985,iv6id8,"200,000"
18986,iv6id8,"I keep seeing a ton of false numbers for the mortality rate on subs of both parties. Let‚Äôs try to remedy that.

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

Worldometers puts the international mortality rate at ~4.1%. This of course is a bit high, as we will never know the true case numbers. However, the known mortality rate of the flu, which many people like to compare this too, is also higher than what it would actually be for the same reason.

At the time of this being written, there have (according to the CDC) been 201,735 deaths in the United States, and 3,689,081 known recoveries. (Whether or not you think the deaths are false is irrelevant, since they are official numbers from the states). This gives a known mortality rate of about 5.5% in the U.S."

18988,iv6id8,"Typical false information.  But for comparison, how much has it cost to fight every war since WW2?  Because we have more dead than all of those wars combined.  So it boils down to how much a life is worth.  Wasn't that the opposition to ""death panels""?  Nothing like consistency."
18989,iv6id8,Thank you all for the awards!
18990,iv6id8,"This math is very much off. She divided the number of deaths by the population of America instead of dividing by the number of people that got the virus. 

Another example of this would be to say that the fatality rate of the death penalty in 2019 was 0.00000007% (22/328.8mil) when in reality the fatality rate of the death penalty in 2019 was 100% (not counting botched executions)

So for the case of COVID you would do better to take the death number (203k)
Divided by number of people who were infected (6.9mil) giving about an 2.9% death rate. 70 times the 0.04% she was claiming."
18991,iv6id8,"as a republican healthcare worker, just wear the mask. protect others, prevent spread= no lock down less cases. i hate how a disease is political when it doesn‚Äôt care what or who you vote for

18997,iv6id8,"Daily reminder conservatives refuse to adhere to the lockdown, refuse to wear masks and now the US has the worst infection rate and the worse death rate at almost 200,000 dead and were continuing to climb rather than decline."
18998,iv6id8,No that is not a truth lol
18999,iv6id8,"I love Candace.

It's sad that Dave Chappelle attacked her recently, just because she pointed out that George Floyd was a degenerate criminal.

And now we know that Floyd died of a medical response to taking too much fentanyl called ""Excited Delirium"" that makes your heart stop when you do so, not because of anything cops did to him.

Dave Chappelle owes Candace Owens an apology for his race-baiting nonsense."
19000,iv6id8,"This just shows how easily people can be controlled.  Im sure that if the CDC says that shooting yourself in the foot with a gun will cure COVID, then tlmost of these Dems would be screaming at anyone who didnt have a hole in their foot."
19001,iv6id8,"News headlines for Sturgis rally that ""spread covid"", nothing about coronavirus when talking about these peaceful non violent protests in Seattle and portland.. makes sense."

19003,iv6id8,"It‚Äôs sickening. They don‚Äôt care about the elderly, kids, business owners. Nasty Nancy was too concerned without a mask at the hair salon, she‚Äôs 80.

19007,iv6id8,Wow.. very concise and succinct
19008,iv6id8,Bingo!
19009,iv6id8,True news üá∫üá∏
19010,iv6id8,Ain‚Äôt that the damn truth!!!!
19011,iv6id8,[deleted]
19012,iv6id8,"Let's say that number is right (it's not btw).

The medical system is struggling at the moment, with no lockdown or pushing for masks to be worn, Hospitals and the like simply wouldn't keep up with the demand, people would suffer and die as a result and the flow on effect to the community and economy would be more disastrous than it currently is.

It's not just about a survival rate (as important as that is)"
19013,iv6id8,But at least the left do-gooders can feel good about all the good they're doing saving a few hundred lives!
19014,iv6id8,I can believe this. A month ago .07% of texas population had confirmed cases. And that's not even the survival rate.
19015,iv6id8,"We have to also factor in that only 6% of Covid deaths are attributed solely to Covid. On average, the other 94% have 2.6 other causes.  It's fair to assume that at least some percentage of the 94% are people dying *with* Covid, not *from* Covid."
19016,iv6id8,"Have these numbers surpassed how many people die in automobile accidents a year? Or cancer deaths in a year? Or even heart disease a year? 

We've never watched anything this close. I would love for them to watch and report every case and so called death from the flu."
19017,iv6id8,1% of almost 7 million infections is still a shockingly large number
19018,iv6id8,THIS!!!!!!
19019,iv6id8,You‚Äôre still dead
19020,iv6id8,"All you soft, pansy Republicans are arguing within a 90-100% range. Do you realize how ridiculous you sound? We should be back to normal. End of story. Everything she listed is true except the number. And none of it is worth the lockdown. It‚Äôs that simple. Go be soft over on r/politics and r/coronavirus, doomers."
19021,iv6id8,"Am I the only one that‚Äôs noticed how a majority of Biden‚Äôs campaign ads are just throwing shade at the way that trump handled coronavirus... something that he tried his best as soon as it started to prevent it from getting here, (of course he said some dumb stuff along the way), but once it gets here... it‚Äôs a freaking virus, it‚Äôs inevitably going to spread! The fact that Biden can‚Äôt find anything else Trump has done bad in the past 4 years besides handling a pandemic says a lot, don‚Äôt you think?"
19022,iv6id8,Preach!
19023,iv6id8,"Support human extinction

End the human disease"
19024,iv6id8,"That it not the lethality rate of Covid-19. I understand his point but he should speak with real facts, not made up ones."
19025,iv6id8,"This one mentions it within a range, with no source and date May:

https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/496436-covid-19-fear-syndrome  

That's a cursory internet search there may be more but so far I'd say this post is incorrect."
19026,iv6id8,"I like to tell these people that the virus only has this rate because of all the work and separation and masks.

Without that it would be higher."
19027,iv6id8,She is not accurate.
19028,iv6id8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/05/fact-check-cdc-estimates-covid-19-death-rate-0-26/5269331002/
19029,iv6id8,"The more interesting thing is that there's an over 99% survival rate IF you fall ill with Covid-19. But, the risk to any one individual at any given time is much, much, much, lower than this, because not everyone will get it, and certainly not all at once. So, the actual risk of dying or having a serious medical complication because of this is so low, that there was never even a reason to be slightly concerned about it. This was all media hype, from the beginning. Yes, approaching 200K people have died in the U.S. But, that's because it's so much more contagious that influenza, not that it's more lethal than the flu. It's just that a higher percentage of the population will get it, when it goes around, versus when the flu goes around each year. Thus, if you were never terrified of the flu, it makes zero sense to be terrified of Covid-19. The risk to you, personally, of getting sick is slightly elevated. But, once you get it... it's not deadlier than the flu. Your risk of death once you get it is roughly the same, or slightly less so."
19030,iv6id8,"Morbidity combined with transmissibility. Boy, people are awful ignorant over a disease they think might jump from behind a corner and kill 'em"
19031,iv6id8,Either completely made up or taken out of context. You can get a full breakdown of mortality rate for COVID  for every age demographic from CDC
19032,iv6id8,It‚Äôs literal fake news.
19033,iv6id8,It keeps going up based on how biased these people are. As of today it‚Äôs 97%  Candace Owens in a sensationalist moron.
19034,iv6id8,"That number doesn‚Äôt even matter. It‚Äôs to distract you from the real one: 200,000+. These people are morally depraved pretending like it‚Äôs the Democrats fault they lied to the American people and killed them through inaction."
19035,iv6id8,"Depends when the tweet was made. With 300k deaths it is 0.1% of the population. 

However without any measures the numbers would be way worse. Imo killing 1-2% of the population is quite a lot and not unrealistic without any measures.

However I gotta agree that the protests have really shitty timing. Imo people were bored and had no job so they went to the street protesting. They could have done it years ago. Tho it's kinda hard with a 9-5 job."
19036,iv6id8,Entirely made up. 198k deaths divided by 6740k cases gives a lethality rate of 2.9%.
19037,iv6id8,"That number is from the actual deaths from covid. No other outside factors other than getting covid and dying. Which is the true number of deaths it causes. The cdc website shows you the number of deaths of covid that is 200k have an average of 2.68 other issues. So that‚Äôs almost 3 other major health issues that they are dying from but tested positive for covid. These people are also primarily over 65 years old. 

Basically if 200k people jumped out of a plane with no parachute and hit the ground and died but on the way down they got paper cuts(covid) we are ruling them dead because of paper cuts and saying paper is deadly and we all need to avoid paper! 
When in fact only a small percent of them died because their artery being cut and bled out before hitting the ground. (Actual covid deaths)"
19038,iv6id8,"I don't get why conservatives feel they have to take this macho fringe-libertarian stance on COVID and pretend we should all just go out and say fuck it, if they die, they die. Who came up with this approach? It's literally the issue that's going to get Biden elected."
19039,iv6id8,"I live in NZ, barely anyone wears masks"
19040,iv6id8,"Due to my age and health, I‚Äôm not concerned that COVID would kill me. But I am concerned that it could mess me up for awhile. I‚Äôm also concerned about hospitals getting overrun due to its high hospitalization rate, which would mean inavailability of care for other health issues. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm unsympathetic to all the people losing their livelihoods due to the economic downturn. I think if everyone was better at wearing masks we could open a lot more stuff up."
19041,iv6id8,It sounds like you don't have a clue of how many people die from the flue each year.
19042,iv6id8,3 percent of our country is not  gonna die from covid.  3 percent of those who get infected will.
19043,iv6id8,"What nobody wants to acknowledge is the fact that most of the dead were medically fragile to begin with.  I'm not talking about the trope of dying \*with\* COVID but \*of\* something else, that's stupid.  I'm talking about the 95 year old guy who sadly dies of COVID but was 90% likely to be dead of something else within a year anyway.

The numbers are heavily skewed toward older, compromised populations.  If we had taken the targeted approach in the beginning and protected those who actually need it, this would have been much less horrible in live lost AND livelihoods lost

If a million 19 year old athletes contracted COVID, nowhere near 3% of them would die from it."
19044,iv6id8,"Where are you getting a 3% mortality rate? The rate is closer to .3%, not 3%."
19045,iv6id8,"friendly reminder the us population is over 300 million, if even 1/3 of people get infected that means over 3 million americans dead.

edit: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality source on local fatality rate 

and to put in perspective, in WWI, about 100 thousand americans died. in WWII, about 400 thousand americans. 3 million would be 6 times the number of american fatalities in both world wars combined"

19049,iv6id8,"FYI, deaths can't decline. The death **rate** has declined massively since June. Testing and confirmed cases have increased massively in the US, but death rates have actually declined."

19055,iv6id8,"And ignorant of medicine. Candice is great at the zingers, but maybe let‚Äôs leave the medical advice to someone with at least a college degree."
19056,iv6id8,"You were looking for the CDC. And if a person dies because they contract a disease that is exacerbated or exacerbated their other medical issues, they died from the disease. Stop spreading ignorance."
19057,iv6id8,"> The medical system is struggling at the moment

Source? There are thou8sands of empty beds and hospital staff are getting laid off."
19058,iv6id8,You can take the pandemic seriously and also not have business lockdowns. Just advising people to wear masks in public would be a step up for the majority of the Republican Party.
19059,iv6id8,Candace Owens is female
19060,iv6id8,"Most are contracting at nursing homes. This is happening even though extreme precautions have been taken. At my grandmothers nursing home, 92 patients have tested positive, most well after the mask mandate and 6 foot recommendations. Most still have been asymptomatic, including my 102 year old grandmother."
19061,iv6id8,"You have no idea what you or she is talking about.

A mask wont change the lethality in no way. Lethality rate is a percent that stays pretty much the same no matter if there are 100k or 100 million cases.

The spread of the virus can be limited with these measures you mentioned, but does the low lethality rate out-weigh the downsides to lockdowns? It does not, you can destroy a child's live that is likely 80 times more years than a single 85 year old having a disease on top of a disease (you need on avg 2.4 other diseases to die from covid) and losing their life.

New York times wrote that 90% of the tested positives are not likely contagious, because of low virality. Those who get seriously ill are most likely very old, in fact in Ireland for example the avg death age of a covid patient was higher than the nations life expectancy itself."
19062,iv6id8,In the US the flu kills annually between 12k and 61k with a higher hospitalization rate. Covid has killed 200k and hasn‚Äôt been around a year in the US yet. What the actual fuck are you talking about haha
19063,iv6id8,Not sure I agree with this.  There are also ‚Äúreports‚Äù of the long term impacts in patients who recover from COVID.  There is so much we do not know yet...
19064,iv6id8,It is more lethal
19065,iv6id8,"Plus the co- morbidity. Die of something else while with Covid-19, they count is as Covid-19 death."
19066,iv6id8,actually the death rate is about 3% now
19067,iv6id8,"The real question is, how many of those people would be dead by the end of the year anyways? 

As someone under 30 with no comorbidities, my chance of catching and dying from it is lower than dying to a lightning strike."
19068,iv6id8,The riots aren't due to unfortunate timing they were going to happen this year coronavirus or not. The riots are for the election nothing more. If it was 2019 we wouldn't have all this rioting and fake outrage.
19069,iv6id8,"What nobody wants to acknowledge is the fact that most of the dead were medically fragile to begin with.

If a million 19 year old athletes contracted COVID, nowhere near 3% of them would die from it."
19070,iv6id8,You're assuming that everybody who has COVID has taken a test and tested positive. There are vast number of people who have gotten COVID and aren't counted in the 6740K that you're citing.
19071,iv6id8,"Because there are only 45 active cases, all of which are in hospital, I assume. NZ had its shit together, locked down when the numbers got high, and enforced face coverings, self quarantines after coming in contact with someone who contacted the virus, etc. NZ didn‚Äôt waste time calling the virus a Democrat hoax, didn‚Äôt politicize masks, didn‚Äôt dismantle the pandemic response team set up by Obama, because they listened to the scientists when they said there was a likelihood of a highly contagious disease outbreak, here‚Äôs what we need to slow it down..."
19072,iv6id8,"1) Masks work
2) COVID didn't kill me but it was not great and it lasted forever 
3) I hate Lockdowns - and ours lasted entirely to long but this is due to the idiocy of early messaging around masks and spread (It's airborne, let's admit it)
4) I know plenty of people who simply don't care and it's because of these morons we had the lockdown in the first place. 

This made me realize how selfish most people are."
19073,iv6id8,"Very few, most die from Viral Pneumonia prove me wrong."
19074,iv6id8,"Without any protective measure, it will spread to all of us... then 3% of the US will die."
19075,iv6id8,Haha yes... That's kinda a given
19076,iv6id8,"As I stated, it was a combination of many different rates and this is widely acknowledged. It doesn't matter if we protect only a single group of susceptible people unless we are willing to cut off contact with them until either a vaccine comes out or untill literally everyone in the U.S. gets the virus and builds an immunity. This is not reasonable as many of the these people also have to work. 

But, yes, it would have been nice if ***everyone*** had a better approach in the begining."
19077,iv6id8,"I think you‚Äôre so focused on death you‚Äôre ignoring the fact that many people who survive it are now living with debilitating long-term effects that will continue to cost our nation for decades to come. If a million 19 year old athletes were infected, then we have maybe half a million young people who will be suffering for the rest of their life from this. With the tools available to our nation, this is nothing short of morally depraved."
19078,iv6id8,"No it's not, 3% is accurate.  6.75M cases and 198k deaths in the US.

https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"
19079,iv6id8,"Ik, they didn't realize I was telling them they were wrong about it."

19082,iv6id8,How does that matter the death wouldn't count for covid if the died without being tested they would add him to the cases as well.

19085,iv6id8,Easy in the eyes too

19087,iv6id8,[deleted]
19088,iv6id8,"It was more lethal in Italy because their medical system was overwhelmed.  People who could have been saved by ventilators, CPAP, or other therapeutics died in their homes.

Lethality is variable depending on whether you get care."
19089,iv6id8,"My 102 year old grandmother was completely symptom free, as were most the residents who contracted the virus. Crazy. I thought she was a goner when I first got word. After a week of no symptoms I asked if that was normal for their positive residents. They said ‚Äúyes, most never show symptoms, a few have been hospitalized but come back in a day or so, and only a couple have died, but we‚Äôre already very sick. They‚Äôve had almost 100 cases. About half of their residents."
19090,iv6id8,"Its because covid death mean you died ""with"" covid, flu death means you died ""from"" flu. It's two different systems of counting. If you shoot yourself in the head and die, they test for covid. If positive, it's a covid death. If flu deaths were counted like that, half a million would die ""with"" flu every year."
19091,iv6id8,Covid worsens the longes and other vital organs. This makes it unoticeble on a lot of healy people but deadly for people with already bad organs like people that smoke or have asma
19092,iv6id8,"Flu season is less than half the year. Covid requires ICU rooms and more equipment  for longer periods of time while flu patients generally come in for fluids and leave in a day or two. Regardless, Covid has been politicized to the max. The patients dying from Covid are usually in poor health to begin with. My 102 year old grandma didn‚Äôt even have symptoms, as most residents at her nursing home that tested positive. It really opened my eyes to how overhyped this thing is. Not saying it‚Äôs not dangerous, but shutting down the entire country was overkill. Many deaths could also be contributed to the shutdown as well."
19093,iv6id8,"Also, look up total deaths last year and total this year, both from Jan to April. You will see this year the total was actually less. If Covid killed 200k, wouldn‚Äôt there be at least a small increase?  This shows that many deaths were counted as Covid that really belonged to another category."
19094,iv6id8,"since a terminal cancer patient who had covid and died is counted as covid death, the 200k sounds like bs"
19095,iv6id8,Agreed. We aren‚Äôt really sure what this is yet. Also not sure it‚Äôs propensity to mutate or what it could/has mutated into.
19096,iv6id8,"What, you think a large percentage of people who fall ill get tested? Not a chance. Or, that all but a fraction of asymptomatically-infected people get tested? No way. Clearly the death rate of those infected, based solely on any reasonably rational thought process, is practically zero.

If those we know to be infected have a 97% survival rate, then the actual survival rate is orders of magnitude higher.

It could go no other way."
19097,iv6id8,"For what it‚Äôs worth my girlfriend and I as well as 6 of my coworkers were diagnosed positive with Covid 19 back in July.  All of us were ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù in less than 2 weeks with zero after effects.   None of us went to the hospital. 1 guy had a 102 fever for a couple days.  

It was honestly the mildest sickness I‚Äôve experienced in a long time.   If it hadn‚Äôt been for everybody being so nervous about it none of us would have even called off work.  We also worked closely with many other people before going into quarantine who never came down with anything.     So I mean I get that it can be bad for people who are already having serious health issues.  But I have my doubts as to it being a general public safety issue."
19098,iv6id8,Did you get it?
19099,iv6id8,"Nope. It's just more contagious. More people sick = more death.

Learn to do basic math.

Give me your address and I'll mail you a 3rd grade math textbook."
19100,iv6id8,If you don't count co-morbidity no one has died because of HIV/AIDS.
19101,iv6id8,That‚Äôs a pretty standard method of reporting in medicine. People using this to try to discredit the reported COVID and COVID-related deaths are exposing their ignorance.
19102,iv6id8,But also 25% of covid deaths were never even tested
19103,iv6id8,[deleted]
19104,iv6id8,"Nah. Perhaps tested, confirmed cases of Covid-19. But, that's not a reflection of reality. Of the total number of people actually infected.

Come on now, it's time to think rationally.

Don't you think if we knew the real number of people who have actually been infected with Covid-19, and the real number of people who have actually died BECAUSE of the virus, that it would be far lower?

Of course it would be."
19105,iv6id8,"And how many will now suffer from life-long debilitation due to the effects of COVID? These people didn‚Äôt die, and yet due the inaction of the government, they will now suffer. Is that okay with you?"
19106,iv6id8,I agree. People realize if they protest during election years they might get change. It's a smart move
19107,iv6id8,The problem is that we don‚Äôt actually know that yet. We don‚Äôt know what the long-term effects of this are on a human body and everything we do know is only useful as long as the virus doesn‚Äôt mutate too much.
19108,iv6id8,"You are also assuming that all the people who died of COVID were properly diagnosed as such. In other western countries there were many situations where, for example, an elderly care home had an outbreak with 1-2 confirmed cases and, due to a lack of tests at that moment (early on during the outbreak), the rest wasn't tested. If 20 people died, only those 1-2 confirmed cases were marked as COVID deaths.

Trust me, I tried looking at it like you did in your comment, but it sadly goes both ways."
19109,iv6id8,How long did it last for you? Are you doing OK now?
19110,iv6id8,"What becauae you haven't heard that 12,000 to 81,000 die per year from th flu, it isn't true??? I will do your research for you once https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html"
19111,iv6id8,That's simply not true.
19112,iv6id8,You think that the number of cases is accurate? I've got 4 unreported cases in *my* house right now. There are literally tens of millions of people that have had Covid and haven't been tested.
19113,iv6id8,"im saying if you get sick with covid you have a 3% chance of dying. thats what the number end up at, with 3% of people dying. which is the current fatality rate"
19114,iv6id8,What no
19115,iv6id8,[removed]
19116,iv6id8,I don‚Äôt support him. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to kill someone when they didn‚Äôt do anything that deserves to be killed. I‚Äôm guessing that makes me an embarrassment to humanity.

Cause of death would be gunshot wound and they would not test them for covid. At that point it wouldn't matter if we tested them for anything, they're dead.

Republican states like Florida were purposely pushing the numbers down by making the deaths in the elderly anything but covid. I know I have the article saved. Ppl were acting like it was a miracle that the state with the biggest population of elderly ppl didn't have more covid deaths. Covid swept though elderly living homes like wild fire and those causes of death by covid were and are being covered up."

19128,iv6id8,"Look at average death rates by year and the number is still much higher this year.

No clue. Do you know?"
19142,iv6id8,"It's possible, sure. I don't think those numbers would change much if we had a 100% true accounting. 94% of deaths had a co-morbidity, meaning that in 94% of cases, COVID was only one of the causes of death. The average number of co-morbidities is 2.6. Meaning that in 94% of the COVID deaths, each person who died had more than 2 additional causes of death other than Covid. While it's likely that many of those people died *because* they caught COVID, a significant percentage died of something else and just happened to have COVID. 

None of this is to say that Covid isn't dangerous. It absolutely is. If you're not young and healthy, you should avoid getting it. If you have a preexisting condition, you should take extra precautions. I had it back in August and it absolutely sucked. Thankfully, I got over it in a week or so. My 4 kids all caught it and were sick for about a day each. They had it much easier than I did. While I got tested, all 4 of my kids aren't even in the numbers of people who caught it and recovered just fine. Multiply that by millions of households and you'll see what I mean."
19143,iv6id8,"Doing ok now. 

COVID was very light: Extreme fatigue, crazy tachycardia, neurological symptoms, loss of taste and smell, Headaches, and Insane none stop GI problems. 
After COVID walking outside was strange as it would cause chills and shakes and extreme fatigue for a few months. 
Some lasting hart pains but mostly gone now.

I would say fully recovered. And very lucky I took HCQ + Zinc + Vit D + Magnesium + Vit C and Nasal Steroids. I am confident it worked because I took it early a few days after exposure to a confirmed covid case."

19148,iv6id8,"Dude, did you not just read that George Floyd ""died of a medical response to taking too much fentanyl""? That came straight off the coroner's report. 
Nobody killed George Floyd."
19149,iv6id8,"If you think the cops killed George Floyd, then yes, you are an embarrassment to humanity, and for some bizarre reason, incapable of rational thought.

Look, you can opine that George Floyd shouldn't have had his neck kneeled on for over 8 minutes, and ALSO understand that said knee did not kill him. That one cop is maybe guilty of assault. And I say maybe, because he was using a technique he was TRAINED TO DO when dealing with medically delirious people. The knee to the back, shoulder, and yes, even neck, is often the safest way to bring them down, and keep them from harming themselves or others.

The cops in that case will be acquitted, unless every member of that jury is an actual racist."

19156,iv6id8,"I looked up total deaths in 2019 Jan - April and they were higher than 2020 same months. Very small reduction on average but still less. If 200k people died from Covid, wouldn‚Äôt it be at least slightly more in 2020"
19157,iv6id8,"I'm sorry, but cruise ship fatality is not analogous to the population of the country, moving about as normal.

One would expect it to be worse, with people locked into tight quarters with one another, and it almost certainly is.

So, no... again, it's not more deadly than influenza.

It's only more contagious.

If you get it, your odds of survival is dependent on your unique physical attributes, but overall, for the human population, writ large, 99.5% or better.

End of discussion."
19158,iv6id8,How many flu deaths happened this year? The cdc didn‚Äôt count and they mostly landed in the covid stats. So take those out of the 200k. Then take into account the way hospitals get paid for covid and no numbers being given to the public are real other than total deaths due to illness. So covid plus flu plus other illnesses give us a spike in deaths.
19159,iv6id8,Well done Sir (or Madam)!
19160,iv6id8,Is this data with or without the influenza vaccine calculated in?
19161,iv6id8,"And? What... you think I didn't know there have been nearly 200K Covid-19 related deaths this year, when making my argument?

What in the world are you trying to insinuate? That Covid-19 is not like influenza?

That's exactly what I said, numb nuts.

It's drastically MORE CONTAGIOUS that influenza, which is why it results in more death.

Can you not read?

Try again.

I'll wait."
19162,iv6id8,"Nope. In actuality, all it takes is basic math. The basic mathematical formula for figuring the percentage of one number, found within the other. Here is said formula, as it seems you're the one having ""trouble:""

1. Divide the low number by high.

In this case we have a current estimated 198,000 covid-19 deaths in The United States.

And, 6.75 Million confirmed, diagnosed cases of Covid-19.

However, it is estimated that the actual number of cases in the U.S. is anywhere between 6 to 24 TIMES the diagnosed number. Thus, just for the sake of argument, the number we'll use is the MOST CONSERVATIVE estimate (6 x 6.75 million = At least 40.5 Million cases)

So, what is 198,000 divided by 40.5 million?

Answer: 0.0048

2. Multiply result by 100

0.0048 x 100 = 0.48%

That's right, not even a HALF percent mortality rate, at the CONSERVATIVE end of the spectrum.

So, the next time someone tries to tell you that the death rate of those infected by Covid-19 is more than HALF A PERCENT, tell them it's likely even much lower than that.

And there you have it, if you happen to be infected with Covid-19, your odds of survival are AT LEAST 99.52% (but likely even better than this)."
19163,iv6id8,"Pneumonia is not a disease, it's a symptom. 

Saying it was pneumonia, not HIV/COVID that killed a person is like saying it was high blood pressure, not the bullet wound that killed them. 

If it's not COVID, something else is [dramatically increasing the number of deaths this year in a way that distinctly, and mysteriously matches the COVID death curve.](https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ihr28d/oc_cdc_excess_death_data_2020_vs_2017_2018_2019) (and includes more deaths than are currently attributed to COVID)"

19165,iv6id8,How so? Most HIV/AIDS patients cause of death is pneumonia or other secondary infections: co-morbidities.
19166,iv6id8,"Question. If a person does in a car wreck because they lose consciousness due to an illness, what‚Äôs the cause of death?"
19167,iv6id8,"You know that what co-morbidity means right? Those people wouldn't have died yet, their death due to COVID is just accelerated.

What is funny to me is that other countries aren't doing this ""fight over how dangerous COVID is"" besides Brazil and the US."
19168,iv6id8,"Not sure how you could qualify what you did as ""it worked"" when you still got sick"
19169,iv6id8,Sigh of course not.  But 200k deaths does not justify destroying our economy either.
19170,iv6id8,"Doesn't change the fact he might still be alive if he never interacted with the cops. But clearly the fact that you think him having a criminal record is grounds for him to die unjustly, means you probably don't care about what's actually legal"

19172,iv6id8," 

The CDC noted that ""For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.""

In other words, 6% of people who died when they had COVID-19 didn't have underlying conditions, such as diabetes, asthma or heart disease, and didn't experience any medical complications, such as kidney failure or sepsis. But the other 94% of deaths were still caused by COVID-19, infectious disease experts said. That's because many chronic, underlying conditions can make diseases that a person might otherwise recover from, such as COVID-19, suddenly deadly.¬†"

19175,iv6id8,"No it doesn't. Put up the link to whatever bs you speak or I'm calling shannigans on your whole bs story.

Covid deaths have been under reported, not over reported. And you're an asshole for thinking otherwise. Unless covid is believed to be a causative factor of death, they do not report the death as covid.

I was in Healthcare idiot, I know how they report deaths. You don't. Either put up proof or go the fuck away and stay in your idiot hole."

19177,iv6id8,[removed]
19178,iv6id8,"Especially early on in the outbreak, not everywhere there were tests available to test if COVID was the cause of death. So they ascribe the deaths due to something with similair symptoms: the flu. There isn't flu season during the summer, never has been. So it is very odd that suddenly people are dying to the flu a lot during the summer while COVID is happening. I just want you to think about what that could mean, so I'm not going to spell it out more than I already have. This discussion isn't happening in other Western countries by the way, which should tell you something is off."
19179,iv6id8,"That is irelavent because vaccines don't effect the death rate because while less people get sick the same proportion die, but your arguement is that ""that one also kills thousands of people every year so adding hundred thousands more every year isn't anything"""

19181,iv6id8,"I think you missed my point. Saying that all HIV/AIDS deaths have co-morbidities doesn't make sense. The reason HIV is so deadly is precisely BECAUSE it makes you so vulnerable to sicknesses that will kill you.

And when you get pneumonia from the flu, I'd say it's fair to put a point into the flu column. That's what I mean. The flu gives you symptoms that will kill you, unlike HIV."

19187,iv6id8,"So, they overdosed him with Fentinal?

Someone call CNN."
19188,iv6id8,"I'm with you on that one. I was replying to the comment that you don't die from the flu. The flu gives you pneumonia when it gets into your lungs and infects them, causing inflation, etc. The virus directly gives you the deadly symptom. That's the flu killing you.

I agree with what you're saying though. I think the deadliness of COVID has been wildly exaggerated and misrepresented for political ends."
19189,iv6id8,"Well, I do think people should be accurate about how to talk about this stuff. When the flu gives you deadly symptoms leading to your death, that's the flu killing you. \[edit to add\] I agree!

But u/KrustyGymShorts is making the point that they are deliberately inflating the numbers by adding points into the ""COVID death"" column by testing people who have clearly died by a dominant and unrelated cause, but happen to test positive for COVID (such as a car accident).

i.e. without that dominant cause, there is no reason to believe they would die from COVID, rather than just recover (as almost 100% of people who catch it do).

such as this example:

[https://cbs12.com/news/local/man-who-died-in-motorcycle-crash-counted-as-covid-19-death-in-florida-report](https://cbs12.com/news/local/man-who-died-in-motorcycle-crash-counted-as-covid-19-death-in-florida-report)"

19192,iv6id8,I'd love to hear your reaction to this article.
19193,iv6id8,"The 99.5% survival rate is on the CONSERVATIVE site of the estimate. It is currently estimated that the actual infection rate is 6 to 24 times the tested and confirmed rate. I'm using the 6 factor, on the low end of this estimation spectrum. So, in all likelihood, the infection rate is much higher, and therefore the mortality rate is much lower, than even the 99.5% my simple math has concluded.

I've said all along that Covid-19 has a mortality rate that is ""strikingly similar to,"" or ""less than,"" influenza. 

I hedge this statement simply because it's truly impossible to know the actual number of infected, and therefore I do not know with certainty, which way it goes.

The CDC pegs influenza deaths at a typical rate of 2 per 100K of the population. So, it actually has a 99.8% survival rate (scratch this, actually had a decimal place wrong, that is over 99% survival rate, my bad). The data I've seen thus far shows that it's very likely Covid-19 is in the exact same ballpark.

But, again, these are all only estimates. Even the death numbers could be wrong, either up or down, by either not counting a death correctly as Covid-19, or incorrectly (such as when someone merely has Covid-19 at the time of death, but didn't, in fact, die of complications due to it).

You move the numbers even a little bit due to error, and the resulting estimation can go wildly in any direction."
19194,iv6id8,"Technicly, the smaller the pool of infected, the higher the death rate. If more people get vacines, and become immune, the number of people with the infection is less, but each individual makes up a higher percent of the infected pool."
19195,iv6id8,NEW ACCOUNT TROLL
19196,iv6id8,How so? I've always been consistent that Covid-19 has an over 99% survival rate.
19197,iv6id8,"It seems your point is:

* HIV -> flu -> death    
    * Should not count as a HIV death for measuring HIV impact

Which seems like a great way to say no one has died from HIV, but not super useful for tracking the number of people that have died due to the spread of HIV.

Or that you think I'm using too loose a definition of [co-morbidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity)"
19198,iv6id8,"Your comment is completely unrelated to the discussion. The person I responded to was calling into question the validity of the death count for COVID-19. 

You are arguing something completely different. You are saying ‚Äúmany people are asymptomatic or only get a little sick,‚Äù which is probably a good thing. Some asymptomatic patients are still seeing cardiac damage, so it might not be as good as we hoped.  Nonetheless, asymptomatic cases are unrelated to the total death count and causes of death for those people."
19199,iv6id8,"That's not what a strawman is... Your comment is a much better example of a strawman. The guy/girl never said anything disputing people being asymptomatic. What they said was a valid argument to what the other person said.

If someone has lung cancer and covid and they die from respiratory problems. What actually killed them? You can't automatically say the cancer because the death rate for lung cancer isn't 100%. So the doctors put both as the cause of death... It's pretty simple."

19202,iv6id8,"I think this is what krusty is referring to. The average COVID-19 death has 2.6 additional causes of death according to CDC and only 6% of recorded COVID-19 deaths were solely due to the disease. I would not consider myself qualified to properly analyze these numbers, but I‚Äôm sure this is where the narrative comes from.

19203,iv6id8,"I read it. It was a mistake and they don't know if it was removed from the overall tally yet. And it further states there are problems with the states DOH and how they report shit.

Nice try though. Making the exception the rule is another favorite tactic of the followers of the antichrist.

Maybe you and that news station should look into  the nursing home deaths during the first 2 moths of covid that were reported as flu and pneumonia deaths, thats why they had a lower death rate then all the other states despite having the largest elderly population.

Why don't you stop being an ignorant asshole and join reality."
19204,iv6id8,"I just did. Its bullshit and the even state it was a mistake in the article and it was going to be removed.

Again follower of the antichrist, the exception doesn't make the rule."
19205,iv6id8,"No because if 1,000,000 people get sick and let's say the death rate is 10% then 100,000 would die and if it is 1,000 people 100 would die. Now if we were talking about less than hundreds of thousands of cases then yes it could change but we are talking tens of millions."
19206,iv6id8,"Honestly, I think it's funny to compare HIV/AIDS to other diseases. It specifically engages with the immune system, destroying your ability to fight sicknesses. I don't know of any virus that does that. Do you?

But HIV is clearly deadly. If you go into battle without a breast plate, and you take an arrow to the chest, it's the arrow that killed you, but you wouldn't have been vulnerable to that specific attack with the breast plate on. That's the same as having your immune system destroyed by HIV. It's fair to say that HIV caused your death. It's also important to note that diseases X, Y, and Z delivered the death blow.

In contrary, viruses like flu, cold, salmonella, what have you; these attack your body, and your immune system fights them. So when you have co-morbidities, they make it harder to keep up a successful fight.

I'd be willing to believe we agree on that.

What we might disagree on is that I feel the public is being deliberately misled on how bad COVID is, to monger fear and control the political situation."

19211,iv6id8,"And what are their causes of death? Are they related to getting Covid? First of all, Covid isn‚Äôt a disease, it‚Äôs a virus and secondly, how does someone die just from Covid? That‚Äôs not how this works!!!!"
19212,iv6id8,I can agree that the cause of death leaves some ambiguity but 200k and counting is too many to ignore in regards to impact. This pandemic has been mismanaged and alot of people who wouldn‚Äôt be dead are now dead. A lot.
